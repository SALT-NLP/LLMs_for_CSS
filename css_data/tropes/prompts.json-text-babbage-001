You see, they were white officers, we were negro soldiers. When they finished, they got into their Jeep and... just drove away. Something just happened inside me.\nYou hit a lieutenant in the back of the head at 220 yards. That's a nice shot.\nThe Army didn't think so.\nBut they're prejudiced. I'm not.\nYou've got a record like a roll of toilet paper. AWOL, desertion of post, striking an NCO, refusing to take orders, drunk on duty, assaulting a superior officer, resulting in his death. And yet you managed to get yourself the Silver Star, Purple Heart, Bronze Star. You've got a lot of talent. You just don't know how to use it. But I do.\nTell me, son, what happened between you and the Sergeant?\nWe were in a bar. I'd been drinking. He was calling me names.\nThat a reason to kill 'im?\nI would like to die like an American soldier.\nYou've got a good chance of doing just that.\nRecruiting new victims, Major? Heard all about your last mission. Yeah, twelve go out, only one comes home. Those are lousy odds.\nIt's a lousy war. This is a lousy prison. And you have a lousy future.\nYou ain't offering me nothin' better.\nOh, come on, Dregors. It'll be more fun than you've had in years.\nHand grenade and hookers? That ain't my style.\nBut shooting an officer in the back of the head is?\nPerkins, sir. Conrad E.\nWhat's he in for?\nThirty years of hard labor for robbery, sir.\nWho'd he rob?\nAmerican soldiers, sir. Dead ones.\nYou let me in there, Sergeant. I'll kill 'im myself.\nDidn't seem like much at the time. Just a few souvenirs.\nYeah, I know, I've done it myself. Only the Army calls it looting.\nWould the General mind stop playing with his choo-choo and tell me what I'm supposed to do?\nFor those of you who forgot, my name is Reisman. You have all volunteered for a mission that gives you three ways to go. You can foul up during training, you can foul up in action, in which case I will blow your brains out, or you can do as you're told. In which case you may just get by. This is your new home. Do not try to escape. There will be no excuse, no appeal. Any attempt by one of you and you will all be sent directly back to prison for execution of sentence. You are therefore dependent upon each other. Any one of you try anything smart, and you all get it right in the neck.

    "5": "All right, I'll give it a try.\nNo. Try not. Do... or do not. There is no try.\nI don't, I don't believe it.\nThat is why you fail.\nI won't fail you. I'm not afraid.\nYou will be. You... will... be.\nI am wondering, why are you here?\nI'm looking for someone.\nLooking? Found someone, you have, I would say, hmmm?\nRight...\nHelp you I can. Yes, mmmm.\nI don't think so. I'm looking for a great warrior.\nOhhh. Great warrior.\nWars not make one great.\nTold you I did. Reckless is he. Now, matters are worse.\nThat boy is our last hope.\nNo. There is another.\nI can't. It's too big.\nSize matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hmm? Hmm. And well you should not. For my ally is the Force, and a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. Its energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter. You must feel the Force around you; here, between you, me, the tree, the rock, everywhere, yes. Even between the land and the ship.\nYes, run! Yes, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger, fear, aggression; the dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.\nVader... Is the dark side stronger?\nNo, no, no. Quicker, easier, more seductive.\nBut how am I to know the good side from the bad?\nYou will know... when you are calm, at peace, passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, NEVER for attack.\nBut tell my why I can't...\nNo, no! There is no \"why\".\nReady are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained. A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. This one a long time have I watched. All his life has he looked away... to the future, to the horizon. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph! Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless!\nWhy wish you become Jedi?\nWell, mostly because of my father, I guess.\nAhh... father. Powerful Jedi was he. Powerful Jedi.\nOh, come on! How can you know my father? You don't even know who I am. Oh, I don't even know what I'm doing here! We're wasting our time!\nI cannot teach him. The boy has no patience.\nHe will learn patience.\nMuch anger in him... like his father.\nWas I any different when you taught me?\nThere's something not right here... I feel cold. Death.\nThat place... is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain of evil it is. In you must go.\nWhat's in there?\nOnly what you take with you.\nI want my lamp back. I'm gonna need it to get out of this slimy mudhole.\nMudhole? Slimy? My home this is!\nControl, control, you must learn control!\nI don't know. I feel like...\nFeel like what?\nLike we're being watched.\nAway put your weapon. I mean you no harm.\nYour weapons, you will not need them.\nWe'll never get it out now!\nSo certain are you. Always with you what cannot be done. Hear you nothing that I say?\nHow do you get so big eating food of this kind?\nYou must unlearn what you have learned.\nYou must not go!\nBut Han and Leia will die if I don't.\nYou don't know that. Even Yoda cannot see their fate.\nBut I can help them! I feel the Force!\nBut you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you, when you will be tempted by the Dark Side of the Force.\nStopped they must be; on this all depends. Only a fully trained Jedi Knight, with the Force as his ally, will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now - if you choose the quick and easy path as Vader did - you will become an agent of evil.\nPatience.\nAnd sacrifice Han and Leia?\nIf you honor what they fight for? Yes.\nIf you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone. I cannot interfere.\nI understand. R2? Fire up the converters.\nLuke! Don't give in to hate. That leads to the Dark Side.\nStrong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can.\nI will. And I'll return, I promise.\nI saw - I saw a city in the clouds.\nFriends you have there.\nThey were in pain...\nIt is the future you see.\nThe future?\nWill they die?\nDifficult to see. Always in motion is the future.\nI've got to go to them.\nDecide you must, how to serve them best. If you leave now, help them you could; but you would destroy all for which they have fought, and suffered.\nHow far away is Yoda? Will it take us long to get there?\nNot far. Yoda not far. Patience. Soon you will be with him.\nNow all I got to is find this Yoda. If he even exists. It's a really strange place to find a Jedi Master. This place gives me the creeps.\nStill... there's something familiar about this place.\nI don't know, I feel like...\n... like we're being watched!\nAway put your weapon, I mean you no harm! I am wondering, why are you here?\nI'm looking for someone.\nLooking? Found someone, you have, I would say! Hmm?\nRight...\nHelp you, I can. Yes, mmm.\nI don't think so.\nI'm looking for a great warrior.\nOh!\nGreat warrior!\nWars not make one great, heh heh heh!\nPut that down, now we...\nHey! My dinner!\nLuke. You must complete the training.\nI can't get the vision out of my head. They are my friends and I got to help them.\nYou must not go.\nBut, Han and Leia will die if I don't.\nYou don't know that.\nEven Yoda cannot see their fate.\nBut, I can help them. I feel the force.\nBut, you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you. Where you will be tempted by the dark side of the force.\nYes! Yes! To Obi Wan, you listen. The cave. Remember your failure with the cave?\nBut, I've learnt so much since then, Master Yoda. I promise to return and finish what I've begun. You have my word.\nIt is you and your abilites The Emperor wants. That is why your friends were made to suffer.\nThat's why I have to go.\nLuke. I don't want to lose you to The Emperor, the way I lost Vader.\nYou won't.\nStop they must be, on this it all depends. Only a fully trained Jedi knight with the force as his allie will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now. If you choose the quick and easy path as Vader did. You will become an agent of evil.\nPatience.\nAnd sacrifice Han and Leia?\nIf you honor what they fight for? Yes!\nIf you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone.

You need to sail around it to continue your voyage. I could walk across it. I'd be on the other side...\nI have known you to spend hours staring into a deserted bird's nest.\nI could walk briskly, pausing only to take the most important measurements. Making valuable discoveries that could help advance our knowledge of natural history.\nIf wind and tide had been against us, I should have said yes. They're not. I'm obliged to say no.\nOh, I see. I see. So, after all this time in your service, I must simply content myself to form part of this belligerent expedition. Hurry past inestimable wonders, bent solely on destruction. I shall say nothing of the corruption of power or its abuse...\nYou forget yourself, Doctor.\nNo, Jack. No. You've forgotten yourself. You see, for my part, I look upon a promise as binding.\nThe promise was conditional.\nIt never occurred to me...\nI command a king's ship, not a private yacht! WE DO NOT HAVE TIME FOR YOUR DAMNED HOBBIES, SIR!\nThe simple truth is, not all of us become the men we once hoped we might be. But we are all God's creatures. If there are those among us who thought ill of Mr. Hollom, or spoke ill of him, or failed him in respect of fellowship... then we ask for your forgiveness, Lord. And we ask for his.\nGod be praised.\nTell me this wasn't on my account.\nNo, not at all. I just needed to stretch my legs.\nRight lads, now, I know there's not a faint heart among you, and I know you're as anxious as I am to get into close action. But we must bring them right up beside us before we spring this trap. That will test our nerve, and discipline will count just as much as courage. The Acheron is a tough nut to crack... more than twice our guns, more than twice our numbers, and they will sell their lives dearly. Topmen, your handling of the sheets to be lubberly and un-navy like. Until the signal calls, you're to spill the wind from our sails, this will bring us almost to a complete stop. Gun crews, you must run out and tie down in double quick time. With the rear wheels removed, you've gained elevation. and without recoil, there'll be no chance for re-load, so gun captains, that gives you one shot from the lardboard battery... one shot only. You'll fire for her mainmast. Much will depend on your accuracy... however... even crippled, she will still be dangerous, like a wounded beast. Captain Howard and the marines will sweep their weather deck with swivel gun and musket fire from the tops. They'll try and even the odds for us before we board. They mean to take us as a prize.\nAnd we are worth more to them undamaged. Their greed... will be their downfall. England is under threat of invasion, and though we be on the far side of the world, this ship is our home. This ship, is England. So it's every hand to his rope or gun, quick's the word and sharp's the action. After all... surprise is on our side.\nHuzzah, huzzah!\nThis is the second time he's done this to me. There will not be a third.\nKillick, an extra ration of rum for these men.\nThank you very much, sir.\nThank you, sir.\nWhich I was savin' for Salutin' Day, I was.\nWe'll drink wine.\nOh, drink wine for Salutin' Day...\nMy God, what can we do? He has us by the hip.\nRun like smoke and oakum.\nWe'll have to bend every sail.\nWe'll put up our handkerchiefs if we have to. We must survive this day.\nFor England, for home, and for the prize!\nExcuse me, sir, but what are they building?\nYour first command.\nWhat is it with this man? Did I kill a relative of his in battle, perhaps? His boy, God forbid?\nHe fights like you, Jack.\nI'm sorry, Jack. I'm doing everything I can. I know you were close to his father.\nHis father would've understood. He knew the life. His mother, however...\nLet me take a look at that brow of yours.\nWhat?\nDamn, he was good. Just came out of nowhere. Hit us with a full broadside, cut across our tail and took out our rudder. Damn fine gunnery. We only slipped away because of the fog. Quite fortunate, really. He may have had the weather gauge, but we had the weather gods.\nI have no idea what precisely it is you're talking about, but he did seem to come off rather well.\nSeven weeks sailing, and he happens in darkness on our exact position.\nHm. Well, the French have their spies in England and elsewhere. As do we.\nIndeed. If he knew we were looking for him, he could have stood to sea and passed well clear.\nWell then, perhaps he was looking for us.\nOh a week, perhaps.\nA week?\nThere's no great hurry.\nMustn't we make haste for...\nI'm not even sure it was the Acheron we sighted. And if it was, she'll be well away by now. Like looking for an honest man in parliament.\nTell me that wasn't fun!\nMaster at arms, take that man below and clap him in irons.\nI'll rest easier when I know they've reached shore. So many wounded. And only that poor, unfortunate Higgins to tend to them. Still, he's better than no doctor at all.\nI met their doctor. I spoke to him.\nNo, he died of fever months ago.\nLe Vigny?\nYes.\nAh.\nPass the word for Mr. Mowett.\nAye, sir. Mr. Mowett to the great cabin.\nTheir doctor gave me this sword.\nSir?\nMr. Mowett, change of course. Southeast by east. We'll intercept the Acheron and we'll escort them into Valparaiso.\nAye, sir. Sou'east by east.\nAnd William?\nSir?\nBeat to quarters.\nVery good, sir.\n\"Subject to the requirements of the service.\"\nAh... Well, Stephen, the bird's flightless?\nYes.\nIt's not going anywhere.\n...Clearly, something nautical and fascinating just happened; I am at a loss.\nWe have made our turn northward; we are headed back toward the sun!\nLe Capitaine?\nL'infirmerie.\nEngland is under threat of invasion, and though we be on the far side of the world, this ship is our home. This ship *is* England.\nSir?\nExcuse me, sir, but Mr. Blankeney said that you served under Lord Nelson at the Nile.\nIndeed. I was a young lieutenant, not much older than you are now. And Mr.Pullings... Mr.Pullings was a snivelling midshipman,\nstill yearning for hearth and home.\nDid you meet him, sir? Can you tell me what he was like?\nI have had the honour of dining with him twice. He spoke to me on both occasions. A master tactician and a man of singular vision.\nRight. He always said in battle... \"Never mind the manoeuvres, just go straight at 'em.\"\nSome would say not a great seamen, but a great leader.\nHe's England's only hope if old Boney intends to invade.\nSir, might we press you for an anecdote?\nThe first time he spoke to me... I shall never forget his words. I remember it like it was yesterday. He leaned across the table, he looked me straight in the eye, and he said \"Aubrey... may I trouble you for the salt?\"\nI've always tried to say it exactly as he did ever since.\nThe second time... The second time he told me a story... about how someone offered him a boat cloak on a cold night. And he said no, he didn't need it. That he was quite warm. His zeal for his king and country kept him warm.\nI know it sounds absurb, and were it from another man, you'd cry out \"Oh, what pitiful stuff\" and dismiss it as mere enthusiasm. But with Nelson... you felt your heart glow.\nWouldn't you say, Mr.Pullings?\nYou did indeed, sir.\nRun like smoke and oakum!\nNow to lure this predator in and spring our trap.\nJack... *you're* the predator.\nI never realized that the study of nature could advance the science of naval warfare.\nI'm sorry you had to leave the majority of your collection behind, Stephen.\nIn actual fact, Mr. Blakeney and I did make one very interesting find.\nIs that right?\nLet me guess: a stick?\nTell him about it, Mr. Blakeney.\nIt's a rare phasmid, sir.\nA phasmid?\nIt's an insect that disguises itself as a stick, to confuse its predators.\nThis is a ship of war, and I will grind whatever grist the mill requires in order to fulfill my duty.\nWhatever the cost?\nWhatever the cost.\nTo wives and sweethearts.\nTo wives and sweethearts.\nMay they never meet.\nDo you see those two weevils doctor?\nI do.\nWhich would you choose?\nNeither; there is not a scrap a difference between them. They are the same species of Curculio.\nIf you had to choose. If you were forced to make a choice. If there was no other response...\nWell then if you are going to *push* me...\n...I would choose the right hand weevil; it has... significant advantage in both length and breadth.\nThere, I have you! You're completely dished! Do you not know that in the service...\n...one must always choose the lesser of two weevils.\nDo you want to see a guillotine in Piccadilly?\nNo!\nWant to call that raggedy-ass Napoleon your king?\nNo!\nYou want your children to sing the \"La Marseillaise?\"\nNO!\nJack, I fear you have burdened me with a debt I can never fully repay.\nTosh! Name a shrub after me. Something prickly and hard to eradicate.\nA shrub? Nonsense! I shall name a great tortoise after you: Testudo Aubreii!\nThey're exhausted. These men are exhausted. You've pushed them too hard.\nStephen, I invite you to this cabin as my friend. Not to criticise nor to comment on my command.\nWell, shall I leave you until you're in a more harmonious frame of mind.\nWhat would you have me do, Stephen?\nTip the ship's grog over the side.\nStop their grog?\nNagle was drunk when he insulted Hollom. Did you know that?\nStop 30 years of privilege and tradition. I'd rather have them three sheets to the wind than face a mutiny.\nYou see I'm rather understanding of mutinies. Men pressed from their homes, confined for months aboard a wooden prison...\nI respect your right to disagree with me, but I can only afford one rebel on this ship. I hate it when you talk of the service in this way. It makes me feel so very low. You think I want to flog Nagle? A man who hacked the ropes that sent his mate to his death? Under MY orders? Do you not see? The only things that keep this wooden world together are hard work...\nJack, the man failed to salute. There's hierarchies even in nature. There is no disdain in nature. There is no...\nMen must be governed! Often not wisely, but governed nonetheless.\nThat's the excuse of every tyrant in history, from Nero to Bonaparte. I, for one, am opposed to authority. It is an egg of misery and opression.\nYou've come to the wrong shop for anarchy, brother.\nBy comparison, the Surprise is a somewhat aged man-o-war. Am I not correct?\nWould you call me an aged man-o-war, doctor? The Surprise is not old; no one would call her old. She has a bluff bow, lovely lines. She's a fine seabird: weatherly, stiff and fast... very fast, if she's well handled. No, she's not old; she's in her prime.\nJack, have you forgotten your promise?\nSubject to the requirements of the service. I cannot in all conscience delay for the sake of an iguana or giant peccary. Fascinating, no doubt, but of no immediate application.\nThere is, I think, an opportunity here to serve both our purposes. As I understand it, this is a long, thin island.

You've seen one too many movies!\nNow Sid, don't you blame the movies. Movies don't create psychos. Movies make psychos more creative!\nShit...\nWhat?\nOh, shit.\nWhere are they? Where are they?\nI don't know, Billy, but I'm hurtin', man!\nShould I let the machine get it?\nHello?\nAre you alone in the house?\nBitch! You bitch, where the fuck are you?\nNot so fast, we're going to play a little game. It's called: Guess who just called the police and reported your sorry motherfucking ass!\nFind her, you dipshit! Get up!\nI can't, Billy. You already cut me too deep. I think I'm dying here, man!\nTalk to her. Talk to her.\nHello?\nAh, Stu, Stu, Stu... What's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them?\nPeer pressure. I'm far too sensitive.\nI'm going to rip you up, bitch, just like your fucking mother!\nYou've gotta find me first, you pansy-ass momma's boy!\nFuck!\nOw! You fuckin' hit me with the phone, dick!\nDo you like scary movies?\nWhat's the point? They're all the same. Some stupid killer stalking some big-breasted girl who can't act who is always running up the stairs when she should be running out the front door. It's insulting.\nCareful. This is the moment when the supposedly dead killer comes back to life, for one last scare.\nNot in my movie.\nOh, my God. Randy I thought you were dead.\nI probably should be. I never thought I'd be so happy to be a virgin.\nWhy? Why did you kill my mother?\nWhy? WHY! You hear that, Stu? I think she wants a motive.\nWell, I don't really believe in motives, Sid. I mean did Norman Bates have a motive?\nNo.\nDid we ever find out why Hannibal Lecter like to eat people? DON'T THINK SO! See, it's a lot more scarier when there's no motive, Sid. We did your Mom a favour, Sid. That woman was a slut-bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or somethin'.\nYeah, we put her out of her misery, 'cause let's face Sidney, your mother was no Sharon Stone, hmm?\nIs that motive enough for you? How about this? Your slut mother was fucking my father, and she's the reason my mom moved out and abandoned me.\nHow's that for a motive? Maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior. It certainly fucked you up. It made you have sex with a psychopath.\nThat's right. You gave it up. Now, you're no longer a virgin. You're not a virgin. Now you got to die. Those are the rules.\nSo, this game is like a scary movie, Sid. How do you think it's going to end?\nOh, this is the greatest fun. You're going to love this. We got a surprise for you, Sidney. Yeah, you're going to love this one. It's a scream, baby. Hold a second, be right back.\nBut this is life. This isn't a movie.\nSure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. It's all one great big movie.\n. Only you can pick your genre.\nHow do you - gut someone?\nYou take a knife and you slit 'em from groin to sternum.\nHey. It's called tact, you fuck-rag.\nWhy are you doing this?\nIt's all part of the game, Sidneeeee!\nIt's called GUESS HOW I'M GONNA DIE!\nFuck you!\nWe've already played that game. Remember? You lost.\nWhy can't I be a Meg Ryan movie? Or even a good porno.\nI always had a thing for ya, Sid!\nOhhhhh, God! Bitch!\nIn your dreams!\nThere she is! Sidney, hi, what happened? Are you alright?\nShe's not answering any questions alright. Just leave us alone.\nNo, no Tatum it's OK. She's just doing her job, right Gale?\nThat's right.\nSo how's the book?\nOh it'll be out later this year.\nOh, I'll look for it.\nI'll send you a copy.\nHey Sid, just think - if they make a movie about you, who's gonna play you?\nI shudder to think.\nI see you as a young Meg Ryan, myself.\nThanks, Dewey, but with my luck I'd get Tori Spelling.\nCan you see me right now?\nAh, okay.\nWhat am I doing? Huh? Huh? What am I doing? Hello?\nNice try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry up, okay? Bye now.\nIF YOU HANG UP ON ME, YOU'LL DIE JUST LIKE YOUR MOTHER! Do you want to die, Sidney? Your mother sure didn't.\nFuck you, you cretin!\nWhy are they doing this?\nLook at this place, it's like Christmas!\nStupidity leak!\nYou know, if, if I was wrong about Cotton Weary, then the killer's still out there.\nDon't go there, Sid.

How nice of you to join us tonight and add COLOR to these monochromatic proceedings!\nWell when a fella comes back from the dead, I find that an occasion to STAND UP and be counted!\nMiss East informs me that you were expectin' to see General McGrath here. Well, I knew him years ago, but I haven't seen him in a COON's age!\nWell, I can see where it'd be difficult for a man of your stature to keep in touch with even HALF the people you know.\nWell, perhaps the lovely Miss East will keep you from bein' a SLAVE to your disappointment!\nWell, you know beautiful women; they encourage you one minute, and CUT THE LEGS OUT from under you the next!\nI only have one request: that you aim for my heart, my heart which has loved this country so much.\nShoot him in the head.\nDamn.\nYou sawed-off sadistic bastard! You've betrayed us!\nMy dear General, having donated half of my physical being to create a weapon capable of doing this, how did you and General Lee repay my loyalty? You surrendered at Appomattox! So who betrayed whom?\nWe may not have a woodshed on board, but that boy is gonna get a whuppin' anyway!\nWhy y'all look like you've seen a ghost? It's me, dear friends - alive and kicking! Well, alive, anyway. We may have lost the war, but heaven knows we haven't lost our sense of humor! No, not even when we've lost a lung, a spleen, a bladder, two legs, thirty-five feet of small intestine, and our ability to reproduce - all in the name of the South! - do we EVER LOSE OUR SENSE OF HUMOR!\nRita, my dear. Not that I'm ungrateful to providence for bringing you back, but I have to confess - I'm just a little bit curious as to how you managed to wind up with them.\nWell, they seemed so sure that they could find you, I thought if I stayed with them, they'd bring me back to all my friends.\nNot to give you a big head, but, I kind of missed you.\nWell, isn't that a coincidence? Cos, I kinda miss me too!\nGentlemen, I am truly impressed by your effort and ingenuity. Why not swear an oath of loyalty to me, and forgo your executions?\nActually, I was thinking I'd stuff your little half-an-ass into one of these cannons and fertilize the landscape with ya.\nThe wrongs will be righted! The past made present! The United - divided!\nWell, I think that concludes this night's festivities. Ladies, feed him to the crabs.\nGentlemen, since the beginning of written history a nation's power has been measured by the size of its standing army. Tonight that chapter will be closed. The traditional army, to say nothing of the United States, will become extinct, laid low by a *cripple*-!\n-as the general so amusingly implied, and mechanology. But my friends, that tank is just a little hors d'oeuvre compared to what the country's greatest scientists are cooking up for me next. So, if I have piqued your interest, bring one thousand kilograms of your country's gold to Spider Canyon in ten days time. And now if you'll excuse me, I have a tank to catch.\nMr. President, for the last time, sign the surrender, or I will decimate this town!\nYou've had my answer.\nWell, I understand your position, sir, but I urge you to reconsider, in light of the following!\nI have them square in my sights, Sire!\nAs do I, Munitia! As do I!\nWell now isn't this a coincidence? I'm out for a little morning ride and right in the middle of nowhere I bump into General Ulysses S. Grant himself!\nFor four long years I've been chasing the animal responsible for the massacre at New Liberty. I hear tell that's you.\nI am not an animal! I am a visionary, I am a genius, and now I am *angry*!

Well, I have you for the other eight.\nEvening, JARVIS!\nWelcome home, sir...\n\"I am Iron Man\". You think you're the only superhero in the world? Mr. Stark, you've become part of a bigger universe. You just don't know it yet.\nWho the hell are you?\nNick Fury. Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.\nAh.\nI'm here to talk to you about the Avenger Initiative.\nPepper, uh, how big are your hands?\nWhat?\nHow big are your hands?\nI don't understand why...\nGet down here. I need you.\nMr. Stark! Christine Everheart, Vanity Fair magazine. Can I ask you a couple of questions?\nShe's cute.\nShe's alright.\nHi!\nHi.\nYeah. Okay, go.\nYou've been called the Da Vinci of our time. What do you say to that?\nAbsolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.\nAnd what do you say to your other nickname, the Merchant of Death?\nThat's not bad. Let me guess... Berkeley?\nBrown, actually.\nWell, Ms. Brown. It's an imperfect world, but it's the only one we got. I guarantee you the day weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace, I'll start making bricks and beams for baby hospitals.\nRehearse that much?\nEvery night in front of the mirror before bedtime.\nI can see that.\nI'd like to show you firsthand.\nAll I'm looking for is a straight answer.\nOK, here's a straight answer. My old man had a philosophy: peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy.\nThat's a great line, coming from a guy selling the sticks.\nMy father helped defeat Nazis. He worked on the Manhattan Project. A lot of people, including your professors at Brown, would call that being a hero.\nAnd a lot of people would also call that war-profiteering.\nTell me, do you plan to report on the millions we've saved by advancing medical technology or kept from starvation with our intelli-crops? All those breakthroughs, military funding, honey.\nHave you ever lost an hour of sleep in your life?\nI'm be prepared to lose a few with you.\nThey say that the best weapon is the one you never have to fire. I respectfully disagree. I prefer the weapon you only have to fire once. That's how Dad did it, that's how America does it, and it's worked out pretty well so far. I present to you the newest in Stark Industries' Freedom line. Find an excuse to let one of these off the chain, and I personally guarantee, the bad guys won't even wanna come out of their caves. Ladies and gentlemen, for your consideration... the Jericho.\nWhat are you trying to get rid of me for? You got plans?\nAs a matter of fact, I do.\nI don't like it when you have plans.\nI'm allowed to have plans on my birthday.\nIt's your birthday?\nYes.\nI knew that. Already?\nYeah, isn't that strange? It's the same day as last year.\nWell, get yourself something nice for me.\nI already did.\nYeah? And?\nOh, it's very nice... very tasteful. Thank you, Mr. Stark.\nYou're welcome, Ms. Potts.\nOh, my God, you crazy son of a bitch! You owe me a plane, you know that, right?\nYeah, well, technically he hit me, so...\nHmmm. Your eyes are red. Tears for your long lost boss?\nTears of joy. I hate job hunting.\nYeah, well, vacation's over.\nI feel like you're driving me to court martial. This is crazy. What did I do? I feel like you're gonna pull over and snuff me. What, you're not allowed to talk? Hey, Forrest!\nWe can talk, sir.\nOh, I see. So it's personal.\nNo, you intimidate them.\nGood God, you're a woman! I honestly, I couldn't have called that. I mean, I would apologize, but isn't that what we're going for here? I thought of you as a soldier first.\nI'm an airman.\nWell, you have actually excellent bone structure there. I'm kinda having a hard time not looking at you now. Is that weird?\nOkay now, the copper wire - you got it?\nYeah, I've got it.\nNow pull it out, gently, and just make sure you don't touch the s...\nAH! - i-i-i-des!\nSorry, I'm sorry!\nDon't touch the sides, that's what I was trying to tell you before. Now, just gently pull that out, and whatever you do, don't pull out the...\nThe magnet at the end of it. See, that was it. You just...\nWhat?\nWhat I was trying to tell you - no, don't put it back in! Just put it over there, we have to hurry...\nWhat's wrong?\nOh, nothing, I'm just going into cardiac arrest, because you...\n*What*? I thought you said this was safe!\n...just yanked it out like a trout!\nDon't ever, ever, ever, ask me to do anything like that, ever again!\nI don't have anyone but you.\nWe met, you know, in a technical conference in Bern.\nI don't remember.\nOf course not. If I had been that drunk, I wouldn't have been able to stand, let alone give a lecture on integrated circuits.\nYes. Shall I render using proposed specifications?\nThrill me.\nThe render is complete.\nA little ostentatious, don't you think?\nWhat was I thinking? You're usually so discreet.\nTell you what. Throw a little hotrod red in there.\nYes, that should help you keep a low profile. The render is complete.\nHey, I like it. Fabricate it. Paint it.\nCommencing automated assembly. Estimated completion time is five hours.\nDon't wait up for me, honey.\nThat's the coolest thing I've ever seen.\nNot bad, huh?\nGood boy...\nIf I were Iron Man, I'd have this girlfriend who knew my true identity. She'd be a wreck. She'd always be worrying I was going to die, yet so proud of the man I've become. She'd be wildly conflicted, which would only make her more crazy about me...\nOkay, let's do this right. Start mark, half a meter and to the right. Dummy, look alive, you're on standby for fire safety. You, roll it. Activate hand controls... okay, we're gonna start off nice and easy. See if 10% thrust capacity achieves lift. In three... two... one...\nHey. Ow,Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah.\nIt is a tight fit sir.\nHey, Ah.\nSir the more you struggle the more this is going to hurt\nBe gentle. This is my first time.\nI designed this to come off, so... hey. I really should be able to...\nPlease, try not to move sir.\nWhats going on here?\nLets face it. This is not the worst thing you've caught me doing.\nAre those bullet holes?\nYeah, I can fly.\nTest complete. Preparing to power down and begin diagnostics...\nUh, yeah, tell you what. Do a weather and ATC check, start listening in on ground control.\nSir, there are still terabytes of calculations required before an actual flight is...\nJarvis... sometimes you gotta run before you can walk.\nMr. Stark.\nYeah?\nAgent Coulson.\nOh, yeah, yeah, yeah, the guy from the...\nStrategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division.\nWhew! God, you really need a new name for that.\nYeah, I hear that a lot.\nThis looks important!\nHe wants you to build the Jericho missile. He has everything you need here, he wants you to begin immediately. After it is completed, he will set you free.\nNo, he won't.\nNo, he won't.\nMy turn.\nI thought you said you were done making weapons?\nIt isn't. This is a flight stabilizer. It's completely harmless.\nI didn't expect that.\nDid you see that? Those are YOUR weapons... in the hands of those murderers! Is this what you want? Is this what you wish the legacy of the great Tony Stark to be?\nI shouldn't do anything. They could kill you, they're gonna kill me, either way, and even if they don't, I'll probably be dead in a week.\nThen this is a very important week for you, isn't it?\nWe have to hurry. Take this, take this...\nOkay, okay...\nNow you have to take this wire and attach it to the base plate, there.\nOkay... Tony?\nWhat?\nTony, it's gonna be okay.\nIs it?\nIt's gonna be okay. I-I am gonna make this okay.\nLet's hope.\nYAAA-OOOOOW...!\nWas that so hard? That was fun, right?\nYou are supposed to be halfway around the world by now.\nHow'd she take it?\nLike a champ.\nWhy are you trying to hustle me out of here?\nYour flight was scheduled to leave an hour and a half ago.\nIt's funny, I though with it being my plane and all that it would just wait for me.\nTony, I need to speak to you about a couple of things before I get you out...\nI mean, doesn't it kind of defeat the whole purpose of having your own plane if it departs before you arrive?\nTo Peace.\nWhere'd you get that dress?\nIt was a birthday present... from you, actually.\nI got great taste, don't I? You, uh, wanna dance?\nOh, no, thank you.\nAll right, come on.\nHello.\nHi, Rhodey, its me.\nIt's who?\nOh, I'm sorry, it is ME. You asked. What your asking about, it's me.\nNo, you see, this isn't a game. You do not send civilian equipment into my active war zone. You understand that?\nIt's not a piece of equipment, I'm in it! Its a suit! It's ME!\nYou're kidding me with the hand up, right?\nIs it cool if I take a picture with you?\nYes, it's very cool.\nI don't want to see this on your myspace page. Please no gang signs.\nNo, throw it up. I'm kidding. Yeah, peace. I love peace. I'd be out of a job for peace.\nWill that be all, Mr. Stark?\nYes, that will be all, Miss. Potts.\nWhat the hell did you do to me?\nWhat I did is to save your life. That is an electromagnet, hooked up to a car battery. I removed as much shrapnel from your chest as I could, but there are still some pieces left. I've seen plenty of injuries like that. In my village we call those casualties \"the walking dead,\" because they take about a week to reach your heart.\nWhat do you want me to do with this?\nThat? Destroy it. Incinerate it.\nYou don't want to keep it?\nPepper, I've been called many things. Nostalgic is not one of them.\nThat doesn't look like the Jericho missile.\nThat's because it is a miniaturized arc reactor. I've got a big one powering my factory at home.\nWhat will it generate?\nIf my math is right - and it always is - three gigajoules per second.\nThat could run your heart for fifty lifetimes!\nYeah... or something big for fifteen minutes.\nTony! Remember me?\nSure don't.\nThree hours! Three hours you've kept me standing here!\nWaiting on you now.\nI never got to say goodbye to my father. There's questions I would've asked him. I would've asked him how he felt about what his company did, if he was conflicted, if he ever had doubts. Or maybe he was every inch of man we remember from the newsreels. I saw young Americans killed by the very weapons I created to defend them and protect them. And I saw that I had become part of a system that is comfortable with zero-accountability.\nMr. Stark! What happened over there?\nI had my eyes opened. I came to realize that I had more to offer this world than just making things that blow up. And that is why, effective immediately, I am shutting down the weapons manufacturing division of Stark Industries.\nGive me a scotch. I'm starving.\nI just want you to reach in, and gently lift the wire out.\nIs it safe?\nYeah. It should be fine. It's just like Operation, just don't let it touch the socket.\nWhat do you mean, Operation?\nIt's just a game, never mind. Just gently lift the wire, okay? All right...\nYou know, I... uh... I don't think that I'm qualified to do that.\nNo, no. You're fine. You are the most capable, qualified, trustworthy person I've ever met, you'll do great. Is it too much to ask? 'Cause I really need your help here.\nIs this what you call accountability?\nWhen were these taken?\nYesterday.\nI didn't authorize this.\nWell, your company did.\nWell I'm not my company!\nWhat's better, winning all that money or not caring about it?\nHey Tony.\nI'm sorry. This is the fun-vee. The hum-drum-vee is back there.\nWhat the hell is that noise?\nI'm driving with the top down.\nWell, I need your help right now.\nFunny how that works, huh?\nYeah. Speaking of funny, we got a weapons depot that was just blown up a few klicks from where you were being held.\nWell, I'd say that's a hot spot. Sounds...\n...sounds like someone stepped in and did your job for you.\nWhy do you sound out of breath?\nI'm not. I was just jogging in the canyon.\nI thought you were driving.\nRight, I was driving... to the canyon... where I'm gonna jog.\nYou sure you don't have any tech in that area I should know about?\nNope.\nGood, because I'm looking at something right now and we're about to blow it to kingdom come.\nOh... ah... EWW, there's pus!\nIt's not pus. It's an inorganic plasmic discharge. It's from the device, not my body.\nIt smells!\nYeah, it does.\nWell, Tony Stark!\nOh, hey.\nFancy seeing you here.\nCarrie.\nChristine.\nThat's right.\nYou have a lot of nerve showing up here tonight. Can I at least get a reaction from you?\nPanic. I would say panic is my reaction.\nI was referring to your company's involvement in this latest atrocity.\nYeah, they just put my name on the invitation, I don't know what to tell you.\nTony, you have to go to the hospital. The doctor has to look at you.\nI don't have to do anything. I've been in captivity for three months. There are two things I want to do. One, I want an American cheeseburger, and the other...\nThat's enough of that.\nIt's not what you think. I want you to call for a press conference.\nCall for a press conference? What on earth for?\nHogan, drive. Cheeseburger first.\nOkay, this is where I don't want to be.\nNot bad.\nLooking great, Hef.\nWhy aren't you wearing those pajamas I got you?\nGood night, Tony...\nIs it true that you went twelve-for-twelve with the Maxim Girls last year?\nThat is an excellent question. Yes and no. March and I had a scheduling conflict but fortunately the Christmas cover was twins.\nWhatcha readin'... platypus?\nNothin'.\nCome on sour patch.\nI told you I'm not sour...\n...don't be mad...\n...i'm not mad, i'm indifferent, ok.\nI said I was sorry.\nYou don't need to apologize to me cause I'm not mad.\nGood morning Mr. Stark.\nHi, I said I was sorry.\n...i'm just indifferent right now.\nHot towel?\nYou don't respect yourself so I know you don't respect me...\n...I respect you...\n...so I'm just your baby sitter. so when you need your diaper changed\nthank you\nlet me know and I'll get you a bottle, ok?\nHey! Heat up the saki will ya? Thanks for reminding me.\nI'm not talkin about a... we're not drinking we're working right now.\nYou are institutionally incapable of being responsible.\nIt would be irresponsible NOT to drink. I'm just talking about a night cap here.\nHot saki?\nYes, 2 please.\nNo... just... I'm not drinking. I don't want any.\nThat's what I'm talking about, when I get up in the morning and I'm puttin on my uniform you know what I recognize? I see in the mirror that every person with this uniform on, GOT MY BACK!\nyou know, i'm not... i'm not... like you... aren't you just a little distracted right now?\nyou don't have to be like me, but you can be more and you just don't see it. No I can't be distracted right now!\nAttitude control is a little sluggish above 15,000 meters, I'm guessing icing is the probable cause.\nA very astute observation, sir. Perhaps, if you intend to visit other planets, we should improve the exosystems.\nConnect to the sys. co. Have it reconfigure the shell metals. Use the gold titanium alloy from the seraphim tactical satellite. That should ensure a fuselage integrity while while maintaining power-to-weight ratio. Got it?\nSheesh o besh.\nGood roll.\nWe're gonna let it ride! Give me a hand, will you? Give me a little something-something.\nOkay, you too.\nI don't blow on a man's dice.\nCome on, honey bear.\nThere it is. Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes rolls! And...\nTwo craps. Line away.\nThat's what happens.\nWorse things have happened.\nI thought I lost you back there!\nYou did, sir.\nI would like a vodka martini, please.\nOkay.\nVery dry, with olives, a lot of olives. Like, at least three olives.\nTwo vodka martinis, extra dry, extra olives, extra... fast.\nHow'd it go?\nOh, that bad, huh?\nJust because I brought pizza back from New York doesn't mean it went bad.\nI got stuck doing a piece for Vanity Fair.\nGimme a gun! Gimme a gun!\nOkay, let's see what this thing can do. What's SR-71's record?\nThe altitude record for fixed wing flight is 85,000 feet, sir.\nRecords are made to be broken! Come on!\nI think you got a lot of my weapons.\nThere's been speculation that I was involved in the events that occurred on the freeway and the rooftop...\nI'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you honestly expect us to believe that that was a bodyguard in a suit that conveniently appeared, despite the fact that...\nI know that it's confusing. It is one thing to question the official story, and another thing entirely to make wild accusations, or insinuate that I'm a superhero.\nI never said you were a superhero.\nDidn't?\nMmm-mmm.\nWell, good, because that would be outlandish and, uh, fantastic.

I feel like you're gonna pull over and snuff me. What, you're not allowed to talk? Hey, Forrest!\nWe can talk, sir.\nOh, I see. So it's personal.\nNo, you intimidate them.\nGood God, you're a woman! I honestly, I couldn't have called that. I mean, I would apologize, but isn't that what we're going for here? I thought of you as a soldier first.\nI'm an airman.\nWell, you have actually excellent bone structure there. I'm kinda having a hard time not looking at you now. Is that weird?\nOkay now, the copper wire - you got it?\nYeah, I've got it.\nNow pull it out, gently, and just make sure you don't touch the s...\nAH! - i-i-i-des!\nSorry, I'm sorry!\nDon't touch the sides, that's what I was trying to tell you before. Now, just gently pull that out, and whatever you do, don't pull out the...\nThe magnet at the end of it. See, that was it. You just...\nWhat?\nWhat I was trying to tell you - no, don't put it back in! Just put it over there, we have to hurry...\nWhat's wrong?\nOh, nothing, I'm just going into cardiac arrest, because you...\n*What*? I thought you said this was safe!\n...just yanked it out like a trout!\nDon't ever, ever, ever, ask me to do anything like that, ever again!\nI don't have anyone but you.\nWe met, you know, in a technical conference in Bern.\nI don't remember.\nOf course not. If I had been that drunk, I wouldn't have been able to stand, let alone give a lecture on integrated circuits.\nYes. Shall I render using proposed specifications?\nThrill me.\nThe render is complete.\nA little ostentatious, don't you think?\nWhat was I thinking? You're usually so discreet.\nTell you what. Throw a little hotrod red in there.\nYes, that should help you keep a low profile. The render is complete.\nHey, I like it. Fabricate it. Paint it.\nCommencing automated assembly. Estimated completion time is five hours.\nDon't wait up for me, honey.\nThat's the coolest thing I've ever seen.\nNot bad, huh?\nGood boy...\nIf I were Iron Man, I'd have this girlfriend who knew my true identity. She'd be a wreck. She'd always be worrying I was going to die, yet so proud of the man I've become. She'd be wildly conflicted, which would only make her more crazy about me...\nOkay, let's do this right. Start mark, half a meter and to the right. Dummy, look alive, you're on standby for fire safety. You, roll it. Activate hand controls... okay, we're gonna start off nice and easy. See if 10% thrust capacity achieves lift. In three... two... one...\nHey. Ow,Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah.\nIt is a tight fit sir.\nHey, Ah.\nSir the more you struggle the more this is going to hurt\nBe gentle. This is my first time.\nI designed this to come off, so... hey. I really should be able to...\nPlease, try not to move sir.\nWhats going on here?\nLets face it. This is not the worst thing you've caught me doing.\nAre those bullet holes?\nYeah, I can fly.\nTest complete. Preparing to power down and begin diagnostics...\nUh, yeah, tell you what. Do a weather and ATC check, start listening in on ground control.\nSir, there are still terabytes of calculations required before an actual flight is...\nJarvis... sometimes you gotta run before you can walk.\nMr. Stark.\nYeah?\nAgent Coulson.\nOh, yeah, yeah, yeah, the guy from the...\nStrategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division.\nWhew! God, you really need a new name for that.\nYeah, I hear that a lot.\nThis looks important!\nHe wants you to build the Jericho missile. He has everything you need here, he wants you to begin immediately. After it is completed, he will set you free.\nNo, he won't.\nNo, he won't.\nMy turn.\nI thought you said you were done making weapons?\nIt isn't. This is a flight stabilizer. It's completely harmless.\nI didn't expect that.\nDid you see that? Those are YOUR weapons... in the hands of those murderers! Is this what you want? Is this what you wish the legacy of the great Tony Stark to be?\nI shouldn't do anything. They could kill you, they're gonna kill me, either way, and even if they don't, I'll probably be dead in a week.\nThen this is a very important week for you, isn't it?\nWe have to hurry. Take this, take this...\nOkay, okay...\nNow you have to take this wire and attach it to the base plate, there.\nOkay... Tony?\nWhat?\nTony, it's gonna be okay.\nIs it?\nIt's gonna be okay. I-I am gonna make this okay.\nLet's hope.\nYAAA-OOOOOW...!\nWas that so hard? That was fun, right?\nYou are supposed to be halfway around the world by now.\nHow'd she take it?\nLike a champ.\nWhy are you trying to hustle me out of here?\nYour flight was scheduled to leave an hour and a half ago.\nIt's funny, I though with it being my plane and all that it would just wait for me.\nTony, I need to speak to you about a couple of things before I get you out...\nI mean, doesn't it kind of defeat the whole purpose of having your own plane if it departs before you arrive?\nTo Peace.\nWhere'd you get that dress?\nIt was a birthday present... from you, actually.\nI got great taste, don't I? You, uh, wanna dance?\nOh, no, thank you.\nAll right, come on.\nHello.\nHi, Rhodey, its me.\nIt's who?\nOh, I'm sorry, it is ME. You asked. What your asking about, it's me.\nNo, you see, this isn't a game. You do not send civilian equipment into my active war zone. You understand that?\nIt's not a piece of equipment, I'm in it! Its a suit! It's ME!\nYou're kidding me with the hand up, right?\nIs it cool if I take a picture with you?\nYes, it's very cool.\nI don't want to see this on your myspace page. Please no gang signs.\nNo, throw it up. I'm kidding. Yeah, peace. I love peace. I'd be out of a job for peace.\nWill that be all, Mr. Stark?\nYes, that will be all, Miss. Potts.\nWhat the hell did you do to me?\nWhat I did is to save your life. That is an electromagnet, hooked up to a car battery. I removed as much shrapnel from your chest as I could, but there are still some pieces left. I've seen plenty of injuries like that. In my village we call those casualties \"the walking dead,\" because they take about a week to reach your heart.\nWhat do you want me to do with this?\nThat? Destroy it. Incinerate it.\nYou don't want to keep it?\nPepper, I've been called many things. Nostalgic is not one of them.\nThat doesn't look like the Jericho missile.\nThat's because it is a miniaturized arc reactor. I've got a big one powering my factory at home.\nWhat will it generate?\nIf my math is right - and it always is - three gigajoules per second.\nThat could run your heart for fifty lifetimes!\nYeah... or something big for fifteen minutes.\nTony! Remember me?\nSure don't.\nThree hours! Three hours you've kept me standing here!\nWaiting on you now.\nI never got to say goodbye to my father. There's questions I would've asked him. I would've asked him how he felt about what his company did, if he was conflicted, if he ever had doubts. Or maybe he was every inch of man we remember from the newsreels. I saw young Americans killed by the very weapons I created to defend them and protect them. And I saw that I had become part of a system that is comfortable with zero-accountability.\nMr. Stark! What happened over there?\nI had my eyes opened. I came to realize that I had more to offer this world than just making things that blow up. And that is why, effective immediately, I am shutting down the weapons manufacturing division of Stark Industries.\nGive me a scotch. I'm starving.\nI just want you to reach in, and gently lift the wire out.\nIs it safe?\nYeah. It should be fine. It's just like Operation, just don't let it touch the socket.\nWhat do you mean, Operation?\nIt's just a game, never mind. Just gently lift the wire, okay? All right...\nYou know, I... uh... I don't think that I'm qualified to do that.\nNo, no. You're fine. You are the most capable, qualified, trustworthy person I've ever met, you'll do great. Is it too much to ask? 'Cause I really need your help here.\nIs this what you call accountability?\nWhen were these taken?\nYesterday.\nI didn't authorize this.\nWell, your company did.\nWell I'm not my company!\nWhat's better, winning all that money or not caring about it?\nHey Tony.\nI'm sorry. This is the fun-vee. The hum-drum-vee is back there.\nWhat the hell is that noise?\nI'm driving with the top down.\nWell, I need your help right now.\nFunny how that works, huh?\nYeah. Speaking of funny, we got a weapons depot that was just blown up a few klicks from where you were being held.\nWell, I'd say that's a hot spot. Sounds...\n...sounds like someone stepped in and did your job for you.\nWhy do you sound out of breath?\nI'm not. I was just jogging in the canyon.\nI thought you were driving.\nRight, I was driving... to the canyon... where I'm gonna jog.\nYou sure you don't have any tech in that area I should know about?\nNope.\nGood, because I'm looking at something right now and we're about to blow it to kingdom come.\nOh... ah... EWW, there's pus!\nIt's not pus. It's an inorganic plasmic discharge. It's from the device, not my body.\nIt smells!\nYeah, it does.\nWell, Tony Stark!\nOh, hey.\nFancy seeing you here.\nCarrie.\nChristine.\nThat's right.\nYou have a lot of nerve showing up here tonight. Can I at least get a reaction from you?\nPanic. I would say panic is my reaction.\nI was referring to your company's involvement in this latest atrocity.\nYeah, they just put my name on the invitation, I don't know what to tell you.\nTony, you have to go to the hospital. The doctor has to look at you.\nI don't have to do anything. I've been in captivity for three months. There are two things I want to do. One, I want an American cheeseburger, and the other...\nThat's enough of that.\nIt's not what you think. I want you to call for a press conference.\nCall for a press conference? What on earth for?\nHogan, drive. Cheeseburger first.\nOkay, this is where I don't want to be.\nNot bad.\nLooking great, Hef.\nWhy aren't you wearing those pajamas I got you?\nGood night, Tony...\nIs it true that you went twelve-for-twelve with the Maxim Girls last year?\nThat is an excellent question. Yes and no. March and I had a scheduling conflict but fortunately the Christmas cover was twins.\nWhatcha readin'... platypus?\nNothin'.\nCome on sour patch.\nI told you I'm not sour...\n...don't be mad...\n...i'm not mad, i'm indifferent, ok.\nI said I was sorry.\nYou don't need to apologize to me cause I'm not mad.\nGood morning Mr. Stark.\nHi, I said I was sorry.\n...i'm just indifferent right now.\nHot towel?\nYou don't respect yourself so I know you don't respect me...\n...I respect you...\n...so I'm just your baby sitter. so when you need your diaper changed\nthank you\nlet me know and I'll get you a bottle, ok?\nHey! Heat up the saki will ya? Thanks for reminding me.\nI'm not talkin about a... we're not drinking we're working right now.\nYou are institutionally incapable of being responsible.\nIt would be irresponsible NOT to drink. I'm just talking about a night cap here.\nHot saki?\nYes, 2 please.\nNo... just... I'm not drinking. I don't want any.\nThat's what I'm talking about, when I get up in the morning and I'm puttin on my uniform you know what I recognize? I see in the mirror that every person with this uniform on, GOT MY BACK!\nyou know, i'm not... i'm not... like you... aren't you just a little distracted right now?\nyou don't have to be like me, but you can be more and you just don't see it. No I can't be distracted right now!\nAttitude control is a little sluggish above 15,000 meters, I'm guessing icing is the probable cause.\nA very astute observation, sir. Perhaps, if you intend to visit other planets, we should improve the exosystems.\nConnect to the sys. co. Have it reconfigure the shell metals. Use the gold titanium alloy from the seraphim tactical satellite. That should ensure a fuselage integrity while while maintaining power-to-weight ratio. Got it?\nSheesh o besh.\nGood roll.\nWe're gonna let it ride! Give me a hand, will you? Give me a little something-something.\nOkay, you too.\nI don't blow on a man's dice.\nCome on, honey bear.\nThere it is. Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes rolls! And...\nTwo craps. Line away.\nThat's what happens.\nWorse things have happened.\nI thought I lost you back there!\nYou did, sir.\nI would like a vodka martini, please.\nOkay.\nVery dry, with olives, a lot of olives. Like, at least three olives.\nTwo vodka martinis, extra dry, extra olives, extra... fast.\nHow'd it go?\nOh, that bad, huh?\nJust because I brought pizza back from New York doesn't mean it went bad.\nI got stuck doing a piece for Vanity Fair.\nGimme a gun! Gimme a gun!\nOkay, let's see what this thing can do. What's SR-71's record?\nThe altitude record for fixed wing flight is 85,000 feet, sir.\nRecords are made to be broken! Come on!\nI think you got a lot of my weapons.\nThere's been speculation that I was involved in the events that occurred on the freeway and the rooftop...\nI'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you honestly expect us to believe that that was a bodyguard in a suit that conveniently appeared, despite the fact that...\nI know that it's confusing. It is one thing to question the official story, and another thing entirely to make wild accusations, or insinuate that I'm a superhero.\nI never said you were a superhero.\nDidn't?\nMmm-mmm.\nWell, good, because that would be outlandish and, uh, fantastic. I'm just not the hero type. Clearly. With this laundry list of character defects, all the mistakes I've made, largely public.\nJust stick to the cards, man.\nYeah, okay.\nThe truth is...\nI am Iron Man.\nYou got a family?\nYes, and I will see them when I leave here. And you, Stark?\nNo.\nSo you're a man who has everything... and nothing.\nIron Man. That's kind of catchy. It's got a nice ring to it. I mean it's not technically accurate. The suit's a gold titanium alloy, but it's kind of provocative, the imagery anyway.\nWe gotta go. Come on, move with me. We got a plan, and we're going to stick to it.\nThis was always the plan, Stark...\nCome on, you're going to go see your family. Get up.\nMy family is dead, Stark... and I'm going to see them now. It's okay, I want this... I want this.\nThank you for saving me.\nDon't waste it... don't waste your life, Stark.\nDay 11, Test 37, Configuration 2.0. For lack of a better option, Dummy is still on fire safety.\nIf you douse me again, and I'm not on fire, I'm donating you to a city college. Seriously, we're just gonna start off with 1% thrust capacity. And three... two... one.\nPlease don't follow me around with it either because I feel like I'm going to catch on fire spontaneously. Just stand down. If something happens, then come in.\nTony, you know that I would help you with anything, but I cannot help you if you're going to start all this again.\nThere is nothing except this. There's no art opening, no charity, nothing to sign. There's the next mission, and nothing else.\nIs that so? Well, then I quit.\nYou stood by my side all these years while I reaped the benefits of destruction. Now that I'm trying to protect the people I've put in harm's way, you're going to walk out?\nYou're going to kill yourself, Tony. I'm not going to be a part of it.\nI shouldn't be alive... unless it was for a reason. I'm not crazy, Pepper. I just finally know what I have to do. And I know in my heart that it's right.\nWhat is going on here?\nLet's face it, this is not the worst thing you've caught me doing.\nAre those bullet holes?\nAm I making you uncomfortable?\nOh, no, I always forget to wear deodorant and dance with my boss in a room full of people I work with in a dress with no back.\nWell, you look great, you smell great. But I could fire you if that would take the edge off.\nI don't think you could tie your shoes without me.\nI'd make it a week.\nA week, really? What's your social security number?\n\nFive...\n\"Five?\" You're missing just a couple of digits.\nRight, the other eight. Well, I have you for the other eight.\nEvening, JARVIS!\nWelcome home, sir...\n\"I am Iron Man\". You think you're the only superhero in the world? Mr. Stark, you've become part of a bigger universe. You just don't know it yet.\nWho the hell are you?\nNick Fury. Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.\nAh.\nI'm here to talk to you about the Avenger Initiative.\nPepper, uh, how big are your hands?\nWhat?\nHow big are your hands?\nI don't understand why...\nGet down here. I need you.\nMr. Stark! Christine Everheart, Vanity Fair magazine. Can I ask you a couple of questions?\nShe's cute.\nShe's alright.\nHi!\nHi.\nYeah. Okay, go.\nYou've been called the Da Vinci of our time. What do you say to that?\nAbsolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.\nAnd what do you say to your other nickname, the Merchant of Death?\nThat's not bad. Let me guess... Berkeley?\nBrown, actually.\nWell, Ms. Brown. It's an imperfect world, but it's the only one we got. I guarantee you the day weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace, I'll start making bricks and beams for baby hospitals.\nRehearse that much?\nEvery night in front of the mirror before bedtime.\nI can see that.\nI'd like to show you firsthand.\nAll I'm looking for is a straight answer.\nOK, here's a straight answer. My old man had a philosophy: peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy.\nThat's a great line, coming from a guy selling the sticks.\nMy father helped defeat Nazis. He worked on the Manhattan Project. A lot of people, including your professors at Brown, would call that being a hero.\nAnd a lot of people would also call that war-profiteering.\nTell me, do you plan to report on the millions we've saved by advancing medical technology or kept from starvation with our intelli-crops? All those breakthroughs, military funding, honey.\nHave you ever lost an hour of sleep in your life?\nI'm be prepared to lose a few with you.\nThey say that the best weapon is the one you never have to fire. I respectfully disagree. I prefer the weapon you only have to fire once. That's how Dad did it, that's how America does it, and it's worked out pretty well so far. I present to you the newest in Stark Industries' Freedom line. Find an excuse to let one of these off the chain, and I personally guarantee, the bad guys won't even wanna come out of their caves. Ladies and gentlemen, for your consideration... the Jericho.\nWhat are you trying to get rid of me for? You got plans?\nAs a matter of fact, I do.\nI don't like it when you have plans.\nI'm allowed to have plans on my birthday.\nIt's your birthday?\nYes.\nI knew that. Already?\nYeah, isn't that strange? It's the same day as last year.\nWell, get yourself something nice for me.\nI already did.\nYeah? And?\nOh, it's very nice... very tasteful. Thank you, Mr. Stark.\nYou're welcome, Ms. Potts.\nOh, my God, you crazy son of a bitch! You owe me a plane, you know that, right?\nYeah, well, technically he hit me, so...\nHmmm. Your eyes are red. Tears for your long lost boss?\nTears of joy. I hate job hunting.\nYeah, well, vacation's over.\nI feel like you're driving me to court martial. This is crazy. What did I do? I feel like you're gonna pull over and snuff me. What, you're not allowed to talk? Hey, Forrest!\nWe can talk, sir.\nOh, I see. So it's personal.\nNo, you intimidate them.\nGood God, you're a woman! I honestly, I couldn't have called that. I mean, I would apologize, but isn't that what we're going for here? I thought of you as a soldier first.\nI'm an airman.\nWell, you have actually excellent bone structure there. I'm kinda having a hard time not looking at you now.

Now, just gently pull that out, and whatever you do, don't pull out the...\nThe magnet at the end of it. See, that was it. You just...\nWhat?\nWhat I was trying to tell you - no, don't put it back in! Just put it over there, we have to hurry...\nWhat's wrong?\nOh, nothing, I'm just going into cardiac arrest, because you...\n*What*? I thought you said this was safe!\n...just yanked it out like a trout!\nDon't ever, ever, ever, ask me to do anything like that, ever again!\nI don't have anyone but you.\nWe met, you know, in a technical conference in Bern.\nI don't remember.\nOf course not.

She'd be a wreck. She'd always be worrying I was going to die, yet so proud of the man I've become. She'd be wildly conflicted, which would only make her more crazy about me...\nOkay, let's do this right. Start mark, half a meter and to the right. Dummy, look alive, you're on standby for fire safety. You, roll it. Activate hand controls... okay, we're gonna start off nice and easy. See if 10% thrust capacity achieves lift.

EWW, there's pus!\nIt's not pus. It's an inorganic plasmic discharge. It's from the device, not my body.\nIt smells!\nYeah, it does.\nWell, Tony Stark!\nOh, hey.\nFancy seeing you here.\nCarrie.\nChristine.\nThat's right.\nYou have a lot of nerve showing up here tonight. Can I at least get a reaction from you?\nPanic. I would say panic is my reaction.\nI was referring to your company's involvement in this latest atrocity.\nYeah, they just put my name on the invitation, I don't know what to tell you.\nTony, you have to go to the hospital. The doctor has to look at you.\nI don't have to do anything. I've been in captivity for three months. There are two things I want to do. One, I want an American cheeseburger, and the other...\nThat's enough of that.\nIt's not what you think. I want you to call for a press conference.\nCall for a press conference? What on earth for?\nHogan, drive. Cheeseburger first.\nOkay, this is where I don't want to be.\nNot bad.\nLooking great, Hef.\nWhy aren't you wearing those pajamas I got you?\nGood night, Tony...\nIs it true that you went twelve-for-twelve with the Maxim Girls last year?\nThat is an excellent question. Yes and no. March and I had a scheduling conflict but fortunately the Christmas cover was twins.\nWhatcha readin'... platypus?\nNothin'.\nCome on sour patch.\nI told you I'm not sour...\n...don't be mad...\n...i'm not mad, i'm indifferent, ok.\nI said I was sorry.\nYou don't need to apologize to me cause I'm not mad.\nGood morning Mr. Stark.\nHi, I said I was sorry.\n...i'm just indifferent right now.\nHot towel?\nYou don't respect yourself so I know you don't respect me...\n...I respect you...\n...so I'm just your baby sitter. so when you need your diaper changed\nthank you\nlet me know and I'll get you a bottle, ok?\nHey! Heat up the saki will ya? Thanks for reminding me.\nI'm not talkin about a... we're not drinking we're working right now.\nYou are institutionally incapable of being responsible.\nIt would be irresponsible NOT to drink. I'm just talking about a night cap here.\nHot saki?\nYes, 2 please.\nNo... just... I'm not drinking. I don't want any.\nThat's what I'm talking about, when I get up in the morning and I'm puttin on my uniform you know what I recognize? I see in the mirror that every person with this uniform on, GOT MY BACK!\nyou know, i'm not... i'm not... like you... aren't you just a little distracted right now?\nyou don't have to be like me, but you can be more and you just don't see it. No I can't be distracted right now!\nAttitude control is a little sluggish above 15,000 meters, I'm guessing icing is the probable cause.\nA very astute observation, sir. Perhaps, if you intend to visit other planets, we should improve the exosystems.\nConnect to the sys. co. Have it reconfigure the shell metals. Use the gold titanium alloy from the seraphim tactical satellite. That should ensure a fuselage integrity while while maintaining power-to-weight ratio. Got it?\nSheesh o besh.\nGood roll.\nWe're gonna let it ride! Give me a hand, will you? Give me a little something-something.\nOkay, you too.\nI don't blow on a man's dice.\nCome on, honey bear.\nThere it is. Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes rolls! And...\nTwo craps. Line away.\nThat's what happens.\nWorse things have happened.\nI thought I lost you back there!\nYou did, sir.\nI would like a vodka martini, please.\nOkay.\nVery dry, with olives, a lot of olives. Like, at least three olives.\nTwo vodka martinis, extra dry, extra olives, extra... fast.\nHow'd it go?\nOh, that bad, huh?\nJust because I brought pizza back from New York doesn't mean it went bad.\nI got stuck doing a piece for Vanity Fair.\nGimme a gun! Gimme a gun!\nOkay, let's see what this thing can do. What's SR-71's record?\nThe altitude record for fixed wing flight is 85,000 feet, sir.\nRecords are made to be broken! Come on!\nI think you got a lot of my weapons. \n\nGiven quotes from the character above, which of the following tropes would you say this character represents?\n\nA: Absent Minded Professor\nB: Adventurer Archaeologist\nC: Arrogant Kungfu Guy\nD: Big Man On Campus\nE: Bounty Hunter\nF: Brainless Beauty\nG: Broken Bird\nH: Bromantic Foil\nI: Bruiser With A Soft Center\nJ: Bully\nK: Byronic Hero\nL: Casanova\nM: Chanteuse\nN: Charmer\nO: Child Prodigy\nP: Classy Cat Burglar\nQ: Consummate Professional\nR: Corrupt Corporate Executive\nS: Coward\nT: Crazy Jealous Guy\nU: Crazy Survivalist\nV: Cultured Badass\nW: Dean Bitterman\nX: Dirty Cop\nY: Ditz\nZ: Doormat\nAA: Drill Sargeant Nasty\nAB: Dumb Blonde\nAC: Dumb Muscle\nAD: Eccentric Mentor\nAE: Egomaniac Hunter\nAF: Evil Prince\nAG: Fastest Gun In The West\nAH: Father To His Men\nAI: Final Girl\nAJ: Gadgeteer Genius\nAK: Gentleman Thief\nAL: Granola Person\nAM: Grumpy Old Man\nAN: Hardboiled Detective\nAO: Heartbroken Badass\nAP: Henpecked Husband\nAQ: Hitman With A Heart\nAR: Jerk Jock\nAS: Junkie Prophet\nAT: Klutz\nAU: Loser Protagonist\nAV: Loveable Rogue\nAW: Master Swordsman\nAX: Morally Bankrupt Banker\nAY: Officer And A Gentleman\nAZ: Ophelia\nBA: Playful Hacker\nBB: Prima Donna\nBC: Psycho For Hire\nBD: Pupil Turned To Evil\nBE: Retired Outlaw\nBF: Revenge\nBG: Romantic Runnerup\nBH: Self Made Man\nBI: Slacker\nBJ: Stoner\nBK: Storyteller\nBL: Stupid Crooks\nBM: Surfer Dude\nBN: The Chief\nBO: The Editor\nBP: Tranquil Fury\nBQ: Trickster\nBR: Valley Girl\nBS: Warrior Poet\nBT: Young Gun\n",
    "16": "How feel you?\nCold, sir.\nAfraid are you?\nNo, sir.\nSee through you we can.\nBe mindful of your feelings.\nYour thoughts dwell on your mother.\nI miss her.\nAfraid to lose her I think, hmm?\nWhat has that got to do with anything?\nEverything! Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering. I sense much fear in you.\nYou're a Jedi Knight, aren't you?\nWhat makes you think that?\nI saw your laser sword. Only Jedi carry that kind of weapon.\nPerhaps I killed a Jedi and took it from him.\nI don't think so. No one can kill a Jedi.\nI wish that were so.\nMom, you said that the biggest problem in the universe is no one helps each other.\nI can't do it, Mom. I just can't do it.\nAni...\nWill I ever see you again?\nWhat does your heart tell you?\nI hope so. Yes... I guess.\nThen we will see each other again.\nI will come back and free you, Mom. I promise.\nNow, be brave, and don't look back. Don't look back.\nAre you an angel?\nWhat?\nAn angel. I've heard the deep space pilots talk about them. They live on the moons of Iego, I think. They're the most beautiful creatures in the universe.\nYou're a funny little boy. How do you know so much?\nI listen to all the traders and star pilots who come through here. I'm a pilot, you know, and someday I'm going to fly away from this place.\nYou're a slave?\nI'm a person and my name is Anakin.\nAll slaves have a transmitter placed somewhere in their body.\nI've been working on a scanner to try and locate mine.\nAny attempt to escape...\nAnd they blow you up! BOOM!\nHow wude!\nBut what about mom? Is she free too? You're coming too, aren't you mom?\nI tried to free your mother Anni, but Watto wouldn't have it.\nSon, my place is here, my future is here. It is time for you to let go.\nNow this is pod racing!\nI've built a racer. It's the fastest ever! There's a big race tomorrow on Boonta Eve. You could enter my pod. It's all but finished...\nAnakin, Watto won't let you...\nWatto, doesn't know I've built it. You could make him think it was yours and you could get him to let me pilot it for you.\nI don't want you to race Anni, it's awful. I die every time Watto makes you do it.\nBut mom, I love it. The prize money would more than pay for the parts they need.\nYippee!\nWhat are midi-chlorians?\nMidi-chlorians are a microscopic life form that resides within all living cells.\nI know we're in trouble, just hang on!\nQui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit, and that's what I'm going to do!\nMom, you've always said the biggest problem in this Universe is that nobody helps each other.\nI don't know if I'll ever see her again, I wanted to say goodbye.\nWe will tell her for you. We are sure her heart goes with you.\nYou won't walk away from this one, you slave scum!\nDon't count on it, slimeball!\nYou're Bantha fodder!\nI will come back and free you mom, I promise.\nYou were the chosen one! It was said that you would destroy the Sith, not join them! Bring balance to the force... not leave it in darkness!\nI HATE YOU!\nYou were my brother, Anakin! I loved you!\nIt's over Anakin, I have the high ground.\nYou underestimate my power!\nDon't try it.\nRemember back to your early teachings. \"All who gain power are afraid to lose it.\" Even the Jedi.\nThe Jedi use their power for good.\nGood is a point of view, Anakin. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way, including their quest for greater power.\nThe Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inward, only about themselves.\nAnd the Jedi don't?\nThe Jedi are selfless... they only care about others.\nDid you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis \"the wise\"?\nNo.\nI thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith who lived many years ago. He was so powerful and so wise that he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.\nHe could do that? He could actually save people from death?\nThe dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.\nWhat happened to him?\nHe became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, and then one night, his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic that he could save others from death, but not himself.\nIs it possible to learn this power?\nNot from a Jedi.\nYou have allowed this dark lord to twist your mind, until now, until now you've become the very thing you swore to destroy.\nDon't lecture me, Obi-Wan! I see through the lies of the Jedi. I do not fear the dark side as you do. I have brought peace, freedom, justice, and security to my new Empire.\nYour new Empire?\nDon't make me kill you.\nAnakin, my allegiance is to the Republic, to democracy.\nIf you're not with me, then you're my enemy.\nOnly a Sith deals in absolutes.\nI will do what I must.\nYou will try.\nObi-Wan, may the force be with you.\nGoodbye old friend. May the force be with you.\nAnakin, I was so worried about you! Obi-Wan... told me terrible things!\nWhat things?\nHe said... you turned to the Dark Side. That you... killed Younglings!\nObi-Wan is trying to turn you against me.\nHe cares about us.\nUs?\nHe knows. He wants to help you. Anakin, all I want is your love.\nLove won't save you, Padme. Only my new powers can do that!\nBut at what cost? You're a good person, don't do this!\nI won't lose you the way I lost my mother. I am becoming more powerful than any Jedi has ever dreamed of, and I'm doing it for you. To protect you.\nCome away with me. Help me raise our child far away. Leave everything else behind while we still can!\nNo. Don't you see? We don't have to run away anymore! We no longer have to hide our love for each other. I am more powerful than the Chancellor, I... I can overthrow him! And together, you and I can rule the galaxy! We can make things the way we want them to be!\nI don't believe what I'm hearing! Obi-Wan was right... you've changed! You have turned to the dark side! You're not Anakin anymore!\nI don't want to hear any more about Obi-Wan. The Jedi turned against me. Don't you turn against me!\nAnakin, you're breaking my heart! You're going down a path I cannot follow!\nBecause of Obi-Wan?\nBecause of what you've done... what you plan to do! Stop! Stop now... come back... I love you!\nLiar! You're with him! You brought him here to kill me!\nYou turned her against me!\nYou have done that yourself.\nYou will not take her from me!\nYour anger and lust for power have already done that.\nWhat have I done?\nYou are fulfilling your destiny, Anakin. Become my apprentice. Learn to use the dark side of the Force. There's no turning back now.\nI will do whatever you ask. Just help me save Padme's life. I can't live without her. If she dies, I don't know what I will do.\nTo cheat death is a power only one has achieved through centuries of the study of the Force. But if we work together, I know we can discover the secret to eternal life\nI pledge myself to your teachings. To the ways of the Sith.\nGood. Good! The Force is strong with you, Anakin Skywalker. A powerful Sith you will become. Henceforth, you shall be known as Darth... Vader.\nThank you... my Master.\nLord Vader... rise.\nPremonitions, premonitions. These visions you have...\nThey are of pain, suffering. Death.\nYourself you speak of, or someone you know?\nSomeone.\nClose to you?\nYes.\nCareful you must be when sensing the future Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.\nI won't let these visions come true, Master Yoda.\nDeath is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them do not. Miss them do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed that is.\nWhat must I do, Master Yoda?\nTrain yourself to let go... of everything you fear to lose.\nMaster Windu, I must speak with you.\nNot now, Skywalker. We have just received word that Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous. We're on our way to make sure the Chancellor returns emergency powers back to the Senate.\nHe won't give up his power. I just learned the terrible truth. I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith Lord.\nA Sith Lord?\nYes, the one we've been looking for.\nHow do you know this?\nHe knows the ways of the Force. He's been trained to use the Dark Side.\nAre you sure?\nAbsolutely.\nThen our worst fears have been realized. We must move quickly if the Jedi Order is to survive.\nWhat was that all about?\nWell, R2 has been...\nNo loose wire jokes.\nDid I say anything?\nHe's trying.\nI didn't say anything.\nI have failed you, Anakin. I have failed you.\nI should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over!\nAnakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil!\nFrom my point of view, the Jedi are evil!\nWell, then you are lost!\nThis is the end for you, my master.\nLove won't save you, Padme. Only my new powers can do that.\nI know what's been troubling you. Listen to me. Don't continue to a be a pawn of the Jedi Council! Ever since I've known you, you have been seeking a life of great significance, far more than any Jedi.\nAre you going to kill me?\nI would certainly like to!\nI know you would. I can feel your anger. It give you focus... makes you stronger.\nI'm not going to die in childbirth, Anakin. I promise you.\nNo, I promise you.\nUh-oh.\nWe lost something.\nNot to worry. We're still flying half a ship.\nAnakin Skywalker. I expected someone with your reputation to be a little... older.\nGeneral Grievous... you're shorter than I expected.\nJedi scum!\nWe have a job to do, Anakin. Try not to upset him.\nI'm going to put an end to this, once and for all!\nYou can't. He must stand trial.\nHe has control of the senate and all the courts. He is too dangerous to be left alive!\nBut, I'm too weak. Don't kill me.\nThat's not the Jedi way. He must live.\nI need him!\nNO!\nPower, unlimited power!\nGood, Anakin, good. Kill him.\nKill him now.\nI shouldn't...\nDo it!\nI couldn't stop myself.\nYou did well, Anakin. He was too dangerous to be kept alive.\nYes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.\nI shouldn't have done that. It's not the Jedi way.\nIt is only natural. He cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge. It wasn't the first time, Anakin. Remember what you told me about your mother and the Sand People.\nNow, we must leave before more security droids arrive.\nAre you all right? You're trembling. What's going on?\nSomething wonderful has happened. Ani, I'm pregnant.\nYou are so... beautiful.\nIt's only because I'm so in love.\nNo, it's because I'm so in love with you.\nSo love has blinded you?\nWell, that's not exactly what I meant.\nBut it's probably true.\nI sense Count Dooku.\nI sense a trap.\nNext move?\nSpring the trap.\nBe careful of the Jedi, Anakin. Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi. Learn to use the Dark Side of the Force and you will be able to save your wife from certain death.\nWhat did you say? How do you know that...?\nUse my knowledge, I beg you.\nYou're the Sith Lord!\nThis is where the fun begins.\nI swear to you... I didn't ask to be put on the council.\nBut it's what you wanted. Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off. Anakin, I am on your side. I did not want to put you in this situation\nWhat situation?\nThe Council wants you to report on all the Chancellor's dealings.\nThey want me to spy on the Chancellor? But that is treason!\nWe are at war, Anakin.\nAnakin, let's be fair. Today you were the hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians.\nAll right. But you owe me one, and for not saving your skin for the tenth time.\n*Ninth* time. That business on Cato Neimodia doesn't- doesn't count.\nI hope you trust me, Anakin.\nOf course.\nI need your help, son. I want you to be the eyes, ears, and voice of the Republic. Anakin, I'm appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council.\nMe? A Master? I'm overwhelmed, sir. But the Council elects its own members. They will never accept this.\nI think they will. They need you, more than you know.\nI'm going there to end this war. Wait for me until I return. Thing's will be different, I promise. Please wait for me.\nThe Separatists have been taken care of, my master.\nIt is finished then. You have restored peace and justice to the galaxy.\nEasy! We're in a bit of a situation.\nDid I miss something?\nI missed you, Padmé.\nI feel lost.\nLost?\nObi-Wan and the Council don't trust me.\nThey trust you with their lives.\nSomething's happening. I'm not the Jedi I should be. I want more. And I know I shouldn't.\nRay shields.\nWait a minute. How did this happen? We're smarter than this.\nApparently not. I say patience.\nPatience?\nYes. R2 will be along in a few moments and then... he'll release us from the ray shields.\nSee? No problem.\nAllow this appointment lightly, the council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.\nI understand.\nYou are on the council, but we do not grant you the rank of master.\nWhat? How can you do this? This is outrageous, it's unfair.\nTake a seat, young Skywalker.\nForgive me master.\nYou brought him here to kill me!\nWait, Master. There is something I must know.\nIf into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find.\nI must know the truth, Master.\nIt can't be... It can't be...\nThe traitors have been taken care of, Lord Sidious.\nGood... Good... you have done well, my apprentice. Now Lord Vader, go and bring peace to the Empire.\nI can't watch any more.\nDestroy the Sith we must.\nLock on to him R2.\nMaster, General Grievous's ship is directly ahead. The one crawling with Vulture droids.\nOh, I see it. Oh, this is going to be easy.\nMy powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count.\nGood. Twice the pride, double the fall.\nFrom my point of view the Jedi are evil.\nThen you are lost!\nI'm going to turn you over to the Jedi.\nOf course you should. But you can't be sure of their intentions.\nI will learn the truth of all this quickly.\nYou have much wisdom, Anakin. But if I were to die, all the knowledge you seek about the true nature of the Force will be lost with me. Learn the power of the Dark Side, Anakin. The power to save Padmé.\nCan you fly a cruiser like this?\nYou mean, do I know how to land what's left of this thing?\nRoger...\nRoger.\nYou're going to need me on this one, Master.\nOh, I agree. Though it could turn out to just be a wild bantha chase.\nWe got 'em, R2.\nChancellor.\nYou all right?\nCount Dooku.\nThis time we'll do it together.\nI was about to say that.\nYou can't be any match for him, he's a Sith Lord.\nChancellor Palpatine, Sith Lords are our specialty.\nYour swords, please. You don't want to make a mess of things in front of the Chancellor.\nYou won't get away this time, Dooku.\nI've been looking forward to this.\nMy powers are double since the last time we met, Count.\nGood. Twice the pride, double the fall.\nGet him!\nYou were the chosen one! It was said that you would destroy the Sith, not join them! Bring balance to the force... not leave it in darkness!\nI HATE YOU!\nYou were my brother, Anakin! I loved you!\nIt's over Anakin, I have the high ground.\nYou underestimate my power!\nDon't try it.\nRemember back to your early teachings. \"All who gain power are afraid to lose it.\" Even the Jedi.\nThe Jedi use their power for good.\nGood is a point of view, Anakin.

Ani, I'm pregnant.\nYou are so... beautiful.\nIt's only because I'm so in love.\nNo, it's because I'm so in love with you.\nSo love has blinded you?\nWell, that's not exactly what I meant.\nBut it's probably true.\nI sense Count Dooku.\nI sense a trap.\nNext move?\nSpring the trap.\nBe careful of the Jedi, Anakin. Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi. Learn to use the Dark Side of the Force and you will be able to save your wife from certain death.\nWhat did you say? How do you know that...?\nUse my knowledge, I beg you.\nYou're the Sith Lord!\nThis is where the fun begins.\nI swear to you... I didn't ask to be put on the council.\nBut it's what you wanted. Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off. Anakin, I am on your side. I did not want to put you in this situation\nWhat situation?\nThe Council wants you to report on all the Chancellor's dealings.\nThey want me to spy on the Chancellor? But that is treason!\nWe are at war, Anakin.\nAnakin, let's be fair. Today you were the hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians.\nAll right. But you owe me one, and for not saving your skin for the tenth time.\n*Ninth* time. That business on Cato Neimodia doesn't- doesn't count.\nI hope you trust me, Anakin.\nOf course.\nI need your help, son. I want you to be the eyes, ears, and voice of the Republic. Anakin, I'm appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council.\nMe? A Master? I'm overwhelmed, sir. But the Council elects its own members. They will never accept this.\nI think they will. They need you, more than you know.\nI'm going there to end this war. Wait for me until I return. Thing's will be different, I promise. Please wait for me.\nThe Separatists have been taken care of, my master.\nIt is finished then. You have restored peace and justice to the galaxy.\nEasy! We're in a bit of a situation.\nDid I miss something?\nI missed you, Padmé.\nI feel lost.\nLost?\nObi-Wan and the Council don't trust me.\nThey trust you with their lives.\nSomething's happening. I'm not the Jedi I should be. I want more. And I know I shouldn't.\nRay shields.\nWait a minute. How did this happen? We're smarter than this.\nApparently not. I say patience.\nPatience?\nYes. R2 will be along in a few moments and then... he'll release us from the ray shields.\nSee? No problem.\nAllow this appointment lightly, the council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.\nI understand.\nYou are on the council, but we do not grant you the rank of master.\nWhat? How can you do this? This is outrageous, it's unfair.\nTake a seat, young Skywalker.\nForgive me master.\nYou brought him here to kill me!\nWait, Master. There is something I must know.\nIf into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find.\nI must know the truth, Master.\nIt can't be... It can't be...\nThe traitors have been taken care of, Lord Sidious.\nGood... Good... you have done well, my apprentice. Now Lord Vader, go and bring peace to the Empire.\nI can't watch any more.\nDestroy the Sith we must.\nLock on to him R2.\nMaster, General Grievous's ship is directly ahead. The one crawling with Vulture droids.\nOh, I see it. Oh, this is going to be easy.\nMy powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count.\nGood. Twice the pride, double the fall.\nFrom my point of view the Jedi are evil.\nThen you are lost!\nI'm going to turn you over to the Jedi.\nOf course you should. But you can't be sure of their intentions.\nI will learn the truth of all this quickly.\nYou have much wisdom, Anakin. But if I were to die, all the knowledge you seek about the true nature of the Force will be lost with me. Learn the power of the Dark Side, Anakin. The power to save Padmé.\nCan you fly a cruiser like this?\nYou mean, do I know how to land what's left of this thing?\nRoger...\nRoger.\nYou're going to need me on this one, Master.\nOh, I agree. Though it could turn out to just be a wild bantha chase.\nWe got 'em, R2.\nChancellor.\nYou all right?\nCount Dooku.\nThis time we'll do it together.\nI was about to say that.\nYou can't be any match for him, he's a Sith Lord.\nChancellor Palpatine, Sith Lords are our specialty.\nYour swords, please. You don't want to make a mess of things in front of the Chancellor.\nYou won't get away this time, Dooku.\nI've been looking forward to this.\nMy powers are double since the last time we met, Count.\nGood. Twice the pride, double the fall.\nGet him!\nHow feel you?\nCold, sir.\nAfraid are you?\nNo, sir.\nSee through you we can.\nBe mindful of your feelings.\nYour thoughts dwell on your mother.\nI miss her.\nAfraid to lose her I think, hmm?\nWhat has that got to do with anything?\nEverything! Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering. I sense much fear in you.\nYou're a Jedi Knight, aren't you?\nWhat makes you think that?\nI saw your laser sword. Only Jedi carry that kind of weapon.\nPerhaps I killed a Jedi and took it from him.\nI don't think so. No one can kill a Jedi.\nI wish that were so.\nMom, you said that the biggest problem in the universe is no one helps each other.\nI can't do it, Mom. I just can't do it.\nAni...\nWill I ever see you again?\nWhat does your heart tell you?\nI hope so. Yes... I guess.\nThen we will see each other again.\nI will come back and free you, Mom. I promise.\nNow, be brave, and don't look back. Don't look back.\nAre you an angel?\nWhat?\nAn angel. I've heard the deep space pilots talk about them. They live on the moons of Iego, I think. They're the most beautiful creatures in the universe.\nYou're a funny little boy. How do you know so much?\nI listen to all the traders and star pilots who come through here. I'm a pilot, you know, and someday I'm going to fly away from this place.\nYou're a slave?\nI'm a person and my name is Anakin.\nAll slaves have a transmitter placed somewhere in their body.\nI've been working on a scanner to try and locate mine.\nAny attempt to escape...\nAnd they blow you up! BOOM!\nHow wude!\nBut what about mom? Is she free too? You're coming too, aren't you mom?\nI tried to free your mother Anni, but Watto wouldn't have it.\nSon, my place is here, my future is here. It is time for you to let go.\nNow this is pod racing!\nI've built a racer. It's the fastest ever! There's a big race tomorrow on Boonta Eve. You could enter my pod. It's all but finished...\nAnakin, Watto won't let you...\nWatto, doesn't know I've built it. You could make him think it was yours and you could get him to let me pilot it for you.\nI don't want you to race Anni, it's awful. I die every time Watto makes you do it.\nBut mom, I love it. The prize money would more than pay for the parts they need.\nYippee!\nWhat are midi-chlorians?\nMidi-chlorians are a microscopic life form that resides within all living cells.\nI know we're in trouble, just hang on!\nQui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit, and that's what I'm going to do!\nMom, you've always said the biggest problem in this Universe is that nobody helps each other.\nI don't know if I'll ever see her again, I wanted to say goodbye.\nWe will tell her for you. We are sure her heart goes with you.\nYou won't walk away from this one, you slave scum!\nDon't count on it, slimeball!\nYou're Bantha fodder!\nI will come back and free you mom, I promise. \n\nGiven quotes from the character above, which of the following tropes would you say this character represents?\n\nA: Absent Minded Professor\nB: Adventurer Archaeologist\nC: Arrogant Kungfu Guy\nD: Big Man On Campus\nE: Bounty Hunter\nF: Brainless Beauty\nG: Broken Bird\nH: Bromantic Foil\nI: Bruiser With A Soft Center\nJ: Bully\nK: Byronic Hero\nL: Casanova\nM: Chanteuse\nN: Charmer\nO: Child Prodigy\nP: Classy Cat Burglar\nQ: Consummate Professional\nR: Corrupt Corporate Executive\nS: Coward\nT: Crazy Jealous Guy\nU: Crazy Survivalist\nV: Cultured Badass\nW: Dean Bitterman\nX: Dirty Cop\nY: Ditz\nZ: Doormat\nAA: Drill Sargeant Nasty\nAB: Dumb Blonde\nAC: Dumb Muscle\nAD: Eccentric Mentor\nAE: Egomaniac Hunter\nAF: Evil Prince\nAG: Fastest Gun In The West\nAH: Father To His Men\nAI: Final Girl\nAJ: Gadgeteer Genius\nAK: Gentleman Thief\nAL: Granola Person\nAM: Grumpy Old Man\nAN: Hardboiled Detective\nAO: Heartbroken Badass\nAP: Henpecked Husband\nAQ: Hitman With A Heart\nAR: Jerk Jock\nAS: Junkie Prophet\nAT: Klutz\nAU: Loser Protagonist\nAV: Loveable Rogue\nAW: Master Swordsman\nAX: Morally Bankrupt Banker\nAY: Officer And A Gentleman\nAZ: Ophelia\nBA: Playful Hacker\nBB: Prima Donna\nBC: Psycho For Hire\nBD: Pupil Turned To Evil\nBE: Retired Outlaw\nBF: Revenge\nBG: Romantic Runnerup\nBH: Self Made Man\nBI: Slacker\nBJ: Stoner\nBK: Storyteller\nBL: Stupid Crooks\nBM: Surfer Dude\nBN: The Chief\nBO: The Editor\nBP: Tranquil Fury\nBQ: Trickster\nBR: Valley Girl\nBS: Warrior Poet\nBT: Young Gun\n",
    "17": "My life's a disaster zone. I got a stepdaughter so fucked up because her real father's this large-type asshole. I got a wife, we're passing each other on the down-slope of a marriage - my third - because I spend all my time chasing guys like you around the block. That's my life.\nA guy told me one time, \"Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner.\" Now, if you're on me and you gotta move when I move, how do you expect to keep a... a marriage?\nWhat are you doing?\nWhat am I doing? I'm talking to an empty telephone.\nI don't understand.\n'Cause there is a dead man on the other end of this fuckin' line\nTold you I'm never going back...\nYeah.\nYou know, we are sitting here, you and I, like a couple of regular fellas. You do what you do, and I do what I gotta do. And now that we've been face to face, if I'm there and I gotta put you away, I won't like it. But I tell you, if it's between you and some poor bastard whose wife you're gonna turn into a widow, brother, you are going down.\nThere is a flip side to that coin. What if you do got me boxed in and I gotta put you down? Cause no matter what, you will not get in my way. We've been face to face, yeah. But I will not hesitate. Not for a second.\nYou travel a lot?\nYeah.\nTraveling makes you lonely?\nI'm alone, I am not lonely.\nSo you never wanted a regular type life?\nWhat the fuck is that? Barbeques and ballgames?\nI do what I do best, I take scores. You do what you do best, try to stop guys like me.\nWhat are you, a monk?\nI have a woman.\nWhat do you tell her?\nI tell her I'm a salesman.\nSo then, if you spot me coming around that corner... you just gonna walk out on this woman? Not say good bye?\nThat's the discipline.\nThat's pretty vacant, you know.\nYeah, it is what it is. It's that or we both better go do something else, pal.\nI don't know how to do anything else.\nNeither do I.\nI don't much want to either.\nNeither do I.\nSeven years in Folsom.

Gee, what, where the fuck did this heat come from?\nMaybe it's the score they were onto, the place, not us.

    "19": "What is the most resilient parasite? Bacteria? A virus? An intestinal worm? An idea. Resilient... highly contagious. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate. An idea that is fully formed - fully understood - that sticks; right in there somewhere.\nI need to get home. That's all I care about right now.\nWhy can't you go home?\nBecause they think I killed her.\n\nThank you.\nFor what?\nFor not asking whether I did.\nIt would have to be a 747.\nWhy is that?\nBecause in a 747, the pilot's up top, and the first class cabin's in the nose, so no one would walk through. But you'd have to buy out the entire cabin. And the first class flight attendant...\nI bought the airline.\nIt seemed neater.\nShe locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget.\nYou're waiting for a train. A train that'll take you far away. You know where you hope this train will take you. But you can't know for sure. Yet it doesn't matter. Now, tell me why?\nBecause you'll be together!\nWhy is it so important to dream?\nBecause, in my dreams we are together.\nDreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange.\nHave you come to kill me? I've been waiting for someone...\nSomeone from a half remembered dream.\nCobb? Impossible. We were young men together. I'm an old man.\nFilled with regret...\nWaiting to die alone...\nI've come back for you... to remind you of something. Something you once knew...\nThat this world is not real.\nTo convince me to honor our arrangement.\nTo take a leap of faith, yes. Come back... so we can be young men together again. Come back with me...\nCome back...\nWe'd be together forever. You promised me.\nI know. But we can't. And I'm sorry.\nYou remember when you asked me to marry you? You said you dreamt that we'd grow old together.\nBut we did. We did. You don't remember?... I miss you more than I can bear, but... we had our time together. And I have to let go... I have to let you go.\nI can't stay with her anymore because she doesn't exist.\nI'm the only thing you do believe in anymore.\nI wish. I wish more than anything. But I can't imagine you with all your complexity, all you perfection, all your imperfection. Look at you. You are just a shade of my real wife. You're the best I can do; but I'm sorry, you are just not good enough.\nThey say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything.\nInception. Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible...\nNo, it's perfectly possible. It's just bloody difficult.\nSo, once we've made the plant, how do we go out? Hope you have something more elegant in mind than shooting me in the head?\nA kick.\nWhat's a kick?\nThis, Ariadne, would be a kick\n\nI'm going to improvise. Listen, there's something you should know about me... about inception. An idea is like a virus, resilient, highly contagious. The smallest seed of an idea can grow. It can grow to define or destroy you.\nWhat do you want?\nInception. Is it possible?\nOf course not.\nIf you can steal an idea, why can't you plant one there instead?\nOkay, this is me, planting an idea in your mind. I say: don't think about elephants. What are you thinking about?\nElephants?\nRight, but it's not your idea. The dreamer can always remember the genesis of the idea. True inspiration is impossible to fake.\nNo, it's not.\nI'm asking you to take a leap of faith.\nNo I can't. You know I can't do that. Take a second, think about our children. Think about James. Think about Phillipa now.\nIf I go without you they'll take them away anyways.\nWhat does that mean?\nI filed a letter with our attourney explaining how I'm fearful for my safety. How you've threatened to kill me.\nWhy did you do that?\nI love you, Dom.\nWhy did you... why-why would you do that?\nI freed you from the guilt of choosing to leave them. We're going home to our real children.\nNo, no, no, no. Mal you listen to me, alright? Mal look at me, please.\nYou're waiting for a train...\nMal, goddammit! Don't do this!\nA train that will take you far away...\nJames and Phillipa are waiting!\nYou know where you hope this train will take you...\nThey're waiting for us!\nBut you can't know for sure...\nMal, look at me!\nYet it doesn't matter...\nMal, goddammit!\nBecause you'll be together.\nSweetheart! Look at me!\n\nMal, no! Jesus Christ!\n\"I will split up my father's empire.\" Now, this is obviously an idea that Robert himself would choose to reject. Which is why we need to plant it deep in his subconscious. Subconscious is motivated by emotion, right? Not reason. We need to find a way to translate this into an emotional concept.\nHow do you translate a business strategy into an emotion?\nThat's what we're here to figure out, right? Now, Robert's relationship with his father is stressed, to say the least.\nWell, can we run with that? We could suggest to him breaking up his father's company as a \"screw-you\" to the old man.\nNo, 'cause I think positive emotion trumps negative emotion every time. We all yearn for reconciliation, for catharsis. We need Robert Fischer to have a positive emotional reaction to all this.\nAlright, we'll try this, umm... \"My father accepts that I want to create for myself, not follow in his footsteps.\"\nThat might work.\nMight? We're gonna need to do a little better than 'might'.\nOh, thank you for your contribution, Arthur.\nForgive me for wanting a little specificity, Eames.\nSpecificity?\nThat price on my head, was that dead or alive?\nNot sure. See if he starts shooting.\nBrain function in the dream will be about twenty times to normal. When you enter a dream within that dream, the effect is compounded: it's three dreams, that's ten hours times twen...\nI'm sorry, uh, maths was never my strong subject. How much time is that?\nIt's a week the first level down. Six months the second level down, and... the third level...\n...is ten years! Who would wanna be stuck in a dream for ten years?\nDepends on the dream.\nYou create the world of the dream, you bring the subject into that dream, and they fill it with their subconscious.\nHow could I ever acquire enough detail to make them think that its reality?\nWell dreams, they feel real while we're in them, right? It's only when we wake up that we realize how things are actually strange. Let me ask you a question, you, you never really remember the beginning of a dream do you? You always wind up right in the middle of what's going on.\nI guess, yeah.\nSo how did we end up here?\nWell we just came from the a...\nThink about it Ariadne, how did you get here? Where are you right now?\nWe're dreaming?\nYou're actually in the middle of the workshop right now, sleeping. This is your first lesson in shared dreaming. Stay calm.\nWhy are they all looking at me?\nBecause my subconscious feels that someone else is creating this world. The more you change things, the quicker the projections start to converge on you.\nConverge?\nIt's the foreign nature of the dreamer. They attack like white blood cells fighting an infection.\nThey're going to attack us?\nNo. Just you.\nWhat about his security? It's gonna get worse as we go deeper.\nI think we run with Mr. Charles.\nNo.\nWho's Mr. Charles?\nBad idea.\nThe second we get in that hotel with Fischer, his security is gonna be all over us. We run with Mr. Charles like we did on the Stein job.\nSo you've done it before?\nYeah, and it didn't work. The subject realized he was dreaming and his subconscious tore us to pieces.\nExcellent. But you learned a lot, right?\nWhat are you doing here?\nMy name is...\nI know who you are. What are you doing here?\nI'm just trying to understand...\nHow could you understand? Do you know what it is to be a lover? To be half of a whole?\nNo...\nI'll tell you a riddle. You're waiting for a train. A train that will take you far away. You know where you hope this train will take you; but you don't know for sure. But it doesn't matter. How can it not matter to you where that train will take you?\nBecause you'll be together.\nShe had locked something away, something deep inside her. The truth that she had once known, but... she chose to forget. Limbo became her reality.\nWhat happened when you woke up?\nTo wake up from that after, after years, after decades... after we'd become old souls thrown back into youth like that... I knew something was wrong with her. She just wouldn't admit it. Eventually, she told me the truth. She was possessed by an idea, this one, very simple idea, that changed everything. That our world wasn't real. That she needed to wake up to come back to reality, that, in order to get back home, we had to kill ourselves.\nHow's he doing?\nHe's in a lot of pain.\nWhen we get down to the lower levels, the pain will be less intense.\nAnd if he dies?\nWorst case scenario? When he wakes up, his mind is completely gone.\nCobb. I'll still honor the arrangement.\nI appreciate that, Saito, but when you wake up, you won't even remember that we had an arrangement. Limbo's gonna become your reality. You're gonna be lost down there so long that you're gonna become an old man.\nFilled with regret.\nWaiting to die alone.\nNo. I'll come back. And we'll be young men together again.\nVery impressive.\nI know this bridge. This place is real, isn't it?\nYeah, I cross it everyday on the way to the college.\nNever recreate places from your memory. Always imagine new places.\nWell, you gotta draw from stuff you know, right?\nOnly use details, a street lamp or a phone booth, never entire areas.\nWhy not?\nBecause building a dream from your memory is the easiest way to lose your grasp on what's real and what is a dream.\nIs that what happened to you?\nHey listen to me. This has nothing to do with me. Understand?\nIs that why you need me to build your dreams?\nWhere were you? What happened to you?\nGot blocked by a freight train.\nWhy would you put a train course in the middle of a downtown intersection?\nWhy, I didn't.\nWhere did it come from?\nLet me ask you a question, why the hell were we ambushed, huh? Those were not normal projections. They've been trained, for God's sakes!\nYou're right.\nHow could they be trained?\nFischer's had an extractor teach his subconscious to defend itself, so, his subconscious has militarized. It should have shown in the research. I'm sorry.\nI think positive emotion trumps negative emotion every time.\nThese aren't just dreams. These are memories. And you said never to use memories.\nI know I did.\nYou're trying to keep her alive. You can't let her go.\nYou don't understand. These are moments I regret, the memories that I have to change.\nI knew Inception was possible because I'd done it to my wife.\nYou might have the rest of the team convinced to carry on with this job, but they don't know the truth.\nTruth? What truth?\nThe truth that at any minute, you might bring a freight train through the wall. The truth that Mal is bursting through your subconscious. And the truth that as we go deeper into Fischer, we're also going deeper into you. And... I'm not sure we're gonna like what we find.\nNever recreate from your memory. Always imagine new places!\nWon't you tell me anything about this first?\nBefore I describe the job I have to know you can do it.\nWhy?\nIt's not, strictly speaking, legal.\nYou keep telling yourself what you know. But what do you believe? What do you feel?\nGuilt.\nYou. What the hell was all that?\nI have it under control.\nI'd hate to see it out of control.\nYou create the world of the dream. We bring the subject into that dream and fill it with their subconscious.\nHow could I ever acquire enough detail to make them think that it's reality?\nWell, dreams, they feel real while we're in them right? Its only when we wake up then we realize that something was actually strange.\nThe moment's passed. Whatever I do I can't change this moment. I'm about to call out to them. They run away. If I'm ever going to see their faces I've gotta get back home. The real world.\nDownwards is the only way forwards.\nMr. Cobb has a job offer he would like to discuss with you.\nLike a work placement?\nNot exactly.\nCobb, I'm coming with you.\nI promised Miles...\nThe team needs someone who understands what you're struggling with. And it doesn't have to be me, but then you have to show Arthur what I just saw.\nGet us another seat on the plane.\nThere's no use threatening him in a dream, right, Mal?\nIt depends on what you're threatening. Killing him will just wake him up. But pain...\nPain is in the mind, and judging by the decor we're in your mind, aren't we, Arthur?\nI miss you more than I can bear, but we had our time together. I have to let you go.\nI came here to tell you... something.\nSomething that... you once knew to be true.\nImpossible...\nYou shouldn't be here.\nI just wanted to see what kind of tests you're doing on your own every night.\nThis has nothing to do with you.\nThis has everything to do with me. You've asked me to share dreams with you.\nNot these. These are my dreams.\nIf I get on this plane and you don't honor our agreement, when we land, I go to jail for the rest of my life.\nComplete the job en route. I make one phone call from the plane. You'll have no trouble getting through Immigration.\nAh. So, this is your idea of losing a tail, huh?\nDifferent tail.\nNo idea is simple when you have to plant it in someone else's mind.\nIf I jump, would I survive?\nA clean dive, perhaps. Mal, what are you doing here?\nI thought you might be missing me.\nYou know I am but I can't trust you anymore.\nSo what?\nYou promised! You promised!\nPlease, I just have to keep you here, just for now.\nYou said we'd be together! You said we'd grow old together!\nI'll come back, I promise.\nTell me, do the children miss me?\nYou can't imagine...\nWhy are they all looking at me?\nBecause my subconscious feels that someone else is creating this world. The more you change things, the quicker the projections start to converge on you.\nConverge?\nThey sense the foreign nature of the dreamer. they attack like white blood cells fighting an infection.\nWhat? They're going to attack us?\nNo, no.\nJust you.\nThis is great, but I'm telling you, if you keep changing things...\nI'm insured against kidnapping for up to 10 million. This should be very simple.\nShut up! It won't be.\nIn your father's office, below the bookshelves is his personal safe. We need the combination.\nI don't know any safe.\nThat doesn't mean you don't know the combination. Tell us what it is.\nI don't know.\nWe have it on good authority you do know.\nYeah? Whose authority?\nI'm just doing what you taught me.\nI never taught you to be a thief.\nI can access your mind through your dreams.\nYou're asking me for Inception. I hope you do understand the gravity of that request.\nHow are you, huh? How are you doing?\nOkay, I guess.\nWho's just okay? Is that you, James?\nYeah. Is Mommy with you?\nJames, we talked about this. Mommy's not here anymore.\nWhere?\nAnd you! You knew about this and went along with it!\nI trusted him!\nYou trusted him! What, when he promised you half his share?\nNo, his whole share. Besides he said he'd done it before.\nYou've done it before? What, with Mal? 'Cause that worked so good!\nThat has nothing to do with it. I did what I had to do to get back to my children.\nYou got the basic layout. Bookstore, cafe, almost everything else is here too.\nWho are the people?\nProjections of my subconscious.\nYours?\nYes. Remember, you are the dreamer, you build this world. I am the subject, my mind populates it. You can literally talk to my subconscious. That's one of the ways we extract information from the subject.\nHow else do you do it?\nBy creating something secure, like a bank vault or a jail. The mind automatically fills it with information it's trying to protect. Understand?\nThen you break in and steal it?\nWell...\nI guess I thought that the dream space would be all about the visual. But it's more about a feel of it. My question is what happens when you start messing with the physics of it all...?\nIt's something, isn't it?\nYes, it is.\nAll right, we continue on with the job, and we do it as fast as possible, and we get out using the kick, just like before.\nForget it. We go any deeper, we just raise the stakes. I am sitting this one out on this level, boys.\nAn idea is like a virus. Resilient. Highly contagious. And even the smallest seed of an idea can grow. It can grow to define or destroy you.\nYou're infecting my mind!\nI was trying to save you.\nYou betrayed me, but you can still make amends. You can still keep your promise. We can still be together, right here. In the world we built together.\nThe seed that we planted in this man's mind may change everything.\nI know how to find secrets from your Mind, I know all the tricks!\nI don't like trains.\nDreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange.\nShe locked away a secret, deep inside herself: a truth that she once knew... but chose to forget.\nMust have blown you off. That is unless her phone number really is only six digits. Funny way to make friends, someone stealing your wallet like that.\nThere's something you should know about me. About inception.\nYou're asking me for inception. I do hope you understand the gravity of that request.\nDownward is the only way forward.\nNever recreate places from your memories, always imagine new places. Only use details. A street lamp or a phone booth. Never entire areas. Building a dream from your memory is the easiest way of losing your grasp on what's real and what is a dream.\nStrange weather. Isn't it?\nYeah. Well, I don't like trains.\nWhat is the most resilient parasite? Bacteria? A virus? An intestinal worm? An idea. Resilient... highly contagious. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate. An idea that is fully formed - fully understood - that sticks; right in there somewhere.\nI need to get home. That's all I care about right now.\nWhy can't you go home?\nBecause they think I killed her.\n\nThank you.\nFor what?\nFor not asking whether I did.\nIt would have to be a 747.\nWhy is that?\nBecause in a 747, the pilot's up top, and the first class cabin's in the nose, so no one would walk through.

Limbo became her reality.\nWhat happened when you woke up?\nTo wake up from that after, after years, after decades... after we'd become old souls thrown back into youth like that... I knew something was wrong with her. She just wouldn't admit it. Eventually, she told me the truth. She was possessed by an idea, this one, very simple idea, that changed everything. That our world wasn't real. That she needed to wake up to come back to reality, that, in order to get back home, we had to kill ourselves.\nHow's he doing?\nHe's in a lot of pain.\nWhen we get down to the lower levels, the pain will be less intense.\nAnd if he dies?\nWorst case scenario? When he wakes up, his mind is completely gone.\nCobb. I'll still honor the arrangement.\nI appreciate that, Saito, but when you wake up, you won't even remember that we had an arrangement. Limbo's gonna become your reality. You're gonna be lost down there so long that you're gonna become an old man.\nFilled with regret.\nWaiting to die alone.\nNo. I'll come back. And we'll be young men together again.\nVery impressive.\nI know this bridge. This place is real, isn't it?\nYeah, I cross it everyday on the way to the college.\nNever recreate places from your memory. Always imagine new places.\nWell, you gotta draw from stuff you know, right?\nOnly use details, a street lamp or a phone booth, never entire areas.\nWhy not?\nBecause building a dream from your memory is the easiest way to lose your grasp on what's real and what is a dream.\nIs that what happened to you?\nHey listen to me. This has nothing to do with me. Understand?\nIs that why you need me to build your dreams?\nWhere were you? What happened to you?\nGot blocked by a freight train.\nWhy would you put a train course in the middle of a downtown intersection?\nWhy, I didn't.\nWhere did it come from?\nLet me ask you a question, why the hell were we ambushed, huh? Those were not normal projections. They've been trained, for God's sakes!\nYou're right.\nHow could they be trained?\nFischer's had an extractor teach his subconscious to defend itself, so, his subconscious has militarized. It should have shown in the research. I'm sorry.\nI think positive emotion trumps negative emotion every time.\nThese aren't just dreams. These are memories. And you said never to use memories.\nI know I did.\nYou're trying to keep her alive. You can't let her go.\nYou don't understand. These are moments I regret, the memories that I have to change.\nI knew Inception was possible because I'd done it to my wife.\nYou might have the rest of the team convinced to carry on with this job, but they don't know the truth.\nTruth? What truth?\nThe truth that at any minute, you might bring a freight train through the wall. The truth that Mal is bursting through your subconscious. And the truth that as we go deeper into Fischer, we're also going deeper into you. And... I'm not sure we're gonna like what we find.\nNever recreate from your memory. Always imagine new places!\nWon't you tell me anything about this first?\nBefore I describe the job I have to know you can do it.\nWhy?\nIt's not, strictly speaking, legal.\nYou keep telling yourself what you know. But what do you believe? What do you feel?\nGuilt.\nYou. What the hell was all that?\nI have it under control.\nI'd hate to see it out of control.\nYou create the world of the dream. We bring the subject into that dream and fill it with their subconscious.\nHow could I ever acquire enough detail to make them think that it's reality?\nWell, dreams, they feel real while we're in them right? Its only when we wake up then we realize that something was actually strange.\nThe moment's passed. Whatever I do I can't change this moment. I'm about to call out to them. They run away. If I'm ever going to see their faces I've gotta get back home. The real world.\nDownwards is the only way forwards.\nMr. Cobb has a job offer he would like to discuss with you.\nLike a work placement?\nNot exactly.\nCobb, I'm coming with you.\nI promised Miles...\nThe team needs someone who understands what you're struggling with. And it doesn't have to be me, but then you have to show Arthur what I just saw.\nGet us another seat on the plane.\nThere's no use threatening him in a dream, right, Mal?\nIt depends on what you're threatening. Killing him will just wake him up. But pain...\nPain is in the mind, and judging by the decor we're in your mind, aren't we, Arthur?\nI miss you more than I can bear, but we had our time together. I have to let you go.\nI came here to tell you... something.\nSomething that... you once knew to be true.\nImpossible...\nYou shouldn't be here.\nI just wanted to see what kind of tests you're doing on your own every night.\nThis has nothing to do with you.\nThis has everything to do with me. You've asked me to share dreams with you.\nNot these. These are my dreams.\nIf I get on this plane and you don't honor our agreement, when we land, I go to jail for the rest of my life.\nComplete the job en route. I make one phone call from the plane. You'll have no trouble getting through Immigration.\nAh. So, this is your idea of losing a tail, huh?\nDifferent tail.\nNo idea is simple when you have to plant it in someone else's mind.\nIf I jump, would I survive?\nA clean dive, perhaps. Mal, what are you doing here?\nI thought you might be missing me.\nYou know I am but I can't trust you anymore.\nSo what?\nYou promised! You promised!\nPlease, I just have to keep you here, just for now.\nYou said we'd be together! You said we'd grow old together!\nI'll come back, I promise.\nTell me, do the children miss me?\nYou can't imagine...\nWhy are they all looking at me?\nBecause my subconscious feels that someone else is creating this world. The more you change things, the quicker the projections start to converge on you.\nConverge?\nThey sense the foreign nature of the dreamer. they attack like white blood cells fighting an infection.\nWhat? They're going to attack us?\nNo, no.\nJust you.\nThis is great, but I'm telling you, if you keep changing things...\nI'm insured against kidnapping for up to 10 million. This should be very simple.\nShut up! It won't be.\nIn your father's office, below the bookshelves is his personal safe. We need the combination.\nI don't know any safe.\nThat doesn't mean you don't know the combination. Tell us what it is.\nI don't know.\nWe have it on good authority you do know.\nYeah? Whose authority?\nI'm just doing what you taught me.\nI never taught you to be a thief.\nI can access your mind through your dreams.\nYou're asking me for Inception. I hope you do understand the gravity of that request.\nHow are you, huh? How are you doing?\nOkay, I guess.\nWho's just okay? Is that you, James?\nYeah. Is Mommy with you?\nJames, we talked about this. Mommy's not here anymore.\nWhere?\nAnd you! You knew about this and went along with it!\nI trusted him!\nYou trusted him! What, when he promised you half his share?\nNo, his whole share. Besides he said he'd done it before.\nYou've done it before? What, with Mal? 'Cause that worked so good!\nThat has nothing to do with it. I did what I had to do to get back to my children.\nYou got the basic layout. Bookstore, cafe, almost everything else is here too.\nWho are the people?\nProjections of my subconscious.\nYours?\nYes. Remember, you are the dreamer, you build this world. I am the subject, my mind populates it. You can literally talk to my subconscious. That's one of the ways we extract information from the subject.\nHow else do you do it?\nBy creating something secure, like a bank vault or a jail. The mind automatically fills it with information it's trying to protect. Understand?\nThen you break in and steal it?\nWell...\nI guess I thought that the dream space would be all about the visual. But it's more about a feel of it. My question is what happens when you start messing with the physics of it all...?\nIt's something, isn't it?\nYes, it is.\nAll right, we continue on with the job, and we do it as fast as possible, and we get out using the kick, just like before.\nForget it. We go any deeper, we just raise the stakes. I am sitting this one out on this level, boys.\nAn idea is like a virus. Resilient. Highly contagious. And even the smallest seed of an idea can grow. It can grow to define or destroy you.\nYou're infecting my mind!\nI was trying to save you.\nYou betrayed me, but you can still make amends. You can still keep your promise. We can still be together, right here. In the world we built together.\nThe seed that we planted in this man's mind may change everything.\nI know how to find secrets from your Mind, I know all the tricks!\nI don't like trains.\nDreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange.\nShe locked away a secret, deep inside herself: a truth that she once knew... but chose to forget.\nMust have blown you off. That is unless her phone number really is only six digits. Funny way to make friends, someone stealing your wallet like that.\nThere's something you should know about me. About inception.\nYou're asking me for inception. I do hope you understand the gravity of that request.\nDownward is the only way forward.\nNever recreate places from your memories, always imagine new places. Only use details. A street lamp or a phone booth. Never entire areas. Building a dream from your memory is the easiest way of losing your grasp on what's real and what is a dream.\nStrange weather. Isn't it?\nYeah. Well, I don't like trains. \n\nGiven quotes from the character above, which of the following tropes would you say this character represents?\n\nA: Absent Minded Professor\nB: Adventurer Archaeologist\nC: Arrogant Kungfu Guy\nD: Big Man On Campus\nE: Bounty Hunter\nF: Brainless Beauty\nG: Broken Bird\nH: Bromantic Foil\nI: Bruiser With A Soft Center\nJ: Bully\nK: Byronic Hero\nL: Casanova\nM: Chanteuse\nN: Charmer\nO: Child Prodigy\nP: Classy Cat Burglar\nQ: Consummate Professional\nR: Corrupt Corporate Executive\nS: Coward\nT: Crazy Jealous Guy\nU: Crazy Survivalist\nV: Cultured Badass\nW: Dean Bitterman\nX: Dirty Cop\nY: Ditz\nZ: Doormat\nAA: Drill Sargeant Nasty\nAB: Dumb Blonde\nAC: Dumb Muscle\nAD: Eccentric Mentor\nAE: Egomaniac Hunter\nAF: Evil Prince\nAG: Fastest Gun In The West\nAH: Father To His Men\nAI: Final Girl\nAJ: Gadgeteer Genius\nAK: Gentleman Thief\nAL: Granola Person\nAM: Grumpy Old Man\nAN: Hardboiled Detective\nAO: Heartbroken Badass\nAP: Henpecked Husband\nAQ: Hitman With A Heart\nAR: Jerk Jock\nAS: Junkie Prophet\nAT: Klutz\nAU: Loser Protagonist\nAV: Loveable Rogue\nAW: Master Swordsman\nAX: Morally Bankrupt Banker\nAY: Officer And A Gentleman\nAZ: Ophelia\nBA: Playful Hacker\nBB: Prima Donna\nBC: Psycho For Hire\nBD: Pupil Turned To Evil\nBE: Retired Outlaw\nBF: Revenge\nBG: Romantic Runnerup\nBH: Self Made Man\nBI: Slacker\nBJ: Stoner\nBK: Storyteller\nBL: Stupid Crooks\nBM: Surfer Dude\nBN: The Chief\nBO: The Editor\nBP: Tranquil Fury\nBQ: Trickster\nBR: Valley Girl\nBS: Warrior Poet\nBT: Young Gun\n",

You got it?\nI said you got it?\nI was counting to three!\nNot that slowly! We don't what him to think you're retarded!\nWhat are you girls doing?\nDestroying a man.\nWho Do I Make My Check Out to?\nYour mom is SO HOT!\nSo I talked to John. He was sweet. He felt bad for you. He said that you were jealous because we share something special. Something that we don't have to label because...\nBecause it's our unspoken bond and I just love how secure you are?\nAnd it hurts me to question it, because...\n, , :\n\n... YOU'RE THE ONLY GIRL FOR ME?\n, , :\n\n... YOU'RE THE ONLY GIRL FOR ME?\n, , :\n\n... YOU'RE THE ONLY GIRL FOR ME?\nDamn! He said the same thing to all of us!\nFigures. He makes up with us and he hooks up with us...\nYou guys hooked up?\nJohn and I share something special.\nOh what, that they been both in your pants?\nWe share a vegan/nonviolent outlook on life.\nHippie slut.\nOh nice, Heather. It's not like everyone doesn't know that little Miss Cheerleader brings it on.\nWhat, you too?\nJohn and I belong together. He is the team captain and I am the head cheerleader.\nOh, I'm sorry, what kind of cheerleader?\nOh, like he'd take either of you two seriously?\nDo not lump me with her!\nOh so what, you're now better than me?\nShut up.\n, :\n\nWhat?\n, :\n\nWhat?\nSorry.\nYou got something to say?\nNo, it's none of my business.\nOkay, let me guess. Does he always use pet names like \"Baby\" and \"Sweetheart?\" Yeah, it's not out of affection, it's so he won't mix up your names. And he's all about an unspoken bond or something special, but never about a relationship. And the whole arrangement was your idea, so you feel guilty that he cheated.\nOh my God, you're dating John too?\nNo, I knew a guy like him... Skip.\nI was so depressed, I couldn't even enjoy the break-up sex.\nOh my god, I'm such a slut!\nIt's not even my date and he still gets me out of my skirt!\nJohn and I belong together. He's the varsity captain, and after all, I AM the head cheerleader.\nSorry what kind of cheerleader?\nFor you I don't have to give up all meat...\nYou know what, that was no accident!\nHe's mine!\nStay away from him!\nOh you little brat!\nGirls, peace and love! C'mon you guys are fighting over -...\nWe're fighting over John Tucker, he's mine!\nOH!\nWhat the hell is your problem?\nI am dating John Tucker.\nENOUGH! Let's get back in the game.\nDarn it Coach!\nJust let me get through. Just let me get them\nPUT THOSE BALLS DOWN!\nThis guy is cheating on all of you and instead of taking it out on him, you are beating the shit out of each other?\nLANGUAGE!\nDETENTION! You, you, you, and YOU! Honestly...\nWho is that?\nI don't know. Pam Something.\nJohn and I belong together. He's the varsity captain, and after all, I AM the head cheerleader.\nExcuse me, what kind of cheerleader did you say?\nI was so depressed I couldn't even enjoy the break-up sex.\nOh my God I am such a slut!\nI want to bring down you know who.\nNormally, I'm opposed to the slaughter of animals, but in John Tucker's case, I'll make an exception.\nI don't even know him.\nSo, you don't even know anyone. You're like the Swiss, you're neutered.\nUm, it's neutral. Kate, if the three of us tried this alone, we would kill each other. You brought us here. You showed us that we have something in common.\nExactly. We all want to kill John Tucker.\nWow. Okay.\nShe's right. I mean he always making me feel guilty.\nIt seems to me that if a guy treats you like that...\nYou'd break up with him, blah, blah, blah...\nEven John would have another girlfriend in a second.\nNo, I didn't say break up.

You shouldn't wait so long between hair cuts, you cheap son of a bitch.\nYeah. I'm surprised you're still around. I was always hoping you'd die off and they got someone in here that knew what the hell they were doing. Instead, you're just hanging around like the doo-wop dago you are.\nThat'll be ten bucks, Walt.\nTen bucks? Jesus Christ, Marty. What are you, half Jew or somethin'? You keep raising the damn prices all the time.\nIt's been ten bucks for the last five years, you hard-nosed Polack son of a bitch.\nYeah, well keep the change.\nSee you in three weeks, prick.\nNot if I see you first, dipshit.\nOh, I've got one. A Mexican, a Jew, and a colored guy go into a bar. The bartender looks up and says, \"Get the fuck out of here.\"\nI'll blow a hole in your face then go inside and sleep like a baby.\nGet off my lawn!\nWhat can I do for you Walt?\nI'm here for confession.\nHoly Jesus, what did you do?\nWhy didn't you call the police?\nWell you know, I prayed for them to come but nobody answered.\nI think you're an overeducated 27-year-old virgin who likes to hold the hands of superstitious old ladies and promise them everlasting life.\nNow you just gotta learn how guys talk. You just listen to the way Martin and I banter it back and forth. You OK? You're ready?\nSir!\nAlright let's go in...\nPerfect!

The Hmong people believe that the soul resides on the head, so don't do that.\nWell... Sounds dumb, but fine.\nYeah, and a lot of Hmong people consider looking someone in the eye to be very rude! That's why they look away when you look at them.\nYeah. Anything else?\nYeah... some Hmong people tend to smile or grin, when they're yelled at.

I shoulda blown his head off when I had the chance.\nYeah. Maybe so.\nAll right, here's the deal: you stay away from Thao, understand? You tell your friends to stay away from Thao.

    "22": "That's not the way to win.\nIs there a way to win?\nThere's a way to lose more slowly.\nI didn't know what I was doing. I, I didn't know anything except how much I hated him. But I didn't take anything. I didn't, Jeff. Don't you believe me?\nBaby, I don't care.\nShe can't be all bad. No one is.\nWell, she comes the closest.\nI don't want to die.\nNeither do I, baby, but if I have to, I'm going to die last.\nCan't you even feel sorry for me?\nI'm not going to try.\nJeff...\nJust get out, will you? I have to sleep in this room.\nI didn't know you were so little.\nI'm taller than Napoleon.\nYou're prettier, too.\nNice!\nAwfully cold around the heart.\nI sell gasoline, I make a small profit. With that I buy groceries. The grocer makes a profit. We call it earning a living. You may have heard of it somewhere.\nYou can never help anything, can you? You're like a leaf that the wind blows from one gutter to another.\nDon't you see you've only me to make deals with now?\nBuild my gallows high, baby.\nOh Jeff, you ought to have killed me for what I did a moment ago.\nThere's time.\nHow big a chump can you get to be? I was finding out.\nIt was the bottom of the barrel, and I was scraping it.\nWhy me?\nWell, I know a lot of smart guys, and a few honest ones. And you're both.\nDid you miss me?\nNo more than I would my eyes.\nNothing in the world is any good unless you can share it.\nYou know, maybe I was wrong and luck is like love. You have to go all the way to find it.\nYou do to keep it.\nI think we deserve a break.\nWe deserve each other.\nWell, the last guy in the world...\nI hate surprises myself. You wanna just shut the door and forget it?\nYou just sit and stay inside yourself. You wait for me to talk. I like that.\nI never found out much listening to myself.\nYour uh... cousin is a very charming young lady.\nNo he isn't. His name is Norman, and he's a bookmaker in Cleveland Ohio.\nLet's go down to the bar. We can cool off while we try to impress each other.\nYou are an idiot.\nSo's he.\nYou think so?\nWhy not? He's in love with you.\nYou say to yourself, \"How hot can it get?\" Then, in Acapulco, you find out.\nI never saw her in the daytime. We seemed to live by night. What was left of the day went away like a pack of cigarettes you smoked. I didn't know where she lived. I never followed her. All I ever had to go on was a place and time to see her again. I don't know what we were waiting for. Maybe we thought the world would end.\nNow, do you wanna talk business, or do you wanna play house...?\nThat evens us. Now fold your hands or I'll fold 'em for you!\nI'm sorry he didn't die.\nGive him time.\nIf it gets too lonely, there's a little cantina down the street called Pablo's. It's nice and quiet. The man there plays American music for a dollar. Sip bourbon and shut your eyes... it's like a little place on 56th Street.\nI'll wear my earrings.\nI sometimes go there.\nOh, Jeff. I've missed you. I've wondered about you and prayed you'd understand. Can you understand?\nYou prayed, Kathie?\nIf you'll drop this Junior League patter we may get the conversation down where it belongs.\nYou worried about something?\nI don't know. Should I be?\nNot if you do what you're told.\nThat's why I'm here. I do what I'm told. People trust me. Whit even trusts me twice. Do you?\nJust as far as I have to.\nI was expecting you.\nWell... I wasn't expecting you.\nShould I take that as a compliment?\nVery difficult girl.\nIs there one who is *not* so, Señor?\nYou don't know Whit. He won't forget.\nEverybody forgets.\nNot Whit.\nSo we'll send him a postcard every Christmas.\nJeff, I'm glad you're not afraid of him.\nI've been afraid of half the things I ever did.\nAnd this time?\nI'm only afraid you might not go.\nDon't be. I'll be there tomorrow.\nI like surprises. When I was a kid, we were so busted that if we got anything at all for Christmas it was a big surprise.\nWe got a call to come over and see a big Op.\nA what?\nAn operator. A gambler. He didn't come to see us because he was too high powered a character. Also because some dame had taken four shots at him with his own 38. Made one of 'em good.\nNear the Plaza was a little cafe called La Mar Azul, next to a movie house. I sat there in the afternoons and drank beer. I used to sit there half asleep with a beer in the darkness, only the music from the movie next door kept jarring me awake. And then I saw her - coming out of the sun. And I knew why Whit didn't care about that 40 grand.\nI could go down to the cliff and look at the sea like a good tourist. But, its no good if there isn't somebody you can turn to and say, \"Nice view there.\" Its the same with the churches, the relics, the moonlight or a Cuba Libre.\nI went to Pablo's that night. I knew I'd go every night until she showed up and I knew she knew it.\nShe waited until it was late. Then, she walked in out of the moonlight, smiling.\nYou know, you're a curious man.\nYou're going to make every guy you meet a little bit curious.\nIt's not what I mean.\nYou don't ask questions. You don't even ask me what my name is.\nAll right, what's your name.\nKathie.\nI like it.\nOr where I come from?\nI'm thinking about where we're going.\nI don't like playing games when I'm the fall guy. You might remember that, Whit.\nYou get your five grand back and Stephanos can take over from here.\nYou're wrong. I fire people but nobody quits me. You started this an you'll end it.\nI went alone to LA and I made it easy for him to follow me. He was a good gumshoe. It was the one thing he could really do.\nYou wanna lift, baby?\nYou know, I really hadn't ought.\nYou're a cute little package to be out walking alone at night.\nYou're kinda cute yourself.\nI can give you a tip. You tell Whit where we are, he might slip you a sawbuck.\nWell, I told you it wasn't a nice story.\nAnd I told you once that whatever happened was done.\nYeah, but you should have known about it long ago.\nIt's all right. I understand. But, it's all past.\nMaybe it isn't.\nWell, you told me about your business. Mine is a little more precarious and I earn considerably more.\nSo I've heard.\nSo has the government.\nWell, this may sound ridiculous, but you could pay 'em.\nOh, that would be against my nature.\nYou know San Francisco, don't you?\nYeah, I was there once for a party.\nAnd you got around?\nLike the monkey and the weasel.\nWould you like a gin and tonic?\nThat'd be nice.\nYou may have whiskey if you like.\nThat'd be even nicer.\nJust remember, I'm coming out of this in one piece, Miss Carson.\nDo you always go around leaving your fingerprints on a girl's shoulder? Not that I mind, particularly. You've got nice strong hands.\nKeep the martinis dry. I'll be back.\nFor a man who appears to be clever, you can certainly act like an idiot.\nThat's one way to be clever! Look like an idiot.\nYou look like an underweight ghost.\nWas there a slip up, baby?\nI'm the fall guy. There's only one thing missing. The plant. What was it that gives me a motive? I wouldn't kill a guy for a martini.\nI've never stopped loving you. I was afraid and no good, but, I've never stopped. Even if you'd hated me - did you?\nYes.\nYou know, sometimes a bad memory is like what they call an ill wind, it can blow somebody luck.\nWell, we meet in in all kinds of places.\nI'm running the show, don't forget it.\nI doubt you'll ever let me.\nRemember La Mar Azul?\nI remember you were a very clumsy flirt - but I like that. \n\nGiven quotes from the character above, which of the following tropes would you say this character represents?\n\nA: Absent Minded Professor\nB: Adventurer Archaeologist\nC: Arrogant Kungfu Guy\nD: Big Man On Campus\nE: Bounty Hunter\nF: Brainless Beauty\nG: Broken Bird\nH: Bromantic Foil\nI: Bruiser With A Soft Center\nJ: Bully\nK: Byronic Hero\nL: Casanova\nM: Chanteuse\nN: Charmer\nO: Child Prodigy\nP: Classy Cat Burglar\nQ: Consummate Professional\nR: Corrupt Corporate Executive\nS: Coward\nT: Crazy Jealous Guy\nU: Crazy Survivalist\nV: Cultured Badass\nW: Dean Bitterman\nX: Dirty Cop\nY: Ditz\nZ: Doormat\nAA: Drill Sargeant Nasty\nAB: Dumb Blonde\nAC: Dumb Muscle\nAD: Eccentric Mentor\nAE: Egomaniac Hunter\nAF: Evil Prince\nAG: Fastest Gun In The West\nAH: Father To His Men\nAI: Final Girl\nAJ: Gadgeteer Genius\nAK: Gentleman Thief\nAL: Granola Person\nAM: Grumpy Old Man\nAN: Hardboiled Detective\nAO: Heartbroken Badass\nAP: Henpecked Husband\nAQ: Hitman With A Heart\nAR: Jerk Jock\nAS: Junkie Prophet\nAT: Klutz\nAU: Loser Protagonist\nAV: Loveable Rogue\nAW: Master Swordsman\nAX: Morally Bankrupt Banker\nAY: Officer And A Gentleman\nAZ: Ophelia\nBA: Playful Hacker\nBB: Prima Donna\nBC: Psycho For Hire\nBD: Pupil Turned To Evil\nBE: Retired Outlaw\nBF: Revenge\nBG: Romantic Runnerup\nBH: Self Made Man\nBI: Slacker\nBJ: Stoner\nBK: Storyteller\nBL: Stupid Crooks\nBM: Surfer Dude\nBN: The Chief\nBO: The Editor\nBP: Tranquil Fury\nBQ: Trickster\nBR: Valley Girl\nBS: Warrior Poet\nBT: Young Gun\n",

Of your soul.\nWhere am I?\nHome, where I learned the truth about despair, as will you. There's a reason why this prison is the worst hell on earth... Hope. Every man who has ventured here over the centuries has looked up to the light and imagined climbing to freedom. So easy... So simple... And like shipwrecked men turning to sea water from uncontrollable thirst, many have died trying. I learned here that there can be no true despair without hope. So, as I terrorize Gotham, I will feed its people hope to poison their souls. I will let them believe they can survive so that you can watch them clamoring over each other to \"stay in the sun.\" You can watch me torture an entire city and when you have truly understood the depth of your failure, we will fulfill Ra's al Ghul's destiny... We will destroy Gotham and then, when it is done and Gotham is ashes, then you have my permission to die\nThere's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne. You and your friends better batten down the hatches, because when it hits, you're all gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little for the rest of us.\nYou sound like you're looking forward to it.\nI'm adaptable.\nDeshi basara! Deshi basara!\nWhat does that mean?\nRise.\nI watched you die.\nI told you I was immortal.\nMust've lost my ticket.\nYour wife said you were taking a cab home.\nMy wife?\nThis conversation used to end with an unusual request.\nI'm retired.\nWell let me show you some stuff anyway. Just for old time's sake.\nI've seen worse cartilage in knees.\nThat's good.\nNo, that's because there is NO cartilage in your knee, and not much of any use in your elbows or your shoulders. Between that and the scar tissue on your kidneys, the residual concussive damage to your brain tissue, and the general scarred-over quality of your body, I cannot recommend that you go heliskiing, Mr. Wayne\nRight.\nMind if I cut in?\nOh, you don't seem happy to see me.\nYou were supposed to be a shut-in.\nI felt like some fresh air.\nWhy didn't you call the police?\nI have a powerful friend who deals with things like this.\nThat's a brazen costume for a cat burglar.\nYeah? Who are you pretending to be?\nBruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire. Who's your date?\nHis wife's in Ibiza. She left her diamonds behind, though. Worried they might get stolen.\nMm. It's pronounced Ibeetha. You wouldn't want any of these folks realizing you're a crook, not a social climber.\nYou think I care what anyone in this room thinks of me?\nI doubt you care what anyone in any room thinks of you.\nDon't condescend, Mr. Wayne. You don't know a thing about me.\nWell, Selina Kyle, I know you came here from your walk-up in Old Town, a modest place for a master jewel thief. Which means that either you're saving for retirement, or you're in deep with the wrong people.\nYou don't get to judge me just because you were born in the master bedroom of Wayne Manor.\nActually, I was born in the Regency Room.\nI started out doing what I had to. Once you've done what you had to, they'll never let you do what you want to.\nStart fresh.\nThere's no fresh start in today's world. Any twelve-year-old with a cell phone could find out what you did. Everything we do is collated and quantified. Everything sticks.\nIs that how you justify stealing?\nI take what I need to from those who have more than enough. I don't stand on the shoulders of people with less.\nRobin Hood?\nI think I do more to help someone than most of the people in this room. Than you.\nI think maybe you're assuming a little too much.\nMaybe you're being unrealistic about what's really in your pants other than your wallet.\nOuch.\nYou steal from us, you little bastard?\nYou boys know you can't come into my neighborhood without asking politely.\nNever steal anything from someone you can't outrun, kid.\nPretty generous, for a thief.\nI thought they killed you.\nNot yet.\nIf you're expecting an apology...\nIt wouldn't suit you.\nWe were in this together, and then you were gone.\nThe Batman wasn't needed anymore. We won.\nBased on a lie. Now this evil... rises from where we tried to bury it. The Batman has to come back.\nWhat if he doesn't exist any more?\nHe must... he must...\nI'm not afraid. I'm angry.\nI need you to get me back in the game.\nBruce Wayne at a charity ball?\nMiss Tate, isn't it?\nEven before you became a recluse, you never came to these things.\nProceeds go to the big fat spread. It's not about charity, it's about feeding the ego of whichever society hag laid this on.\nActually, this is my party, Mr. Wayne.\nOh.\nAnd the proceeds will go where they should, because I paid for the big fat spread myself.\nThat's very generous of you.\nYou have to invest to restore balance to the world. Take our clean-energy project.\nSometimes the investment doesn't pay off. I'm sorry.\nYou have a practiced apathy, Mr. Wayne. But a man who doesn't care about the world doesn't spend half his fortune on a plan to save it. And isn't so wounded when it fails that he goes into hiding. Have a good evening, Mr. Wayne.\nIs it really painful?\nWell, you're welcome to try it, Alfred.\nHappy watching, thank you, sir.\nYou brought me out here to show me this, Mr. Fox?\nBear with me, Miss Tate.\nPlease keep hands and feet inside the car at all times.\nThis is it, isn't it?\nThe reactor is beneath the river so it could be instantly flooded in the event of a security breach.\nIs Bruce Wayne really that paranoid?\nI'm gonna plead the fifth on that one.\nI thought you might like to see what your investment built.\nNo fossil fuels. Free, clean energy for an entire city. Three years ago, a Russian scientist published a paper on weaponized fusion reactions. One week later your reactor started developing problems. I think this machine works.\nMiranda, if it were operational, the danger to Gotham would be too great.\nWould it make you feel better to know that the Russian scientist died in a plane crash six months ago?\nSomeone will work out what Dr. Pavel did. Someone will figure out a way to make this power source into a nuclear weapon. I need you to take control of Wayne Enterprises and this reactor.\nTo do what with it?\nNothing. Until we can guarantee its safety.\nAnd if we can't?\nDecommission it and flood it.\nDestroy the world's best chance for a sustainable future?\nIf the world's not ready, yes.\nBruce, if you want to save the world you have to start trusting it.\nI'm trusting you.\nDoesn't count. You have no choice.\nI could have flooded this chamber any time in the last three years. I'm choosing to trust you. Please.\nThis city needs me.\nI'll get this to Mr. Fox, but no more. I've sewn you up, I've set your bones, but I won't bury you. I've buried enough members of the Wayne family.\nYou'll leave me?\nYou see only one end to your journey. Leaving is all I have to make you understand, you're not Batman anymore. You have to find another way. You used to talk about finishing a life beyond that awful cape.\nRachel died believing that we would be together; that was my life beyond the cape. I can't just move on. She didn't, she couldn't.\nWhat if she had? What if, before she died, she wrote a letter saying she chose Harvey Dent over you? And what if, to spare your pain, I burnt that letter?\nHow dare you use Rachel to try to stop me?\nI am using the truth, Master Wayne. Maybe it's time we all stop trying to outsmart the truth and let it have its day. I'm sorry.\nYou're sorry? You expect to destroy my world and then think we're going to shake hands?\nNo... no, I know what this means.\nWhat does it mean?\nIt means your hatred... and it also means losing someone that I have cared for since I first heard his cries echo through this house. But it might also mean saving your life. And that is more important.\nGoodbye, Alfred.\nYou two should exchange notes over coffee.\nSo now you're trying to set me up with a jewel thief?\nAt this point, I'd set you up with a chimpanzee if it'd brought you back to the world!\nThere's nothing out there for me.\nAnd that's the problem. You hung up your cape and your cowl, but you didn't move on, you never went to find a life, to find someone...\nAlfred... I did find someone.\nI know, and you lost her. But that's all part of living, sir. But you're not living. You're just waiting, hoping for things to go bad again.\nIf this man is everything that you say he is, then this city needs me.\nThis city needs Bruce Wayne, your resources, your knowledge. It doesn't need your body, or your life. That time has passed.\nYou're afraid that if I go back out there I'll fail.\nNo. I'm afraid that you want to.\nIf you're seriously considering going back out there, you should hear the rumors surrounding Bane.\nI'm all ears.\nThere is a prison in a more ancient part of the world, a pit where men are thrown to suffer and die. But sometimes a man rises from the darkness. Sometimes the pit sends something back.\nBane.\nRight. Born and raised in hell on earth.\nBorn in prison?\nNo one knows why or how he escaped, but they do know that once he did he was trained by Ra's Al Ghul, your mentor.\nBane was a member of The League of Shadows.\nAnd then he was excommunicated. And any man who is too extreme for Ra's Al Ghul is not to be trifled with. \n\nGiven quotes from the character above, which of the following tropes would you say this character represents?\n\nA: Absent Minded Professor\nB: Adventurer Archaeologist\nC: Arrogant Kungfu Guy\nD: Big Man On Campus\nE: Bounty Hunter\nF: Brainless Beauty\nG: Broken Bird\nH: Bromantic Foil\nI: Bruiser With A Soft Center\nJ: Bully\nK: Byronic Hero\nL: Casanova\nM: Chanteuse\nN: Charmer\nO: Child Prodigy\nP: Classy Cat Burglar\nQ: Consummate Professional\nR: Corrupt Corporate Executive\nS: Coward\nT: Crazy Jealous Guy\nU: Crazy Survivalist\nV: Cultured Badass\nW: Dean Bitterman\nX: Dirty Cop\nY: Ditz\nZ: Doormat\nAA: Drill Sargeant Nasty\nAB: Dumb Blonde\nAC: Dumb Muscle\nAD: Eccentric Mentor\nAE: Egomaniac Hunter\nAF: Evil Prince\nAG: Fastest Gun In The West\nAH: Father To His Men\nAI: Final Girl\nAJ: Gadgeteer Genius\nAK: Gentleman Thief\nAL: Granola Person\nAM: Grumpy Old Man\nAN: Hardboiled Detective\nAO: Heartbroken Badass\nAP: Henpecked Husband\nAQ: Hitman With A Heart\nAR: Jerk Jock\nAS: Junkie Prophet\nAT: Klutz\nAU: Loser Protagonist\nAV: Loveable Rogue\nAW: Master Swordsman\nAX: Morally Bankrupt Banker\nAY: Officer And A Gentleman\nAZ: Ophelia\nBA: Playful Hacker\nBB: Prima Donna\nBC: Psycho For Hire\nBD: Pupil Turned To Evil\nBE: Retired Outlaw\nBF: Revenge\nBG: Romantic Runnerup\nBH: Self Made Man\nBI: Slacker\nBJ: Stoner\nBK: Storyteller\nBL: Stupid Crooks\nBM: Surfer Dude\nBN: The Chief\nBO: The Editor\nBP: Tranquil Fury\nBQ: Trickster\nBR: Valley Girl\nBS: Warrior Poet\nBT: Young Gun\n",
    "25": "You're wanted, Wales.\nReckon I'm right popular. You a bounty hunter?\nA man's got to do something for a living these days.\nDyin' ain't much of a living, boy.\nNow remember, when things look bad and it looks like you're not gonna make it, then you gotta get mean. I mean plumb, mad-dog mean. 'Cause if you lose your head and you give up then you neither live nor win. That's just the way it is.\nAre you gonna pull those pistols or whistle Dixie?\nKansas was all golden and smelled like sunshine.\nYeah, well, I always heard there were three kinds of suns in Kansas, sunshine, sunflowers, and sons-of-bitches.\nThese things you say we will have, we already have.\nThat's true. I ain't promising you nothing extra. I'm just giving you life and you're giving me life. And I'm saying that men can live together without butchering one another.\nIt's sad that governments are chiefed by the double tongues. There is iron in your words of death for all Comanche to see, and so there is iron in your words of life. No signed paper can hold the iron. It must come from men. The words of Ten Bears carries the same iron of life and death. It is good that warriors such as we meet in the struggle of life... or death. It shall be life.\nWhen I get to likin' someone, they ain't around long.\nI notice when you get to DISlikin' someone they ain't around for long neither.\nThey said a man could get rich on reward money if he could kill you.\nSeems like you was looking to gain some money here.\nActually, I was looking to gain an edge. I thought you might be someone who would sneak up behind me with a gun.\nWhere'd you ever get an idea like that? Besides it ain't supposed to be easy to sneak up behind an Indian\nI'm an Indian, all right; but here in the nation they call us the \"civilized tribe\". They call us \"civilized\" because we're easy to sneak up on. White men have been sneaking up on us for years.\nI wish we had time to bury them fellas.\nTo hell with them fellas. Buzzards gotta eat, same as worms.\nDyin' ain't much of a livin', boy.\nHowdy.\nHowdy.\nSomethin' wrong?\nUh, no.\nI guess you were right.\nI ain't that old after all.\nI think I'll go down to Mexico to try to find him.\nAnd then?\nHe's got the first move. I owe him that. I think I'll try to tell him the war is over. What do you say, Mr. Wilson?\nI reckon so. I guess we all died a little in that damn war.\nYou have any food here?\nAll I have is a piece of hard rock candy. But it's not for eatin'. It's just for lookin' through.\nThat meal was damn good. I'm gonna take up teepee livin' if it's like this. You know she thinks I'm some kind of a Cherokee chief.\nI wonder where she ever got that idea.\nName's Anderson. Bloody Bill's what they call me.\nRed Legs? You'll find them up in Kansas. They're with the Union. And we're goin' up there and set things aright.\nI'll be comin' with you.\nI'm gettin' better at sneaking up on you like this. Only an Indian can do something like this.\nThat's what I figured.\nYou figured?\nOnly an Indian could do something like that.\nIt's not right; this damn woman doing something like this to me. I used to have power. Now old age is creeping up on me.\nMore like old habits than old age.\nSo, you'll be Josey Wales.\nNow, how might you know that, Granny?\nSoldiers were here looking for you 'bout two hours ago.\nUh, I was goin' to mention that to you... as soon as I got the chance.\nThey say you killed your own men.\nThose lying, blue-scum bellies...\nThey say you're a hard put and desperate man, Josey Wales. They're goin' to heel and hide you to a barn door. You know what I say?\nWhat's that?\nI say that big talk's worth doodly-squat. Now, them poultices be laced with feathermoss and mustard root. Mind you drop water on 'em occasional and keep 'em damp.\nYou can pay me when you see me again, Josey Wales.\nI reckon so.\nYour young friend could use some help.\nThis is it... one dollar a bottle. It works wonders on wounds.\nWorks wonders on just about everything, eh?\nIt can do most anything.\nHow is it with stains?\nThis boy was brought up in a time of blood and dying and never questioned a bit of it. He never turned his back on his folks or his kind. I rode with him... and I got no complaints. The blue bellies will give ya a better burial than I can, boy.\nYou can't get 'em all, Josey.\nThat's a fact.\nHow come you're doing this, then?\nBecause I ain't got nothin' better to do.\nWhat'll you have?\nWhiskey.\nMaybe you'd like somethin' else.\nBeer?\nBeen a long time since somebody ordered a drink in San Rio.\nBeen a long time since we had anythin' to drink.\nYep, first the silver run out, then the people run out, then the whiskey run out, then the beer run out. Don't matter, it's good to see a high roller come through.\nWhat's the matter with him?\nI guess some folks don't like to be called 'high rollers'. I knew a man once; he didn't like to be called 'high handed'.\nI reckon so.\nChief, I was just wondering: I suppose that mangy red-bone hound's got no place else to go either.\nHe might as well ride along with us; Hell, everybody else is.\nI figured you could use some help.\nYou get those holes a-leakin', I'm gonna whomp you with a knotted plow line.\nThen you will die.\nI came here to die with you. Or live with you. Dying ain't hard for men like you and me. It's living that's hard when all you've ever cared about has been butchered or raped.\nAnyone gets hit, sing out. Slap iron to it. It's the fastest way to stop the blood.\nThey comin'.\nDo you really think you can shoot all those men down before they shoot you? No, no, Mr. Josey Wales; there is such a thing in this country called justice!\nWell, Mr. Carpetbagger. We got somethin' in this territory called the Missouri boat ride.\nHe's\nhas got the first move And I'd tell him.\nWhat's that?\nThat the war is over.\nI reckon we all lost a little bit in that damn war.\nYou dumb kid.\nAshes to ashes, dust to dust.

And I'm parting.\nShe's dead!\nShe is? Oh. These are the moments that make life worth living.\nI tell you what, kids, it's, uh, odd thing here. Your wrist, uh, far as I can tell, is, uh, fractured in three places. Uh, and you've shattered, uh, two vertebrae, though I can't be certain without an X-ray... The bone protrusion through the skin - that's not a good sign. You're body temperature is below 80, and your, your, your heart's stopped beating.\nWhat the hell does that mean?\nExactly! What... what... I'm going to get a second opinion.\nWell, it could be worse.\nHave you seen her yet?\nWhat a joke. She's not even here.\nWait. Look over there.\nOh! Looks as though she's lost a few pou-\nAh! Wha-what are you doing?\nI'm loving you.\nYou're a powerful sexual being, Ernest.\nI am?\nYes, you are. If I never told you before, it was because I wasn't the sort of girl who could say the word \"sexual\" without blushing. Well I can now. Sexual... sensual... sexy... sex... sex... sex...\nOh my god...\nOh! Thank you!\nGo on... Drink it... It is the completion of your life's work. You gave other people youth and wasted your own! Drink. And you will be able to work again forever! Drink... drink, Dr. Menville. You owe yourself another chance! Drink! It's the right choice! The *only* choice! Drink! SEMPRE VIVE! LIVE FOREVER!\nThen what?\nWhat?\nThen what happens?\nWhat?\nI don't want to live forever. I mean, it sounds good, but what am I gonna do? What if I get bored?\nWhat?\nAnd what if I get lonely? Who am I gonna hang around with, Madeleine and Helen?\nI hope you don't mind that Harry and Dick had to dress you... You were inproperly attired, for the occasion.\nWhat occasion?\nI'm throwing a party upstairs... I throw one every Spring, for my clients.\nAll right... ok... what do you want with me?\nFor you... I'd like to give a present... The gift of life and youth, forever...\nEn garde! *Bitch*!\nGirls, girls! Let's just calm down! I'm sure we can settle this peacefully and nego...

I can *see*... my ASS!\nAnd there's something really wrong with your neck too.\nI never had a chance to thank you for the spectacular job you did with my Aunt Esther.\nOh, well, thank you very much.\nHer color, her tone. You even brought out her cheekbones.\nWell, that's my job.\nIt was almost a shame to bury her.\nIt's so sweet of you to say that.\nCan I ask you what your secret is?\nSpray paint. You see, you can't just use regular makeup on dead skin. The pores are too dry. You've gotta use a palette and grind the stuff in. One day I'm in the hardware store and I think to myself, \"What about mannequin paint?\"It's got its own chemical adhesive, comes in an incredible variety of flesh...\nExcuse me!\nLife has turned out as quite a party.\nYou used to hate parties.\nThat was when I was old. You should see me now.\nI didn't know you were so unhappy.\nLife in prison? Know what that means to a person in your condition?\nSo negative. Let me enjoy the moment.\nWhat about the neighbors?\nNeighbors? In 12 years in Los Angeles, have you ever seen a neighbor?\nWho cares how I played? I won!\nI'll just be upstairs...\nThat's 'cause you could raise your legs higher than anyone.\nDo you know what they call someone who sticks by their word no matter what? At the cost of all else? Do you know?\nNo.\nAn idiot. From now on I'm gonna be the kind of idiot *I* wanna be. An idiot with a modicum of pride, because you know what? I finally realized something.

    "27": "Max, six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape cause of one fat guy.\nWell, who was he?\nWhat do you care? Have you ever heard of Rwanda?\nYes, I know Rwanda.\nWell, tens of thousands killed before sundown. Nobody's killed people that fast since Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Did you bat an eye, Max?\nWhat?\nDid you join Amnesty International, Oxfam, Save the Whales, Greenpeace, or something? No. I off one fat Angelino and you throw a hissy fit.\nMan, I don't know any Rwandans.\nYou don't know the guy in the trunk, either.\nLook in the mirror. Paper towels, clean cab. Limo company some day. How much you got saved?\nThat ain't any of your business.\nSomeday? Someday my dream will come? One night you will wake up and discover it never happened. It's all turned around on you. It never will. Suddenly you are old. Didn't happen, and it never will, because you were never going to do it anyway. You'll push it into memory and then zone out in your barco lounger, being hypnotized by daytime TV for the rest of your life. Don't you talk to me about murder. All it ever took was a down payment on a Lincoln town car. That girl,you can't even call that girl. What the fuck are you still doing driving a cab?\nA guy gets on the MTA here L.A. and dies. Think anybody'll notice?\nGet with it. Millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars, in a speck on one in a blink. That's us, lost in space. The cop, you, me... Who notices?\nTake comfort in knowing you never had a choice.\nOkay, look, here's the deal. Man, you were gonna drive me around tonight, never be the wiser, but El Gordo got in front of a window, did his high dive, we're into Plan B. Still breathing? Now we gotta make the best of it, improvise, adapt to the environment, Darwin, shit happens, I Ching, whatever man, we gotta roll with it.\nI Ching? What are you talking about, man? You threw a man out of a window.\nI didn't throw him. He *fell*\nWell what did he do to you?\nWhat?\nWhat did he do to *you*?\nNothing. I only met him tonight.\nYou just met him once and you killed him like that?\nWhat? I should only kill people after I get to know them?\nThey project onto you their flaws, what they don't like about themselves. I had a father like that.\nMothers are worse.\nWouldn't know. My mother died before I remember her.\nWhat about your father?\nHated everything I did. Got drunk, beat me up. In and out of foster homes, that kinda thing.\nAnd then?\nI killed him. I was twelve.\nI'm kidding. He died of liver disease.\nWell, I'm sorry.\nNo, you're not.\nI can't drive you around while you're killing folks. It ain't my job!\nTonight it is.\nThere's no good reason, there's no bad reason to live or to die.\nThen what are you?\nI'm indifferent.\nLets go.\nHey, why don't you just take the cab?\nTake the cab?\nYeah, you take it. I'll - I'll chill. I'll - I'll just chill. They don't even know who's driving these things half the time anyway. They never check or anything. Okay... so... just - just take it. You, me...\nYou promise not to tell anybody right?\nYeah... yeah... yeah... promise.\nGet in the fucking car.\nHey.\nHe, he, he fell on the cab. He fell, he fell from up there on the motherfucking cab. Shit. I think he's dead.\nGood guess.\nYou killed him?\nNo, I shot him. Bullets and the fall killed him.\nYo, homey! That my briefcase?\nFirst time in L.A.?\nNo. Tell you the truth, whenever I'm here I can't wait to leave. It's too sprawled out, disconnected. You know? That's me. You like it?\nIt's my home.\n17 million people. This was a country, it'd be the fifth biggest economy in the world and nobody knows each other. I read about this guy, gets on the MTA here, dies.\nOh.\nSix hours he's riding the subway before anybody notices his corpse doing laps around L.A., people on and off sitting next to him. Nobody notices.\nMost people - same job, same gig, doing the same thing 10 years from now. Us, we don't know what we are doing 10 minutes from now.\nWell, that was brilliant...\nMax, I do this for a living!\nYou're full of shit.\nI'm full of shit? You're a monument of it. You even bullshitted yourself, all I am is taking out the garbage, killing bad people.\nYeah, well that's what you said.\nYou believed me?\nThen what'd they do?\nHow do I know, you know? They all got that 'witness for the prosecution' look to me. Probably some major federal indictment of somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted.\nHey! Flowers?\nIt's a waste of money. Won't mean a thing to her.\nShe carried you in her womb for nine months. People buy flowers. Buy flowers.\nSomeday my dream will come. One night you'll wake up and you'll discover it never happened. It's all turned around on you and it never will. Suddenly you are old, didn't happened and it never will, 'cause you were never going to do it anyway.\nYou're alive. I saved you. Do I get any thanks? No. All you can do is clam up. You wanna talk? Tell me to fuck off?\nFuck off.\nI'm not taking you to see my mother.\nSince when was any of this negotiable?\nYeah, Lenny, what's up? It's me.\nJust got off the phone with the cops. Desk sergeant called to check if you brought the cab in?\nYeah, so?\nSo, aside from I hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the goddamn cab?\nNo, no, I got crashed into. I didn't...\nDo I care what, where, why? You're paying.\nIt was an accident. You're not liable.\nIt was an accident. I'm not liable.\nBullshit. I'm making you liable. It's coming out of your goddamn pocket.\nYou tell him to stick this cab up his fat ass.\nI can't do that, that's my boss.\nSo?\nI need my job.\nNo, you don't.\nYou attract attention, you're going to get people killed who didn't need to be.\nWhy didn't you just kill me and get another cab driver?\nCause you're good. We're in this together. Fates intertwined. Cosmic Coincidence.\nJust when I thought you were a cool guy.\nI am a cool guy, with a job I contracted to do.\nIf you open that trunk, they go inside.\nOnly thing that didn't show up is the Polish cavalry.\nHow long have you been doing this? In case anyone asks?\nPrivate sector? Six years.\nUh... you get health benefits? Pension...?\nNo, and no paid vacation. Quit stalling, and get in there.\nStill there? I'm talking to you. Max. Max!\nHe's not paying you a damn thing.\nWho the hell is this?\nAlbert Ricardo, Assistant U.S. Attorney, a passenger in this cab, and I'm reporting you to the D.M.V.\nLet's not, oh, let's not get excited.\nNot get excited? How am I supposed to not get excited? Listen, you try to extort a working man. You know goddamn well your collision policy and general liability umbrella will cover the damages. And what are you trying to pull, you sarcastic prick?\nLook, I was just trying to...\nTell it to him.\nTell him he's an asshole. Go ahead.\nYou're an asshole.\nTell him he pulls this shit again, you're gonna stick this yellow cab up his fat ass.\nAnd, and next time you pull any shit, I'm gonna... I'm gonna have to stick this yellow cab up... up your fat ass.\nLimos, huh?\nDon't start.\nHey, I'm not the one lying to my mother.\nShe hears what she wants to hear. I don't disillusion her.\nYeah, right. Maybe she hears what you tell her.\nWhatever I tell her is never good enough anyway. It's always been that way. So whats at El Rodeo?\nJust drive.\nThey project onto you their flaws. What they don't like about themselves, their lives, whatever. They rank on you instead.\nHow do you know?\"\nLady Macbeth. Leave the seats. The light's green. We're sitting here.\nAsshole!\nYou no longer have the cleanest cab in La-La Land. You gotta live with that. Focus on the job. Drive.\nDon't get me cornered. You don't have the trunk space.\nYou got ten minutes. 10:01? I drive the cab to the hospital and execute your mother on my way out of town, and don't pretend indifference.\nI can't do this.\nWhat's your name?\nMax.\nMax. I'm Vincent.\nYou OK?\nYeah, I'm fine mate, don't worry about it.\nOf all the cabbies in L.A. I get Max, Sigmund Freud meets Dr. Ruth.\nWhat's with you, man?\nAs in?\nAs in, if somebody had a gun to your head and said, \"You gotta tell me what's going on with this person over here or I'm gonna kill you. What is driving him? What is he thinking?\" You know, you couldn't do it, could you? Because they would have to kill your ass because you don't know what anyone else is thinking. I think you're low, my brother. Way low.\nGive me your wallet. Come on.\nGive you my wallet. For what?\nI'll hold it for you in case the people inside search you.\nWho's searching?\nThe people inside. Go in, ask for Felix. He's expecting you.\nFelix?\nYeah.\nWhat does he look like?\nI don't know. I've never met him.\nWho is he?\nHe's connected to the guys who hired me.\nI don't get it.\nYou destroyed my workups. Number Four is due. What'd you think? The night's over? Called on account of rain? You go in there. Say you're me. Score the backups. They'll be on flash drive or CD.\nMe? How come you don't go?\nI don't meet people. Risk management. Anonymity. I protect mine. You're not gonna' screw that up. I got a contract with they're bosses. These guys don't get to meet me. They don't know what I look like.\nIf I don't pull it off, then...\nThey will kill you. Now, you've got ten minutes. At 10:01 I drive to the hospital and execute your mother on my way out of town. And don't pretend indifference.\nI can't do this. I can't.\nWhat are you talking about? Sure you can, man. Come on. Hey! Hey!\nLook, man. If I do this, I'm just gonna end up getting other people killed.\nOut of options, Max. Just take comfort in knowing you never had a choice.\nHow long have you been doing this?\nWhy?\nJust in case they ask.\nPrivate sector, six years.\nRed light, Max.\nLet her go.\nMax? Why? What are you gonna do about it?\nOkay. All right. Six years. You get benefits? Or, you know, like insurance? Pension?\nNo, no paid sick leave. Quit stalling.

    "29": "There are special people in this world. We don't ask to be special. We're just born this way. We pass you on the streets every day, unnoticed by most. It started in 1945. The Nazis were conducting experiments in psychic warfare, trying to turn those with psychic abilities into soldiers. Lots of us died. The war ended, but the experiments never stopped. Other governments around the world set up what they called \"divisions\", trying to do what the Nazis couldn't, to turn us into weapons. The divisions agents are trained to track and hunt us down like animals. Take us away from our families and friends. They test us and categorize us. I'm what they call a Watcher. We can see the future, even if that's not always as simple as it sounds. Others are called Movers; just an easy way of saying telekinetic. Pushers put thoughts in your head, and make whatever lie they come up with the truth. Sniffs, Shifters, Shadows, Bleeders... it goes on and on. In divisions' eyes, we're all just lab rats. Only one problem - we keep dying. No one has ever survived the drug meant to boost our powers. My name is Cassie Holmes. Division took my mom from me. Right now, the future I see doesn't look so great. The good news is, the future is always changing, in the largest of ways, by the smallest of things. They've been winning a lot of battles. Now it's our turn to win the war.\nTell me I'm a crappy artist and that everything is going to be fine.\nYou are a *crappy* artist. Everything is going to be fine, I promise.\nNick!\nBring an umbrella. It's gonna rain.\nYou be careful too.\nYou better do something quick, 'cause I'm getting sick of drawing dead bodies!\nHow are we going to make the future unpredictable?\nBy not knowing what we're going to do, until right before we do it.\nA plan without planning.\nHow long do you think your mom's been planning this?\nProbably since before I was born.\nDid you lose a bet with your hairdresser?\nNo! I just like color!\nHey, what did I inject myself with?\nNine Dragons Soy Sauce.\nThat's gross.\nYou already know the ending to this story. You can only draw it so many ways.\nWe're going to change it.\nHey, whoa whoa whoa...\nExcuse me.\nThis how you treat your guests?\nThis is how I treat random strangers who barge into my apartment.\nStupid child. I already saw how you die.\nThen you know it's not here, and it's not today.\nVodka martini.\nThank you.\nI'll have one of those.\nShe'll have a Coke.\nMy mom drinks when she wants to get really clear images. She's famous for it.\nMaybe something without caffeine.\nI know who you are. When I was in Division, your mother was at the top of every watchlist there was.\nYou worked for division?\nYou want to know about division? Ten years. No thank you. No pension. I was put out on the street with the threat not to shift again. Only the Sniffs caught up with me in Chicago. I was just trying to buy something nice for my wife. Next day, I get a call. She's dead. Car accident. But my wife doesn't drive.\nMy father expects me to find that suitcase.\nSo does my mother.\nBut you don't see it clearly, do you? Too many things keep changing. I already saw how you die. Did you see it yet?\nYou can change it, you know. Plenty of planes leaving Hong Kong every day.\nOh, we *are* going to change it.\nYou put a Shadow on the girl. You know that's only temporary. That girl is the one who brings all your little fantasy crashing down. So tell Nick something for me, little girl.

Tell him that's the future I see.\nWhere's the chicky-chicky who gets us all killed?\nAre you drunk?\nYeah.\nI heard what she said about your mother.\nYou did? Division's got her. They locked her up because she's the greatest Watcher they've ever seen. They're afraid of her, and they're afraid they can't control it.\nThey killed my father for the same reason. But I guess you already knew that.\nI see the future, not the past. Right now, our future is not that great.\nSorry, I didn't know the procedure for stopping a blitzed ten year old.\nI'm thirteen!\nFirst thing's first. I know you're a second generation Mover.\nIs that what the kids are calling it these days?\nI'll let you know when I see one. You don't really use your powers, which means you haven't practiced, so you kind of suck at it. How am I doing so far?\nGo on.\nI'm a Watcher. Second generation, like you.\nWow, that's...\nComplicated, cause the future can change just by talking about it, so I see glimpses, and I draw about it in my book, but I'm not really good at it. I'm kind of a crappy artist, but I'm sure you already knew that.\nAre you with division?\nAre you looking at us?\nAre you okay?\nNo. Not until we find that case.\nWhen was the last time you saw it?\nNot since yesterday. Not for lack of trying. If we don't find it soon, they're going to kill my mom. And it's going to be my fault.\nLook at me. Hey...\nLook at me. You really think I'm going to let that happen? Now you said that the future is always changing, right? It can change just by knowing it?\nIt can change. Doesn't mean it will.\nGood enough.\nWhat are you doing? What are you going to go do?\nI'm going to try to make a better one.\nYou don't get it, Nick. She's the one that kills us all, basically!\nWell I guess we're all going to get killed!\nYeah! It's screwed up!\nBy we, do you mean not...\nYou too!\nYou make me look like a fool in front of my family!\nDon't worry. You won't remember a thing.\nWho sent you?\nYour mother. A week before she was captured by Division, she told me to be at that fish market today.\nStay away from him.\nIf that's what you want. Just be sure to add his picture to the Wall of the Dead.\nYou look like shit.\nPlease don't make me do anything to myself.\nI'm 13, and I've been told I look at least 14.\nWe need this.\nAn olive?\nIt's a bead.\nI think I just saved your life. No need to thank me, you should just start listening to me.\nI am thirteen.

And there used to be a way to stick it to the Man, it was called rock 'n roll. But guess what? Oh no. The Man ruined that, too, with a little thing called MTV!

No, you cannot. Because when it comes to their kids, these parents have no sense of humor. No. And if something goes wrong its my head in the smasher.

But when I get up there and start doing my thing, people worship me! Because I'm sexy, and chubby, man.\nWhy don't you go on a diet?\nBecause I like to eat! Is that such a crime?\nCome on man, we're on a mission. One great rock show can change the world... look out the window...\nNo way! That's so punk rock.\nYou, Freddy, what do you like to do?\nI dunno.\nBurn stuff?\nMath is a wonderful thing. Math is a really cool thing. So get off your ath, let's do some math. Math, math, math, math, math. Three minus four is?\nNegative one.\nThat's right. And six times a billion is?\nSix billion?\nNailed it. And fifty-four is forty-five more than what is the answer, Marta?\nNine.\nNo, it's eight.\n...No, it's nine.\n...Yes, I was testing you... it's nine. And that's a magic number.\nGive up, just quit, because in this life, you can't win. Yeah, you can try, but in the end you're just gonna lose, big time, because the world is run by the Man.\nWho?\nThe Man. Oh, you don't know the Man? He's everywhere. In the White House, down the hall... Ms. Mullins, she's the Man. And the Man ruined the ozone, and he's burning down the Amazon, and he kidnapped Shamu and put her in a chlorine tank! Okay? And there used to be a way to stick it to the Man, it was called rock 'n roll. But guess what? Oh no. The Man ruined that, too, with a little thing called MTV! So don't waste your time trying to make anything cool, or pure, or awesome, 'cause the Man is just gonna call you a fat washed up loser and crush your soul. So do yourselves a favor and just GIVE UP!\nIn the words of AC/DC: We roll tonight... to the guitar bite... and for those about to rock... I salute you.\nI'm a teacher. All I need are minds for molding.\nGroupie?\nWhat's the matter?\nYou want me to be a groupie?\nWell, a groupie's an important job.\nI researched groupies on the Internet. They're sluts! They sleep with the band!\nNo, that's not true. They're like cheerleaders.\nLead guitar... Zack Attack. On bass... Posh Spice. On keyboards, Mr. Cool. And on drums, Spazzy McGee. OK, Blondie, Brace Face, you're singing backup. All right, Tough Guy, Shortstop, Fancy Pants, get over here. You're on security detail.\nCan I be the band stylist instead?\nOf course you can, Fancy Pants. OK. Carrot Top, Roadrunner, Turkey Sub, we're gonna have a lot of equipment... And you three...\ngroupies... As for me, I will be singing lead vocal and shredding guitar.\nWould you care to join us, Mr. Schneebly?\nYeah.\nDid I say that correctly? \"Schneebly\"?\nActually, it's \"Schnayblay\".\nUm, are we going to be goofing off like this every day?\nUh, we're not goofing off. We're creating musical fusion.\nWell, um, are we going to be creating musical fusion every day?\nYeah, get used to it.\nOkay, whose got food in here?\nYou're not gonna get in trouble, I'm hungry.\nLook, the first thing you do when you start a band is talk about your influences. That's how you figure out what kind of band you want to be. So who do you like? Blondie?\nChristina Aguilera.\nWho? No. Come on. What? You, Shortstop.\nPuff Daddy.\nWrong. Billy?\nLiza Minnelli?\nCome on come on come on/Touch me babe, bada bada, can't you see/ that I am not afraid, shaga tada!/ Lawrence is good at piano/He shall be rocking in my show, shaga tada!\nThey hate me.\nNo they don't.\nYes they do, I can see. I wasn't always like this, you know, I wasn't always wound this tight. There was a time where I was fun. I was funny! I was. But you can't be funny and be the principle of a prep school! No, you cannot. Because when it comes to their kids, these parents have no sense of humor. No. And if something goes wrong its my head in the smasher. And these parents will come down on me like a nucular bomb! I can't make a mistake! I gotta be perfect! And that pressure has turned me into something that I never wanted to be!\nA bitch!\nNo you're not.\nYes I am. I am a big one!\nWhat is that?\nIt's an encore. They want us to go play another song! It's good! Go, you guys!\nWait, no, no, just the band! Okay. Everybody, go!\nOk, here's the deal. I have a hangover. Who knows what that means?\nDoesn't that mean you're drunk?\nNo. It means I was drunk yesterday.\nIt means you're an alcoholic.\nWrong.\nYou wouldn't come to work with a hangover unless you were an alcoholic. Dude, you got a disease!\nHmmm... hmmm... What's your name?\nFreddy Jones.\nOk, Freddy Jones, shut up!\nNow raise your goblet of rock. It's a toast to those who rock!\nRead between the lines!\nNo you're not hardcore! Unless you live hardcore! And the legend of the rent was way hardcore!\nDude, is my face okay? I think you melted it off.\nMay I have the attention of the class: Today's ASSignment...\n, , :\n...kick some ass!\n, , :\n...kick some ass!\n, , :\n...kick some ass!\nOK, Ms DumBum ain't your teacher today, I am, and I have a headache and the runs. So I say, time for recess!\n... And therefore, E=MC2. Oh, Miss Mullins, come in.\nI'm sorry to interupt but Miss Lemmons said she heard music coming from the classroom.\nMusic? Uh, music. I haven't heard any music. Uh oh, you know what, Miss Lemmons must be on crack, right, kids?\nUh, well, what's that?\nMr. S? We came up with some names for the band.\nAll right, hit me.\nThe Bumblebees?\nNo, it's too sissy.\nThe Koala Bears?\nNo, what are you talking about? It's too sissy.\nHey, Miss Mullins.\nHow about, Pig Rectum?\nMichelle!\nIt's a science project.\nMs. Mullins, would like to get a cup of coffee with me?\nYou'd like me to get a coffee with you?\nYeah, I would.\nAre you sure you don't sell coffee here?\nUh-huh, I'm quite sure.\nThe thing is, Mr. Schneebly...\nPlease... call me Dewey.\nDewey?\nNed. Ned. I was thinking of my other name. My middle name.\nI LOVE THIS SONG!\nReally?\nYes! Stevie Nicks!\nYeah... Stevie!\nYou know, she came to town and she did a concert and she was just so... wild! Oh my gosh! Oh!\nYeah, she put on the best show I've ever seen. And she is so much better live than she is on the album!\nYes, oh my gosh! No comparison!\nYou know, I'd like to take the kids to a concert.\nConcert?\nThere is one at the end of the month... but you have a policy about field trips.\nWould it be... educational?\nWould it be educational? It would be VERY educational. They play Beethoven and Mozart and stuff.\nMaybe we can make an exception!\nYES!\n, :\n\nSings a song, sounds like she's singing whooo! Baby whoo! Said whooo!\n, :\n\nSings a song, sounds like she's singing whooo! Baby whoo! Said whooo!\nWell I went today, maybe I will go again... TOMORROW!\nDude, I service society by rocking, OK? I'm out there on the front lines liberating people with my music!\nListen! You can't leave. You haven't heard our band.\nSorry, the bill is full. We're already overbooked.\nNo, let us just play one song. We're all here, we're ready to go.\nWho are they?\nThey're my band.\nKids? What is this, some kind of gimmick?\nNo, it's not a gimmick. I know, they're kids, but they're awesome. Just listen!\nLook, thanks for comin' down, but you're really not what we're looking for.\nYou listen to me! These kids have worked their little fingers to the bone just to play one song for you so you just sit down, shut up and listen!\nSheila, call security.\nWould you tell Picasso to sell one of his guitars?\nOh, my God! He's an *idiot*!\nSlap it.\nShoot it.\nKaboot it.\nAll right, that's it. Stop, you guys, stop. Seriously, you guys. All right, take five. Take five. You wanna go? All right. That was a good class.\nI'll see you, man.\nDoes anyone play drums?\nI play percussion.\nYea, that's cause he couldn't play anything else!\nShut up!\nUh, how long is the job?\nMy guess is, as much as a few weeks, but we do need somebody to start immediately.\nMm-hm. So how much are we talking here?\nWe pay our substitutes $650 a week. Now, do you know when Mr. Schneebly will be back?\nHold on a sec. Oh, you know what? I think he's just coming in right now. NED! PHONE!\nHello, this is Ned Schneebly.\nYou don't have to worry about me because I'm a hard-ass. And if a kid gets out of line, I got no problem smacking them in the head.\nAnd we're gonna start a revolution, okay? And you're gonna be a funny little footnote on my epic ass!\nWho are you, babe? This is my apartment, babe.\nOh oh, not if you don't pay your rent, it's not.\nSummer, you're the class whatever. Go to the board\nFactotum.\nFactoter.\nI'll have the rent by the end of the week, go tell the mayor.\nGo! Play! Have fun! Now!\nThat was INCREDIBLE! Oh my gosh, the light shows, the guitar solos and... What it REALLY you playing?\nSo are you not mad with me?\nMAD? I'm FURIOUS! I'm HORRIFIED! But your show and performance was so INCREDIBLE, SPECTACULAR and Sooooooooo AMAZING! I can't believe it\nCome on, this project is called \"Rock Band\"! I'm talking about bands that *rock*. Led Zeppelin!\nDon't tell me you guys have never gotten the Led out. Jimmy Page? Robert Plant? Ring any bells? What about Sabbath?\nAC/DC? Mötorhead?\nUgh, what do they teach in this place?\nAh... Okay. Teach, teach, teach... All right, look, here's the deal. I've got a hangover. Who knows what that means?\nDoesn't that mean you're drunk?\nNo. It means I was drunk yesterday.\nIt means you're an alcoholic.\nWrong.\nYou wouldn't come to work hungover unless you were an alcoholic. Dude, you got a disease.\nHmm. Hmm. What's your name?\nFreddy Jones.\nHmm. Freddy Jones, SHUT UP!\nShut up.\nPoint is, y'all can just chill today. We'll start on this crap-ola tomorrow.\nGive me a platform. Let's rock, let's rock, today. Now do it to me.\nLet's rock, let's rock, today.\nThat's good.

It's me.\nProve it!\nYou're a dick.\nOkay.\nYou actually go outside in these things?\nWell, what would you prefer, yellow spandex?\nWhen they come out... does it hurt?\nEvery time.\nYou know, you should wear your seat belt.\nNow look, kid, I don't need advice on auto...\nLogan, is that you?\nSomething is wrong.\nCome on. We need to regroup.\nThere's just one problem.\nYou're not part of the group!\nThe first boy I ever kissed ended up in a coma for three weeks. I can still feel him inside my head. It's the same with you.\nThere's not many people that'll understand what you're going through. But I think this guy, Xavier, is one of them. He seems to genuinely want to help you. And that's a rare thing, for people like us. So... what do you say, we give these geeks one more shot?\nC'mon, I'll take care of you.\nYou promise?\nYeah... Yeah, I promise.\nWhy do none of you understand what I'm trying to do? Those people down there- they control our fate and the fate of every other mutant! Well, soon our fate will be theirs.\nYou're so full of shit! If you're really so righteous, it'd be you in that thing.\nWhere are you going?\nTo find her.\nHow?\nThe traditional way: look!\nAh, Logan. I'd like you to meet Ororo Monroe, also called Storm. This is Scott Summers, also called Cyclops. They saved your life. I believe you already know Dr. Jean Grey. You are in my School for the Gifted for Mutants. You'll be safe here from Magneto.\nWhat's a Magneto?\nA very powerful mutant. He believes that a war is brewing between mutants and the rest of humanity. I've been following his activities for some time. The man who attacked you is an associate of his called Sabertooth.\nSabertooth?\nStorm.\nWhat do they call you? \"Wheels\"? This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Students.\nAnd Cyclops, right?\nYou wanna get outta my way?\nLogan, it's been almost fifteen years, hasn't it? Living from day to day, moving from place to place, with no memory of who or what you are.\nShut up!\nGive me a chance. I might be able to help you find some answers.\nHow do you know?\nYou're not the only one with special gifts.\nYou going to tell me to stay away from your girl?\nIf I had to do that, she wouldn't be my girl.\nWell, then I guess you've got nothing to worry about, do ya, Cyclops?\nIt must burn you up that a boy like me saved your life, huh? Gotta be careful. I might not be there next time. Oh, and Logan - stay away from my girl.\nWhat did she do to me...?\nWhenever Rogue touches someone, she takes their energy: their life force. In the case of mutants, she absorbs their gifts for a short while; in your case your ability to heal.\nFelt like she killed me...\nIf she held on any longer, she could have.\nHow is she?\nShe's fine.\nI think she's still taken with you.\nWell you can tell her... my heart belongs to... someone else.\nI think you'll be comfortable here.\nWhere's your room?\nWith Scott, down the hall.\nIs that your gift? Putting up with that guy?\nActually, I'm telekinetic. I can move things with my mind.\nReally? What kind of things?\nAll kinds of things. I also have some telepathic ability.\nLike the Professor?\nNowhere near that powerful. But he's teaching me to develop it.\nI'm sure he is. So read my mind.\nI'd rather not.\nC'mon. You afraid you might like it?\nI doubt it.\nMagneto's right: there is a war coming. Are you sure you're on the right side?\nAt least I've chosen a side.\nAll right, we can insert here at the George Washington Bridge, come around the bank just off of Manhattan, land on the far side of Liberty Island, here.\nWhat about harbor patrol, radar?\nIf they have anything that can pick up our jet, they deserve to catch us.\nWait a second! You said this machine draws its power from Magneto, and that it weakened him.\nYes, in fact it nearly killed him.\nHe's going to transfer his power to Rogue and use her to power the machine.\nYou owe me some money.\nCome on, Stu.\nNo one takes a beating like that without a mark to show for it.\nCome on, Stu...\nI know what you are.\nYou lost your money. You keep this up you'll lose something else.\nGotta get her out of there. Cyclops, can you hit it?\nThe ring's moving too fast.\nJust shoot it!\nI'll kill her!\nWell, it certainly is a big, round room.\nYou could fly right over the torch.\nThen let me go. If I don't make it, then at least you can still blast the damn thing!\nAll right, do it. Jean use your power, try to steady him.\nHang on to something.\nJean...\nScott, when I tell you, open your eyes.\nNo!\nTrust me.\nYou drop something?\nThis is a military base situated near Alkali Lake. It isn't much, but if you go there, you might get a few clues as to what happened to you.\nThank you.\nAre you going to say goodbye to her?\nSorry.\nYou call that a landing?\nHey, bub, I'm not finished with you yet.\nSo... couldn't wait to get my shirt off again.\nThis is mine!\nThat tickles.\nHey.\nHey!\nHow are you feeling?\nFantastic. \n\nGiven quotes from the character above, which of the following tropes would you say this character represents?\n\nA: Absent Minded Professor\nB: Adventurer Archaeologist\nC: Arrogant Kungfu Guy\nD: Big Man On Campus\nE: Bounty Hunter\nF: Brainless Beauty\nG: Broken Bird\nH: Bromantic Foil\nI: Bruiser With A Soft Center\nJ: Bully\nK: Byronic Hero\nL: Casanova\nM: Chanteuse\nN: Charmer\nO: Child Prodigy\nP: Classy Cat Burglar\nQ: Consummate Professional\nR: Corrupt Corporate Executive\nS: Coward\nT: Crazy Jealous Guy\nU: Crazy Survivalist\nV: Cultured Badass\nW: Dean Bitterman\nX: Dirty Cop\nY: Ditz\nZ: Doormat\nAA: Drill Sargeant Nasty\nAB: Dumb Blonde\nAC: Dumb Muscle\nAD: Eccentric Mentor\nAE: Egomaniac Hunter\nAF: Evil Prince\nAG: Fastest Gun In The West\nAH: Father To His Men\nAI: Final Girl\nAJ: Gadgeteer Genius\nAK: Gentleman Thief\nAL: Granola Person\nAM: Grumpy Old Man\nAN: Hardboiled Detective\nAO: Heartbroken Badass\nAP: Henpecked Husband\nAQ: Hitman With A Heart\nAR: Jerk Jock\nAS: Junkie Prophet\nAT: Klutz\nAU: Loser Protagonist\nAV: Loveable Rogue\nAW: Master Swordsman\nAX: Morally Bankrupt Banker\nAY: Officer And A Gentleman\nAZ: Ophelia\nBA: Playful Hacker\nBB: Prima Donna\nBC: Psycho For Hire\nBD: Pupil Turned To Evil\nBE: Retired Outlaw\nBF: Revenge\nBG: Romantic Runnerup\nBH: Self Made Man\nBI: Slacker\nBJ: Stoner\nBK: Storyteller\nBL: Stupid Crooks\nBM: Surfer Dude\nBN: The Chief\nBO: The Editor\nBP: Tranquil Fury\nBQ: Trickster\nBR: Valley Girl\nBS: Warrior Poet\nBT: Young Gun\n",

Welcome aboard!\nI'm here to find the man I love.\nI'm deeply flattered, son, but my first and only love is the sea.\nMeaning William Turner, Captain Sparrow.\nElizabeth!\nHide the rum.\nWhy is the rum always gone?\nOh... that's why.\nLand is where you are safe, Jack Sparrow, and so you will carry land with you.\nDirt. This is a jar of dirt.\nYes.\n...Is the jar of dirt going to help?\nIf you don't want it, give it back.\nNo!\nThen it helps.\n*Alas*, my children! This is the day you shall always remember as the day that you almost...\n...Captain Jack Sparrow.\nMy tremendous intuitive sense of the female creature informs me that you are troubled.\nYou want me to find this?\nNo. You want you to find this, because the finding of this finds you incapacitorially finding and or locating in your discovering the detecting of a way to save your dolly belle, ol' what's-her-face. Savvy?\nThis is going to save Elizabeth?\nHow much do you know about Davy Jones?\nNot much.\nYeah, it's going to save Elizabeth.\nHow did you get here?\nSea turtles, mate. A pair of them strapped to my feet.\nNot so easy, is it?\nYou look bloody awful, what are you doing here?\nYou hired me. I can't help it if your standards are lax.\nYou smell funny.\nSo, we're setting out to find whatever this key unlocks?\nNo. If we don't have the key, we can't open whatever we don't have that it unlocks. So what purpose would be served in finding whatever need be unlocked, which we don't have, without first having found the key what unlocks it?\nSo, we're setting out to find this key?\nNow you're not making any sense at all.\nIs this a dream?\nNo.\nI thought not. If it were, there'd be rum.\n\nLet's put some distance between us and this island and head out to open sea!\nYes to the first, yes to the second, but only insofar as we keep to the shallows as much as possible.\nThat seems a bit contradictory, Captain.\nI have every faith in your reconciliatory navigational skills, Mr. Gibbs, now where is that monkey, I want to shoot something!\nSo what's your plan, then?\nI row over, search the ship until I find your bloody key.\nAnd if there are crewmen?\nI cut down anyone in my path.\nI like it. Simple, easy to remember.\nDo excuse me while I kill the man who ruined my life.\nBe my guest.\nLet us examine that claim for a moment, former Commodore, shall we? Who was it that, at the very moment you had a notorious pirate safely behind bars, saw fit to free said pirate and take your dearly beloved all to hisself, eh? So whose fault is it *really* that you've ended up a rum-pot deckhand what takes orders from pirates?\nENOUGH!\nUnfortunately Mr. Turner, he's right!\nGuard the boat, mind the tide... don't touch my dirt.\nI wonder, Sparrow, can you live with this? Can you condemn an innocent man, a friend, to a lifetime of servitude in your name while you roam free?\nYep. I'm good with it.\nDarling, I am truly unhappy to have to tell you this, but through an unfortunate and entirely unforeseeable series of circumstances that had nothing whatsoever to do with me, poor Will has been press-ganged into Davy Jones's crew.\nYou have a debt to pay. You've been captain of the Black Pearl for thirteen years. That was our agreement.\nTechnically, I was only captain for two years, then I was viciously mutinied upon.\nThen you were a poor captain, but a captain nonetheless! Have you not introduced yourself all these years as \"Captain Jack Sparrow\"?\nWhere's the Commodore?\nHe fell behind.\nMy prayers be with him.\nBest not wallow in our grief!\nWe're not getting out of this.\nNot with the chest. Into the boat.\nYou're mad.\nDon't wait for me.\nUh, I say we respect his final wish.\nThe Black Spot!\nThe Black Spot!\nBlack Spot!\nMy eyesight's as good as ever, just so you know.\nThank you, Jack.\nWe're not free yet, love.\nYou came back. I always knew you were a good man.\nIt's after you, not the ship. It's not us. This is the only way, don't you see?\nI'm not sorry.\nPirate.\nIt's real!\nYou actually were telling the truth.\nI do that quite a lot. Yet people are always surprised.\nWith good reason.\nYou know I demand payment.\nI brought payment. Look.\nAn undead monkey! Top that!\n\nNo...\nYou've no idea how long it took us to catch that.\nThe payment is fair...\nNot quite according to plan...\nComplications arose, ensued, were overcome.\nOh bugger.\nSo am I worthy to serve under Captain Jack Sparrow...\n... or should I just kill you now?\nYou're hired!\nSorry. Old habits and all that.\nMr. Gibbs.\nCaptain.\nWe have a need to travel upriver.\nBy \"need,\" do you mean a trifling need? Fleeting? As in, say, a passing fancy?\nNo, a resolute and unyielding need.\nWe are very much alike, you and I, I and you... us.\nOh. Except for a sense of honor and decency and a moral center. And personal hygiene.\nTrifles.\nJack, the letters, give them back.\nNo. Persuade me.\nYou do know Will taught me how to handle a sword.\nAs I said, persuade me.\nJack's hat!\nClear about!\nNo, no! Leave it!\nRun!\nBack to yer stations, the lot o' ye!\nJack?\nShhh.\nFor the love of Mother and Child, Jack, what's coming after us?\nNothing.\nNot so bad...\nOh!\n'Ello, beastie.\nNo, no! More wood! Big fire! I am chief! Want big fire!\nYou mistrust me? Listen, you can mistrust him, trust me.\nYou know that don't do no good.\nIt does me.\nYou have a touch of destiny about you, William Turner.\nYou know me?\nYou want to know me.\nThere'll be no knowing here! We've come for help and were not leaving without it.\nI thought I knew you...\nNo worries! Tia Dalma and I go way back... thick as thieves, nigh inseparable we are... were... have been... before...\nI'll watch yer back.\nIt's me front I'm worried about.\nMind the boat.\nMind the boat.\nMind the boat.\nMind the boat.\nMind the boat.\nMind the boat.\nHow are we going?\nIncluding those four? That gives us... four.\nEr, Mr. Gibbs...\nAye.\nI feel sullied and unusual.\nMy compass is unique.\n*Unique* here having the meaning of *broken*?\nTrue enough.\nYou know, these clothes do not flatter you at all. It should be a dress or nothing. I happen to have no dress in my cabin.\nAh! A heading. Set sail in a... uh... a general... that way! direction.\nI want my jar of dirt!\nIt's funny what a man will do to forestall his final judgment.\nYou made a deal with him too, Jack. He raised the Pearl from the depths for you. Thirteen years you've been her captain.\nTechnically...\nYou won't be able to talk yourself out of this. The terms that apply to me apply to you as well. One soul, bound to crew a hundred years upon his ship.\nYes, but the Flying Dutchmen already has a captain, so there's really...\nThen it's the locker for you! Jones' terrible leviathan will find you, and drag the Pearl back to the depths and you along with it.\nAny idea when Jones might release said terrible beastie?\nI've already told you, Jack. Your time is up. He comes now.\nShe's only a ship, mate.\nTo what do I owe the pleasure of your carbuncle?\nHe sent me. Davy Jones.\nYou know of Davy Jones? A man of the sea, a great sailor. Until he run afoul of that which vexes all men.\nWhat vexes all men?\nWhat indeed.\nThe sea?\nSums?\nThe dichotomy of good and evil?\nA woman.\nA woman. He fell in love.\nNo, no, I heard it was the sea he fell in love with.\nSame story, different versions. And all are true. See, it was a woman as changing and harsh and untamable as the sea. Him never stopped loving her. But the pain it caused was to much to live with, but not enough to cause him to die.\nWhat exactly did he put into the chest?\nHim heart.\nLiterally or figuratively?\nHe couldn't literally put his heart in a chest. Could he?\nIt was not worth feeling what small, fleeting joy life brings.\nGentlemen, what do keys do?\nKeys... unlock... *things*?\nWalk the plank!\nWhat did the bird say?\nJack, Elizabeth is in danger!\nHave you considered keeping more watchful eye on her? Maybe just lock her up somewhere.\n'Ello beastie.\nYou know, Lizzie, I happen to be captain of a ship. And, as captain, I could perform... a mar-i-age. Right here, on this deck, right now.\nCan't let you do that, William. 'Cause if Jones is dead, who's to call his terrible beastie off the hunt, eh? Now, if you please. The key.\nI keep the promises I make, Jack. I intend to free my father. I hope you're here to see it.\nI can't let you do that, either. So sorry.\nI knew you'd warm up to me eventually.\nLord Beckett desires the contents of that chest. I deliver it, I get my life back.\nAh. The dark side of ambition.\nOh, I prefer to see it as the promise of redemption.\nHave you not met Will Turner? He's noble, heroic - terrific soprano. Worth at least four... maybe three and a half. And did I happen to mention... he's in love? With a girl. Due to be married. Betrothed. Dividing him from her and her from him would only be half as cruel as actually allowing them to be joined in holy matrimony, eh?\nOne word love: curiosity. You long for freedom. You long to do what you want to do because you want it. To act on selfish impulse. You want to see what it's like. One day you won't be able to resist.\nJones's terrible leviathan will find you, and drag the Pearl back to the depths and you along with it!\nAny idea when Jones might release said terrible beastie?\nI already told you, Jack. Your time is up.\nIt comes now, drawn with ravenous hunger to the man what bears the Black Spot.\nThe compass you bartered from me it cannot lead you to this?\nMaybe. Why?\nAh, Jack Sparrow does not know what he wants.\nWhy doesn't your compass work?\n...My compass works fine.\nSavvy?\nIt's a key!\nNo! Much more better. It is a *drawing* of a key.\nStill rooting for you, mate!\nLum se se, eunuch-y. Snip snip.\nThat's the Flying Dutchman? It doesn't look like much.\nNeither do you. Do not underestimate.\nWhere is it? Where is the thump-thump?\nYou already have my payment. One soul to serve on your ship is already over there.\nOne soul is not equal to another.\nAh-ha! So, we've established my proposal as sound in principle. Now, we're just haggling over price.\nAs you were, gents.\nThis... is going to save Elizabeth?\nHow much do you know about Davey Jones?\nNot much.\nYeah, it's gonna save Elizabeth.\nLeave 'im lie... unless you're planning to use him to hit somethin' with.\nGentlemen... what do keys do?\nKeys unlock... things?\nAnd whatever this key unlocks, inside there's something valuable. So we're setting out to find whatever this key unlocks!\nNo. If we don't have the key, we can't open whatever it is we don't have that it unlocks. So what purpose would be served in finding whatever need be unlocked, which we don't have, without first having found the key what unlocks it?\nSo we're going after this key!\nYou're not making any sense at all.\nDo we have a heading?\nAh! A heading! Set sail in a general...\n*That* way direction.\nIf we can outrun her, we can take her. We should turn and fight.\nWhy fight when you can negotiate?\nThere will come a time when you have a chance to do the right thing.\nI love those moments. I like to wave at them as they pass by.\nOi! Fishface! Lose something? Eh? Scungilli!\nGot it! Come to negotiate, eh? Have you, you slimy git? Look what I got.\nI got a jar of dirt, I got a jar of dirt, and guess what's inside it!\nCome to join my crew, lad? Welcome aboard!\nI'm here to find the man I love.\nI'm deeply flattered, son, but my first and only love is the sea.\nMeaning William Turner, Captain Sparrow.\nElizabeth!\nHide the rum.\nWhy is the rum always gone?\nOh... that's why.\nLand is where you are safe, Jack Sparrow, and so you will carry land with you.\nDirt. This is a jar of dirt.\nYes.\n...Is the jar of dirt going to help?\nIf you don't want it, give it back.\nNo!\nThen it helps.\n*Alas*, my children! This is the day you shall always remember as the day that you almost...\n...Captain Jack Sparrow.\nMy tremendous intuitive sense of the female creature informs me that you are troubled.\nYou want me to find this?\nNo. You want you to find this, because the finding of this finds you incapacitorially finding and or locating in your discovering the detecting of a way to save your dolly belle, ol' what's-her-face. Savvy?\nThis is going to save Elizabeth?\nHow much do you know about Davy Jones?\nNot much.\nYeah, it's going to save Elizabeth.\nHow did you get here?\nSea turtles, mate. A pair of them strapped to my feet.\nNot so easy, is it?\nYou look bloody awful, what are you doing here?\nYou hired me. I can't help it if your standards are lax.\nYou smell funny.\nSo, we're setting out to find whatever this key unlocks?\nNo. If we don't have the key, we can't open whatever we don't have that it unlocks. So what purpose would be served in finding whatever need be unlocked, which we don't have, without first having found the key what unlocks it?\nSo, we're setting out to find this key?\nNow you're not making any sense at all.\nIs this a dream?\nNo.\nI thought not. If it were, there'd be rum.\n\nLet's put some distance between us and this island and head out to open sea!\nYes to the first, yes to the second, but only insofar as we keep to the shallows as much as possible.\nThat seems a bit contradictory, Captain.\nI have every faith in your reconciliatory navigational skills, Mr. Gibbs, now where is that monkey, I want to shoot something!\nSo what's your plan, then?\nI row over, search the ship until I find your bloody key.\nAnd if there are crewmen?\nI cut down anyone in my path.\nI like it. Simple, easy to remember.\nDo excuse me while I kill the man who ruined my life.\nBe my guest.\nLet us examine that claim for a moment, former Commodore, shall we? Who was it that, at the very moment you had a notorious pirate safely behind bars, saw fit to free said pirate and take your dearly beloved all to hisself, eh? So whose fault is it *really* that you've ended up a rum-pot deckhand what takes orders from pirates?\nENOUGH!\nUnfortunately Mr. Turner, he's right!\nGuard the boat, mind the tide... don't touch my dirt.\nI wonder, Sparrow, can you live with this? Can you condemn an innocent man, a friend, to a lifetime of servitude in your name while you roam free?\nYep. I'm good with it.\nDarling, I am truly unhappy to have to tell you this, but through an unfortunate and entirely unforeseeable series of circumstances that had nothing whatsoever to do with me, poor Will has been press-ganged into Davy Jones's crew.\nYou have a debt to pay. You've been captain of the Black Pearl for thirteen years. That was our agreement.\nTechnically, I was only captain for two years, then I was viciously mutinied upon.\nThen you were a poor captain, but a captain nonetheless! Have you not introduced yourself all these years as \"Captain Jack Sparrow\"?\nWhere's the Commodore?\nHe fell behind.\nMy prayers be with him.\nBest not wallow in our grief!\nWe're not getting out of this.\nNot with the chest. Into the boat.\nYou're mad.\nDon't wait for me.\nUh, I say we respect his final wish.\nThe Black Spot!\nThe Black Spot!\nBlack Spot!\nMy eyesight's as good as ever, just so you know.\nThank you, Jack.\nWe're not free yet, love.\nYou came back. I always knew you were a good man.\nIt's after you, not the ship. It's not us. This is the only way, don't you see?\nI'm not sorry.\nPirate.\nIt's real!\nYou actually were telling the truth.\nI do that quite a lot. Yet people are always surprised.\nWith good reason.\nYou know I demand payment.\nI brought payment. Look.\nAn undead monkey! Top that!\n\nNo...\nYou've no idea how long it took us to catch that.\nThe payment is fair...\nNot quite according to plan...\nComplications arose, ensued, were overcome.\nOh bugger.\nSo am I worthy to serve under Captain Jack Sparrow...\n... or should I just kill you now?\nYou're hired!\nSorry. Old habits and all that.\nMr. Gibbs.\nCaptain.\nWe have a need to travel upriver.\nBy \"need,\" do you mean a trifling need? Fleeting? As in, say, a passing fancy?\nNo, a resolute and unyielding need.\nWe are very much alike, you and I, I and you... us.\nOh. Except for a sense of honor and decency and a moral center. And personal hygiene.\nTrifles.\nJack, the letters, give them back.\nNo. Persuade me.\nYou do know Will taught me how to handle a sword.\nAs I said, persuade me.\nJack's hat!\nClear about!\nNo, no! Leave it!\nRun!\nBack to yer stations, the lot o' ye!\nJack?\nShhh.\nFor the love of Mother and Child, Jack, what's coming after us?\nNothing.\nNot so bad...\nOh!\n'Ello, beastie.\nNo, no! More wood! Big fire! I am chief! Want big fire!\nYou mistrust me? Listen, you can mistrust him, trust me.\nYou know that don't do no good.\nIt does me.\nYou have a touch of destiny about you, William Turner.\nYou know me?\nYou want to know me.\nThere'll be no knowing here! We've come for help and were not leaving without it.\nI thought I knew you...\nNo worries! Tia Dalma and I go way back... thick as thieves, nigh inseparable we are... were... have been... before...\nI'll watch yer back.\nIt's me front I'm worried about.\nMind the boat.\nMind the boat.\nMind the boat.\nMind the boat.\nMind the boat.\nMind the boat.\nHow are we going?\nIncluding those four? That gives us... four.\nEr, Mr. Gibbs...\nAye.\nI feel sullied and unusual.\nMy compass is unique.\n*Unique* here having the meaning of *broken*?\nTrue enough.\nYou know, these clothes do not flatter you at all. It should be a dress or nothing. I happen to have no dress in my cabin.\nAh! A heading. Set sail in a... uh... a general... that way! direction.\nI want my jar of dirt!\nIt's funny what a man will do to forestall his final judgment.\nYou made a deal with him too, Jack. He raised the Pearl from the depths for you. Thirteen years you've been her captain.\nTechnically...\nYou won't be able to talk yourself out of this. The terms that apply to me apply to you as well. One soul, bound to crew a hundred years upon his ship.\nYes, but the Flying Dutchmen already has a captain, so there's really...\nThen it's the locker for you! Jones' terrible leviathan will find you, and drag the Pearl back to the depths and you along with it.\nAny idea when Jones might release said terrible beastie?\nI've already told you, Jack. Your time is up. He comes now.\nShe's only a ship, mate.\nTo what do I owe the pleasure of your carbuncle?\nHe sent me. Davy Jones.\nYou know of Davy Jones? A man of the sea, a great sailor. Until he run afoul of that which vexes all men.\nWhat vexes all men?\nWhat indeed.\nThe sea?\nSums?\nThe dichotomy of good and evil?\nA woman.\nA woman. He fell in love.\nNo, no, I heard it was the sea he fell in love with.\nSame story, different versions. And all are true. See, it was a woman as changing and harsh and untamable as the sea. Him never stopped loving her. But the pain it caused was to much to live with, but not enough to cause him to die.\nWhat exactly did he put into the chest?\nHim heart.\nLiterally or figuratively?\nHe couldn't literally put his heart in a chest. Could he?\nIt was not worth feeling what small, fleeting joy life brings.\nGentlemen, what do keys do?\nKeys... unlock... *things*?\nWalk the plank!\nWhat did the bird say?\nJack, Elizabeth is in danger!\nHave you considered keeping more watchful eye on her? Maybe just lock her up somewhere.\n'Ello beastie.\nYou know, Lizzie, I happen to be captain of a ship. And, as captain, I could perform... a mar-i-age. Right here, on this deck, right now.\nCan't let you do that, William. 'Cause if Jones is dead, who's to call his terrible beastie off the hunt, eh? Now, if you please. The key.\nI keep the promises I make, Jack. I intend to free my father. I hope you're here to see it.\nI can't let you do that, either. So sorry.\nI knew you'd warm up to me eventually.\nLord Beckett desires the contents of that chest. I deliver it, I get my life back.\nAh. The dark side of ambition.\nOh, I prefer to see it as the promise of redemption.\nHave you not met Will Turner? He's noble, heroic - terrific soprano. Worth at least four... maybe three and a half. And did I happen to mention... he's in love? With a girl. Due to be married. Betrothed. Dividing him from her and her from him would only be half as cruel as actually allowing them to be joined in holy matrimony, eh?\nOne word love: curiosity. You long for freedom. You long to do what you want to do because you want it. To act on selfish impulse. You want to see what it's like. One day you won't be able to resist.\nJones's terrible leviathan will find you, and drag the Pearl back to the depths and you along with it!\nAny idea when Jones might release said terrible beastie?\nI already told you, Jack. Your time is up.\nIt comes now, drawn with ravenous hunger to the man what bears the Black Spot.\nThe compass you bartered from me it cannot lead you to this?\nMaybe. Why?\nAh, Jack Sparrow does not know what he wants.\nWhy doesn't your compass work?\n...My compass works fine.\nSavvy?\nIt's a key!\nNo! Much more better. It is a *drawing* of a key.\nStill rooting for you, mate!\nLum se se, eunuch-y. Snip snip.\nThat's the Flying Dutchman? It doesn't look like much.\nNeither do you. Do not underestimate.\nWhere is it? Where is the thump-thump?\nYou already have my payment. One soul to serve on your ship is already over there.\nOne soul is not equal to another.\nAh-ha! So, we've established my proposal as sound in principle. Now, we're just haggling over price.\nAs you were, gents.\nThis... is going to save Elizabeth?\nHow much do you know about Davey Jones?\nNot much.\nYeah, it's gonna save Elizabeth.\nLeave 'im lie... unless you're planning to use him to hit somethin' with.\nGentlemen... what do keys do?\nKeys unlock... things?\nAnd whatever this key unlocks, inside there's something valuable.

A heading! Set sail in a general...\n*That* way direction.\nIf we can outrun her, we can take her. We should turn and fight.\nWhy fight when you can negotiate?\nThere will come a time when you have a chance to do the right thing.\nI love those moments. I like to wave at them as they pass by.\nOi! Fishface! Lose something? Eh? Scungilli!\nGot it! Come to negotiate, eh? Have you, you slimy git? Look what I got.\nI got a jar of dirt, I got a jar of dirt, and guess what's inside it!\nCome to join my crew, lad?

This is the only way, don't you see?\nI'm not sorry.\nPirate.\nIt's real!\nYou actually were telling the truth.\nI do that quite a lot. Yet people are always surprised.\nWith good reason.\nYou know I demand payment.\nI brought payment. Look.\nAn undead monkey! Top that!\n\nNo...\nYou've no idea how long it took us to catch that.\nThe payment is fair...\nNot quite according to plan...\nComplications arose, ensued, were overcome.\nOh bugger.\nSo am I worthy to serve under Captain Jack Sparrow...\n... or should I just kill you now?\nYou're hired!\nSorry. Old habits and all that.\nMr. Gibbs.\nCaptain.\nWe have a need to travel upriver.\nBy \"need,\" do you mean a trifling need? Fleeting? As in, say, a passing fancy?\nNo, a resolute and unyielding need.\nWe are very much alike, you and I, I and you... us.\nOh. Except for a sense of honor and decency and a moral center. And personal hygiene.\nTrifles.\nJack, the letters, give them back.\nNo. Persuade me.\nYou do know Will taught me how to handle a sword.\nAs I said, persuade me.\nJack's hat!\nClear about!\nNo, no! Leave it!\nRun!\nBack to yer stations, the lot o' ye!\nJack?\nShhh.\nFor the love of Mother and Child, Jack, what's coming after us?\nNothing.\nNot so bad...\nOh!\n'Ello, beastie.\nNo, no! More wood! Big fire! I am chief! Want big fire!\nYou mistrust me? Listen, you can mistrust him, trust me.\nYou know that don't do no good.\nIt does me.\nYou have a touch of destiny about you, William Turner.\nYou know me?\nYou want to know me.\nThere'll be no knowing here! We've come for help and were not leaving without it.\nI thought I knew you...\nNo worries! Tia Dalma and I go way back... thick as thieves, nigh inseparable we are... were... have been... before...\nI'll watch yer back.\nIt's me front I'm worried about.\nMind the boat.\nMind the boat.\nMind the boat.\nMind the boat.\nMind the boat.\nMind the boat.\nHow are we going?\nIncluding those four? That gives us... four.\nEr, Mr. Gibbs...\nAye.\nI feel sullied and unusual.\nMy compass is unique.\n*Unique* here having the meaning of *broken*?\nTrue enough.\nYou know, these clothes do not flatter you at all. It should be a dress or nothing. I happen to have no dress in my cabin.\nAh! A heading. Set sail in a... uh... a general... that way! direction.\nI want my jar of dirt!\nIt's funny what a man will do to forestall his final judgment.\nYou made a deal with him too, Jack. He raised the Pearl from the depths for you. Thirteen years you've been her captain.\nTechnically...\nYou won't be able to talk yourself out of this. The terms that apply to me apply to you as well. One soul, bound to crew a hundred years upon his ship.\nYes, but the Flying Dutchmen already has a captain, so there's really...\nThen it's the locker for you! Jones' terrible leviathan will find you, and drag the Pearl back to the depths and you along with it.\nAny idea when Jones might release said terrible beastie?\nI've already told you, Jack. Your time is up. He comes now.\nShe's only a ship, mate.\nTo what do I owe the pleasure of your carbuncle?\nHe sent me. Davy Jones.\nYou know of Davy Jones? A man of the sea, a great sailor. Until he run afoul of that which vexes all men.\nWhat vexes all men?\nWhat indeed.\nThe sea?\nSums?\nThe dichotomy of good and evil?\nA woman.\nA woman. He fell in love.\nNo, no, I heard it was the sea he fell in love with.\nSame story, different versions. And all are true. See, it was a woman as changing and harsh and untamable as the sea. Him never stopped loving her. But the pain it caused was to much to live with, but not enough to cause him to die.\nWhat exactly did he put into the chest?\nHim heart.\nLiterally or figuratively?\nHe couldn't literally put his heart in a chest. Could he?\nIt was not worth feeling what small, fleeting joy life brings.\nGentlemen, what do keys do?\nKeys... unlock... *things*?\nWalk the plank!\nWhat did the bird say?\nJack, Elizabeth is in danger!\nHave you considered keeping more watchful eye on her? Maybe just lock her up somewhere.\n'Ello beastie.\nYou know, Lizzie, I happen to be captain of a ship. And, as captain, I could perform... a mar-i-age. Right here, on this deck, right now.\nCan't let you do that, William. 'Cause if Jones is dead, who's to call his terrible beastie off the hunt, eh? Now, if you please. The key.\nI keep the promises I make, Jack. I intend to free my father. I hope you're here to see it.\nI can't let you do that, either. So sorry.\nI knew you'd warm up to me eventually.\nLord Beckett desires the contents of that chest. I deliver it, I get my life back.\nAh. The dark side of ambition.\nOh, I prefer to see it as the promise of redemption.\nHave you not met Will Turner? He's noble, heroic - terrific soprano. Worth at least four... maybe three and a half. And did I happen to mention... he's in love? With a girl. Due to be married. Betrothed. Dividing him from her and her from him would only be half as cruel as actually allowing them to be joined in holy matrimony, eh?\nOne word love: curiosity. You long for freedom. You long to do what you want to do because you want it. To act on selfish impulse. You want to see what it's like. One day you won't be able to resist.\nJones's terrible leviathan will find you, and drag the Pearl back to the depths and you along with it!\nAny idea when Jones might release said terrible beastie?\nI already told you, Jack. Your time is up.\nIt comes now, drawn with ravenous hunger to the man what bears the Black Spot.\nThe compass you bartered from me it cannot lead you to this?\nMaybe. Why?\nAh, Jack Sparrow does not know what he wants.\nWhy doesn't your compass work?\n...My compass works fine.\nSavvy?\nIt's a key!\nNo! Much more better. It is a *drawing* of a key.\nStill rooting for you, mate!\nLum se se, eunuch-y. Snip snip.\nThat's the Flying Dutchman? It doesn't look like much.\nNeither do you. Do not underestimate.\nWhere is it? Where is the thump-thump?\nYou already have my payment. One soul to serve on your ship is already over there.\nOne soul is not equal to another.\nAh-ha! So, we've established my proposal as sound in principle. Now, we're just haggling over price.\nAs you were, gents.\nThis... is going to save Elizabeth?\nHow much do you know about Davey Jones?\nNot much.\nYeah, it's gonna save Elizabeth.\nLeave 'im lie... unless you're planning to use him to hit somethin' with.\nGentlemen... what do keys do?\nKeys unlock... things?\nAnd whatever this key unlocks, inside there's something valuable. So we're setting out to find whatever this key unlocks!\nNo. If we don't have the key, we can't open whatever it is we don't have that it unlocks. So what purpose would be served in finding whatever need be unlocked, which we don't have, without first having found the key what unlocks it?\nSo we're going after this key!\nYou're not making any sense at all.\nDo we have a heading?\nAh! A heading! Set sail in a general...\n*That* way direction.\nIf we can outrun her, we can take her. We should turn and fight.\nWhy fight when you can negotiate?\nThere will come a time when you have a chance to do the right thing.\nI love those moments. I like to wave at them as they pass by.\nOi! Fishface! Lose something? Eh? Scungilli!\nGot it! Come to negotiate, eh? Have you, you slimy git? Look what I got.\nI got a jar of dirt, I got a jar of dirt, and guess what's inside it!\nCome to join my crew, lad? Welcome aboard!\nI'm here to find the man I love.\nI'm deeply flattered, son, but my first and only love is the sea.\nMeaning William Turner, Captain Sparrow.\nElizabeth!\nHide the rum.\nWhy is the rum always gone?\nOh... that's why.\nLand is where you are safe, Jack Sparrow, and so you will carry land with you.\nDirt. This is a jar of dirt.\nYes.\n...Is the jar of dirt going to help?\nIf you don't want it, give it back.\nNo!\nThen it helps.\n*Alas*, my children! This is the day you shall always remember as the day that you almost...\n...Captain Jack Sparrow.\nMy tremendous intuitive sense of the female creature informs me that you are troubled.\nYou want me to find this?\nNo. You want you to find this, because the finding of this finds you incapacitorially finding and or locating in your discovering the detecting of a way to save your dolly belle, ol' what's-her-face. Savvy?\nThis is going to save Elizabeth?\nHow much do you know about Davy Jones?\nNot much.\nYeah, it's going to save Elizabeth.\nHow did you get here?\nSea turtles, mate. A pair of them strapped to my feet.\nNot so easy, is it?\nYou look bloody awful, what are you doing here?\nYou hired me. I can't help it if your standards are lax.\nYou smell funny.\nSo, we're setting out to find whatever this key unlocks?\nNo. If we don't have the key, we can't open whatever we don't have that it unlocks. So what purpose would be served in finding whatever need be unlocked, which we don't have, without first having found the key what unlocks it?\nSo, we're setting out to find this key?\nNow you're not making any sense at all.\nIs this a dream?\nNo.\nI thought not. If it were, there'd be rum.\n\nLet's put some distance between us and this island and head out to open sea!\nYes to the first, yes to the second, but only insofar as we keep to the shallows as much as possible.\nThat seems a bit contradictory, Captain.\nI have every faith in your reconciliatory navigational skills, Mr. Gibbs, now where is that monkey, I want to shoot something!\nSo what's your plan, then?\nI row over, search the ship until I find your bloody key.\nAnd if there are crewmen?\nI cut down anyone in my path.\nI like it. Simple, easy to remember.\nDo excuse me while I kill the man who ruined my life.\nBe my guest.\nLet us examine that claim for a moment, former Commodore, shall we? Who was it that, at the very moment you had a notorious pirate safely behind bars, saw fit to free said pirate and take your dearly beloved all to hisself, eh? So whose fault is it *really* that you've ended up a rum-pot deckhand what takes orders from pirates?\nENOUGH!\nUnfortunately Mr. Turner, he's right!\nGuard the boat, mind the tide... don't touch my dirt.\nI wonder, Sparrow, can you live with this? Can you condemn an innocent man, a friend, to a lifetime of servitude in your name while you roam free?\nYep. I'm good with it.\nDarling, I am truly unhappy to have to tell you this, but through an unfortunate and entirely unforeseeable series of circumstances that had nothing whatsoever to do with me, poor Will has been press-ganged into Davy Jones's crew.\nYou have a debt to pay. You've been captain of the Black Pearl for thirteen years. That was our agreement.\nTechnically, I was only captain for two years, then I was viciously mutinied upon.\nThen you were a poor captain, but a captain nonetheless! Have you not introduced yourself all these years as \"Captain Jack Sparrow\"?\nWhere's the Commodore?\nHe fell behind.\nMy prayers be with him.\nBest not wallow in our grief!\nWe're not getting out of this.\nNot with the chest. Into the boat.\nYou're mad.\nDon't wait for me.\nUh, I say we respect his final wish.\nThe Black Spot!\nThe Black Spot!\nBlack Spot!\nMy eyesight's as good as ever, just so you know.\nThank you, Jack.\nWe're not free yet, love.\nYou came back. I always knew you were a good man.\nIt's after you, not the ship. It's not us.

Myself, the boy, two droids... and no questions asked.\nWhat is it? Some kind of local trouble?\nLet's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.\nYou don't believe in the Force, do you?\nKid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other, and I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen *anything* to make me believe that there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. 'Cause no mystical energy field controls *my* destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.\nGet in there, you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell!\nThey're gonna execute her! Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured. Now all you want to do is stay?\nMarching into a detention area is not what I had in mind.\nBut they're gonna kill her!\nBetter her than me!\nThis is some rescue! You came in here, but didn't you have a plan for getting out?\nHe's the brains, sweetheart!\nGreat shot, kid, that was one in a million!\nI don't what we're gonna do now. Even if I could take off, I could never get past the tractor beam.\nLeave that to me.\nDamn fool, I knew you were going to say that.\nWho's the more foolish? The fool, or the fool who follows him?\nI have you now!\nWhat?\nYAHOOO!\nLook out!\nYou're all clear, kid, now let's *blow* this thing and go home!\nOne thing's for sure, we're all gonna be a lot thinner.\nGot him! I got him!\nGreat, kid! Don't get cocky.\nGoing somewhere, Solo?\nYes, Greedo. I was just going to see your boss. Tell Jabba I've got his money.\nIt's too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jabba's put a price on your head so large, every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you. I'm lucky I found you first.\nYeah, but this time I've got the money.\nIf you give it to me, I might forget I found you.\nI don't have it with me. Tell Jabba...\nJabba's through with you! He has no use for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.\nEven I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice?\nYou can tell that to Jabba. At best, he may only take your ship.\nOver my dead body!\nThat's the idea... I've been looking forward to this for a long time.\nYeah, I'll bet you have.\nSorry about the mess.\nSo. You got your reward and you're just leaving, then?\nThat's right, yeah. Got some old debts I gotta pay off with this stuff. Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you? Why don't you come with us? You're pretty good in a fight. We could use you.\nCome on. Why don't you take a look around. You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you, you're turning your back on them.\nWhat good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station is not my idea of courage. It's more like, suicide.\nOkay. Take care of yourself Han. I guess that's what you're best at isn't it?\nHey, Luke. May the Force be with you.\nWhat're you looking at? I know what I'm doing.\nWell, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em.\nDon't everyone thank me at once.\nThis is *not* gonna work.\nWhy didn't you say so before?\nI *did* say so before.\nYou came in that thing? You're braver than I thought.\nNice! Come on.\nGarbage chute. Really wonderful idea. What an incredible smell you've discovered! Let's get out of here! Get away from there...\nNo, wait...!\nWill you forget it? I already tried it. It's magnetically sealed!\nPut that thing away, you're gonna get us all killed!\nAbsolutely, Your Worship. Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here! Now it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us.\nIt could be worse.\nIt's worse.\nGood against remotes is one thing. Good against the living, that's something else.\nStay sharp. There's two more coming in. They're gonna try and cut us off.\nWhy don't you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was fast!\nWatch your mouth, kid, or you're gonna find yourself floating home! We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose 'em.\nHere's where the fun begins.\nHow long before you can make the jump to light speed?\nIt'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.\nAre you kidding? At the rate they're gaining...?\nTraveling through hyperspace ain't like dusting crops, boy! Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star, or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it.\n... What's that flashing?\nWe're losing a deflector shield. Go strap yourselves in. I'm going to make the jump to light speed.\n\nGoing somewhere, Solo?\nYes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss.\nTell Jabba that I've got his money.\nIts too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jabba put a price on your head so large, every bounty hunter will be looking for you. I'm lucky I found you first.\nYeah, but this time, I've got the money.\nIf you give it to me, I might forget I found you.\nI don't have it WITH me.\nTell Jabba...\nJabba's through with you. He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an imperial cruiser.\nEven I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I have a choice.\nYou can tell that to Jabba. He may only take your ship.\nOver my dead body.\nThat's the idea. I've been looking forward to this for a long time.\nYes, I bet you have.\nSorry about the mess.\nThere's something alive in here.\nThat's your imagination.\nSomething just moved passed my leg.\nLook! Did you see that?\nWhat?\nWhat a piece of junk!\nShe'll make point five past lightspeed. She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've made a lot of special modifications myself.\nBoy, it's lucky you have these compartments.\nI use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them. This is ridiculous.\nCome on. Why don't you take a look around? You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them.\nWhat good's a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like... suicide.\nAll right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?\nHey, Luke... may the Force be with you.\nWhat're you lookin' at? I know what I'm doin'.\nYou know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.\nBring 'em on, I'd prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.\nMaster Luke, sir. Pardon me for asking, but what should R2 and I do if we're discovered here?\nLock the door.\nAnd hope they don't have blasters.\nThat isn't very reassuring.\nThey let us go. It was the only reason for the ease of our escape.\nEasy? You call that easy?\nThey're tracking us.\nNot this ship, sister.\nAt least the information in R2 is still intact.\nWhat's so important? What's he carrying?\nThe technical readouts of that battle station. I only hope that when the data's analyzed a weakness can be found. It's not over yet.\nSure hope the old man got that tractor beam out of commission, or this is gonna be a real short trip. Okay, hit it!\nJabba, you're a wonderful human being.\nNot a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You know, sometimes I amaze even myself.\nThat doesn't sound too hard.\nWhere are you taking this... thing?\nPrisoner transfer. Cell block 1138?\nI wasn't notified. I'll have to clear it.\nLook out he's loose!\nHe'll tear us all apart!\nI'll get him!\nWhere did you dig up that old fossil?\nBen is a great man.\nYeah, great at getting us into trouble.\nLooks like you've managed to cut off our only escape route.\nMaybe you'd like it back in your cell, your highness.\nWhat the hell are you doing?\nWell somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage, fly-boy!\nCan't get out that way.\nLooks like you've managed to cut off our only escape route.\nMaybe you'd like it back in your cell, your Highness.\nWhat kept you?\nWe, uh, ran into some old friends.\nSolo! Come out of there, Solo! Solo!\nRight here, Jabba.\nI've been waiting for you.\nHave you now.\nYou didn't think I was gonna run, did you?\nHan, my boy, you disappoint me. Why haven't you paid me? And why did you fry poor Greedo?\nLook, Jabba, next time you wanna talk to me, come see me yourself. Don't send one of these twerps.\nHan, I can't make exceptions. What if everyone who smuggled for me dropped their cargo at the first sign of an Imperial starship? It's not good for business.\nLook, Jabba, even I get boarded sometimes.\nDid you think I had a choice? But I got a nice easy charter now; I'll pay you back, plus a little extra. I just need a little more time.\nHan, my boy, you're the best smuggler I ever hired. So, for an extra twenty percent...\nFifteen, Jabba, and don't push it.\nOkay, fifteen percent. But if you fail me again, I'll put a price on your head so big, you won't be able to go near a civilized system.\nJabba, you're a wonderful human being.\nCome on.\nWhat the-? We've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower, some kind of asteroid collision. It's not on any of the charts!\nWhat's going on?\nOur position's correct, except... no Alderaan.\nWhat do you mean? Where is it?\nThat's what I'm trying to tell you, kid, it ain't there, it's been totally blown away.\n*What*? How?\nDestroyed by the Empire.\nThe entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet. It'd take a thousand ships, with more firepower than I've...\nUh, everything's under control. Situation normal.\nWhat happened?\nUh, we had a slight weapons malfunction, but uh... everything's perfectly all right now. We're fine. We're all fine here now, thank you. How are you?\nWe're sending a squad up.\nUh, uh... negative, negative. We had a reactor leak here now. Give us a few minutes to lock it down. Large leak, very dangerous.\nWho is this? What's your operating number?\nUh...\nBoring conversation anyway. LUKE, WE'RE GONNA HAVE COMPANY!\nWonderful girl. Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.\nShe's rich.\nRich?\nRich, powerful. Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be...\nWhat?\nWell, more wealth than you can imagine!\nI don't know, I can imagine quite a bit.\nHokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.\nLook, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight. I take orders from just one person: me.\nIt's a wonder you're still alive.\nWill someone get this big walking carpet out of my way?\nNo reward is worth this.\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrgh!\nHe made a fair move. Screaming about it can't help you.\nLet him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.\nBut sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.\nThat's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their sockets when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that.\nGrrf.\nI see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, R2: let the Wookiee win.\nIt's not over yet.\nIt is for me, sister. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.\nYou needn't worry about your reward. If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive.\nYour friend is quite the mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything. Or anybody.\nI care.\nSo, what do you think of her, Han?\nI'm tryin' not to, kid.\nGood.\nStill, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, whaddya think? You think a princess and a guy like me...\nNo.\nHan Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells me you're lookin' for passage to the Alderaan system?\nYes indeed, if it's a fast ship.\nFast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?\nShould I have?\nIt's the ship that made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs. I've outrun Imperial starships. Not the local bulk cruisers mind you, I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now. She's fast enough for you old man. What's the cargo?\nOnly passengers. Myself, the boy, two droids... and no questions asked.\nWhat is it?

It'd take a thousand ships, with more firepower than I've...\nNo! Stop, Chewie, stop! Chewie! Chewie this won't help me! Hey! Save your strength. There'll be another time. The Princess. You have to take care of her. You hear me? Huh?\nI love you.\nI know.\nWhy, you stuck up... half-witted... scruffy-looking... Nerf-herder!\nWho's scruffy-looking?\nSir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately 3,720 to 1.\nNever tell me the odds.\nYour Tauntaun will freeze before you reach the first marker!\nThen I'll see you in Hell!\nHey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help.\nWould you please stop calling me that?\nSure, Leia.\nYou make it so difficult sometimes.\nI do, I really do. You could be a little nicer, though. Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right.\nOccasionally, maybe... when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.\nScoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that.\nStop that.\nStop what?\nStop that. My hands are dirty.\nMy hands are dirty, too. What are you afraid of?\nAfraid?\nYou're trembling.\nI'm not trembling.\nYou like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren't enough scoundrels in your life.\nI happen to like nice men.\nI'm nice men.\nNo, you're not. You're...\nLet go.\nShh.\nLet go, please.\nDon't get excited.\nCaptain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited.\nSorry sweetheart. I haven't got time for anything else.\nWell Princess, it looks like you managed to keep me here a while longer.\nI had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for anyone to leave the system until they've activated the energy shield.\nThat's a good story. I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.\nI don't know where you get your delusions, laser brain.\nLaugh it up, fuzzball.\nSir. Sir, I've isolated the reverse, power flux coupling.\nThank you. Thank you very much.\nOh you're perfectly welcome, sir.\nYou're not actually going IN to an asteroid field?\nThey'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?\nThis may smell bad, kid, but it'll keep you warm until I get the shelter up... Ugh. And I thought they smelled bad on the *outside*.\nYou said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake, well, this could be it, sweetheart.\nI take it back.\nAfraid I was gonna leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?\nI'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.\nI can arrange that. You could use a good kiss.\nWould it help if I got out and pushed?\nIt might!\nThey're getting closer.\nOh, yeah? Watch this.\nWatch what?\nI think we're in trouble.\nIf I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to lightspeed!\nWe're in trouble!\nThe cave is collapsing.\nThis is no cave.\nEcho Three to Echo Seven. Han, old buddy, do you read me?\nLoud and clear, kid. What's up?\nWell, I finished my circle. I don't pick up any life readings.\nThere isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. Sensors are placed. I'm going back.\nRight. I'll see you shortly. There's a meteorite that hit the ground near here. I want to check it out. It won't take long.\nEither shut him up or shut him down!\nHan, we need you.\nWe need?\nYes.\nWell, what about YOU need?\nI need? I don't know what you are talking about.\nYou probably don't.\nAnd what precisely am I supposed to know?\nCome on you want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.\nYes, you're great help to us you're a natural leader.\nNo! That's not it. Come on.\nA-ha! Come on!\nYou're imagining things.\nAm I? Then why are you following me afraid I was gonna leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?\nI'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.\nI could arrange that!\nYou could use a good kiss!\nI hope you know what you're doing.\nYeah, me too.\nExcuse me sir, but might I inquire as to what's going on?\nWhy not?\nImpossible man.\nI had no choice. They arrived right before you did. I'm sorry.\nI'm sorry too.\nWe're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.\nI'm not going to argue with that.\nPulverized?\nHow ya feeling kid? You don't look so bad to me. You look strong enough to pull the ears off a gundark.\nThanks to you.\nThat's two you owe me junior.\nNo time to discuss this as a committee.\nI am not a committee!\nSir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable.\nNot entirely stable. I'm glad you're here to tell us these things. Chewie! Take the Professor in back and plug him into the hyperdrive!\nHurry up, goldenrod! Or you're gonna be a permanent resident!\nWhat's going on... Buddy?\nYou're being put into carbon-freeze.\nSir, If I may venture an opinion...\nI'm not really interested in your opinion 3PO.\nI feel terrible.\nI thought you knew this person.\n\nWell, that was a long time ago, I'm sure he's forgotten about that.\nWhat are you doing here?\nAh, repairs. I was hoping you could help me out.\nWhat have you done to my ship?\nYOUR ship? Hey, remember you lost her to me, fair and square.\nDeck officer! Deck officer!\nI love you.\nI know.\nIt's not my fault.\nHaving trouble with your droid?\nNo, no problem. Why?\nHorizontal boosters. Alluvial dampers? Ow! That's not it, bring me the Hydrospanner. I don't know how we're going to get out of this one.\nOW! Chewie!\nOOOOW!\nSorry, am I interrupting anything?\nNot really.\nYou look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us among the clouds.\nThank you.\nWould you join us for a little refreshment? Everyone's invited, of course.\nHaving trouble with your droid?\nNo, no problem.

At least, after somebody call... Skywalker.\nLuke?\nLord Vader has set a trap for him.\nAnd we're the bait.\nYeah? Well, he's on his way.\nPerfect. You fixed us all real good, didn't you? My friend?\nStop! I've done all I care. I'm sorry I couldn't do better, but I got my own problems.\nYeah...

    "37": "Some motherfuckers are always trying to ice-skate uphill.\nYou better wake up. The world you live in is just a sugar-coated topping! There is another world beneath it: the real world. And if you wanna survive it, you better learn to PULL THE TRIGGER!\nMother fucker! Are you out of your damn mind?\nThere are worse things out tonight than vampires.\nLike what?\nLike me.\nOK, Vampire Anatomy 101, crosses and holy water don't do dick so forget what you've seen in the movies. You use a wooden stake, silver or sunlight to kill them. You know how to use one of these?\nNo, but I'll damn sure learn quick.\nSafety's off, round's already chambered. Silver hollow-point bullets filled with garlic. You aim for the head or the heart. Anything else, its your ass.\nYou have a lot of love for him, don't you?\nWe have a good arrangement. He makes the weapons. I use them.\nStill heavy.\nBut, you're so big.\nLa Magra is coming! The Spirits of the Twelve will awaken the Blood God!\nAnd there is nothing you can do about it, Daywalker!\nIs that so?\nWell, that's what Frost says.\nYou give Frost a message from me. You tell him it's open season on all suckheads.\nOh, great. Now you're robbing him. You gonna rob me, too?\nHow do you think that we fund this organization, huh? We're not exactly the March of Dimes.\nYou're one of them, aren't you?\nNo, I'm something else.\nFrost is trying to trigger a fuckin' vampire apocalypse. There's some kind of vampire God he's trying to resurrect.\nLa Magra.\nYou're the key. He needs your blood. The blood of the day walker. You're the chosen one.\nHow you doing, chief?\nEasy.\nWouldn't want our little friend here to wind up in the back of a milk carton now, would we? It's nice to finally meet you, man. Had my eye on you for years. I know all about you. Your serum, Whistler. Everything.\nSunblock.\nHey, it's a start, right? The goal, of course, is to be like you - the Daywalker! You got the best of both worlds, don't you? All our strengths... none of our weaknesses.\nWell, maybe I don't see it that way.\nOh, so it's back to pretending we're human again? C'mon... spare me the Uncle Tom routine, okay? You can't keep denying what you are, man. You think the humans will ever accept a half-breed like you? They can't. They're afraid of you. And they should be. You're an animal, you're a fuckin' maniac! Look at 'em. They're cattle; pieces of meat. What difference does it make how their world ends? Plague... war... famine. Morality doesn't even enter into it. We're just a function of natural selection, man. The new race.\nLooks like your mascara's running.\nI'm offering you a truce. I want you with us.\nWhat... do you think I'm stupid?\n\"The Spirits of the Twelve will awaken La Magra.\"\nYou're familiar with the Blood God.\nFrost... you're nothing to me but another dead vampire.\nYou're an idiot, you know that? I came down here offering you an easy way out and you spit it right back in my fuckin' face!\nCareful!\nWhat do I care? They're nothing but cattle... just like you said.\nIf you wanna take the hard road, be my guest, pal. But I promise you by the time this is over, you're gonna wish they never cut you from your mother's...\nIs that you? He's here! He's here!\nThis must be Pearl. The record keeper.\nWait a minute! I'm coming with you.\nYou're useless.\nOh, lookie here.\nSilver. Nice craftsman ship, huh? Probably cost you a pretty penny. Now this here is a man who takes his job just a little too seriously, don't you think? Come to think of it, Blade, I owe you one.\nActually, if you want to get technical, Blade...\nI owe you two.\nOh, what's so funny, bright eyes?\nI'm expecting company.\nCatch you fuckers at a bad time?\nEric, I'm you mother. You wouldn't hurt your mother would you? Come here.\nI must release you.\nAaaaaahhhhhhhhh!\nFFFRRROOOOOOSSST!\nKill him.\nI need to get back to the lab, if I'm going to cure you.\nIt's not over. You keep your cure. There's still a war going on, and I have a job to do. You wanna help, make me a better serum.\nWe're gonna play a little game of twenty questions. Depending on how you answer, you may walk out of here with a tan?\nWhat's *that*?\nOh, that? Oh, it's nothing, it's routine research, heh, heh... Actually, it's a video game.\nThat musta hurt.\nIt's a fragment! A piece of the prophecy!\nWhat prophecy?\nOh, I'm not really sure. There's so many out...\nYou see the valets over there? They're vampires. So's the doorman... and the whore on the corner.\nHow can you tell?\nBy the way they move. The way they smell.\nUgh! What is this? Garlic?\nYeah, well he said it would work against vampires.\nVampires? Who said I was a vampire?\nNobody.\nGo fuck yourself!\nFuck me? No, you fuck this!\nI hear you been looking for me. I'm flattered.\nIt'll pass.\nI promise you, you'll be dead by dawn.\nCatch you at a bad time... comrade?\nQuinn. I'm gettin' a little tired of choppin' you up. Thought I might try fire for a change.\nYou used me as bait?\nGet over it.\nYou been listening in the whole time?\nKeeping radio contact.\nThink I'd let him run loose without a chaperon?\nKill him.\nWait. I oh you man. I got two new hands, and I don't know which one to kill you with.\nRawr.\nFFFRRROOOOOOSSST!\nKill him.\nSo, am I a prisoner here?\nNot at all. We just had to take certain precautions before we let you go. You got to understand, they're everwhere. Vampires. A Hominus Nocturna. We hunt them you see, moving from one city to the next, tracking their migrations. They're hard to kill. They tend to regenerate.\nAnd I'm supposed to believe all this?\nWell, you already met Mr. Crispy at the hospital. What do you think?\nRemember what we told you. You keep your eyes open. They're everywhere.\nIsn't this just a little high-tech?\nThey've got their claws into everything - politics, finance, real estate. They already own half of downtown.\nI'm not human.\nYou look human to me.\nHumans don't drink blood.\nThat was a long time abo. Maybe you should let that go?\nI have spent my whole life lookin' for that thing that killed my mother, and made me what I am. And every time I take one of those monsters out, I get a little piece of that life back.

Prepare to die.\nGive us the gate key.\nI have no gate key.\nFezzik, tear his arms off.\nOh, you mean *this* gate key.\nWho are you?\nNo one of consequence.\nI must know...\nGet used to disappointment.\n'kay.\nHE DIDN'T FALL? INCONCEIVABLE.\nYou keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.\nThat Vizzini, he can *fuss*.\nFuss, fuss... I think he like to scream at *us*.\nProbably he means no *harm*.\nHe's really very short on *charm*.\nYou have a great gift for rhyme.\nYes, yes, some of the time.\nEnough of that.\nFezzik, are there rocks ahead?\nIf there are, we all be dead.\nNo more rhymes now, I mean it.\nAnybody want a peanut?\nDYEEAAHHHHHH!\nBut, I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.\nThat's VERY comforting, but I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.\nI hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.\nNo good. I've known too many Spaniards.\nIsn't there any way you trust me?\nNothing comes to mind.\nI swear on the soul of my father, Domingo Montoya, you will reach the top alive.\nThrow me the rope.\nIs very strange. I have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over, I don't know what to do with the rest of my life.\nHave you ever considered piracy? You'd make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts.\nYou are wonderful.\nThank you; I've worked hard to become so.\nI admit it, you are better than I am.\nThen why are you smiling?\nBecause I know something you don't know.\nAnd what is that?\nI am not left-handed.\nYou are amazing.\nI ought to be, after 20 years.\nOh, there's something I ought to tell you.\nTell me.\nI'm not left-handed either.\nI donna suppose you could speed things up?\nIf you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope or a tree branch or find something useful to do.\nI could do that. I have some rope up here, but I do not think you would accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you.\nThat does put a damper on our relationship.\nI do not mean to pry, but you don't by any chance happen to have six fingers on your right hand?\nDo you always begin conversations this way?\nHello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\nHello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\nHello! My name is Inigo Montoya! You killed my father! Prepare to die!\nStop saying that!\nHELLO! MY NAME IS INIGO MONTOYA! YOU KILLED MY FATHER! PREPARE TO DIE!\nOffer me money.\nYes!\nPower, too, promise me that.\nAll that I have and more. Please...\nOffer me anything I ask for.\nAnything you want...\nI want my father back, you son of a bitch!\nHello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\nStop saying that!\nYou've done nothing but study swordplay?\nMore pursue than study lately. You see, I cannot find him... it's been twenty years now and I'm starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.\nWell I certainly hope you find him someday.\nYou are ready then?\nWhether I am or not, you've been more than fair.\nYou seem a decent fellow... I hate to kill you.\nYou seem a decent fellow... I hate to die.\nBegin.\nHe probably owes you money huh? I'll ask him.\nHe's dead. He can't talk.\nWhoo-hoo-hoo, look who knows so much. It just so happens that your friend here is only MOSTLY dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Mostly dead is slightly alive. With all dead, well, with all dead there's usually only one thing you can do.\nWhat's that?\nGo through his clothes and look for loose change.\nYou got any money?\nSixty-five.\nI've never worked for so little. Except once, and that was a very noble cause.\nThis is noble, sir. His wife is... crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation.\nAre you a rotten liar!\nI need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.\nYour first story was better.\nYou are using Bonetti's Defense against me, ah?\nI thought it fitting considering the rocky terrain.\nNaturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro?\nNaturally, but I find that Thibault cancels out Capo Ferro. Don't you?\nUnless the enemy has studied his Agrippa... which I have!\nWho are you? Are we enemies? Why am I on this wall? Where is Buttercup?\nLet me explain.\nNo, there is too much. Let me sum up. Buttercup is marry Humperdinck in little less than half an hour. So all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the princess, make our escape... after I kill Count Rugen.\nThat doesn't leave much time for dilly-dallying.\nYou just wiggled your finger. That's wonderful.\nI've always been a quick healer. What are our liabilities?\nThere is but one working castle gate, and... and it is guarded by 60 men.\nAnd our assets?\nYour brains, Fezzik's strength, my steel.\nAre you the Miracle Max who worked for the king all those years?\nThe King's stinking son fired me, and thank you so much for bringing up such a painful subject. While you're at it, why don't you give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it? We're closed.\nDo you hear that, Fezzik? That is the sound of ultimate suffering. My heart made that sound when Rugen slaughtered my father. The man in black makes it now.\nThe man in black?\nHis true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has the cause for ultimate suffering?\nYou never said anything about killing anyone.\nI've hired you to help me start a war. It's an prestigious line of work, with a long and glorious tradition.\nI just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.\nAm I going MAD, or did the word \"think\" escape your lips? You were not hired for your brains, you hippopotamic land mass.\nI agree with Fezzik.\nOh, the sot has spoken. What happens to her is not truly your concern. I will kill her. And remember this, never forget this: when I found you, you were so slobbering drunk, you couldn't buy brandy!\nAnd YOU: friendless, brainless, helpless, hopeless! Do you want me to send you back to where you were? Unemployed, in Greenland?\nInigo?\nWhat?\nI hope we win.\nMy father was slaughtered by a six-fingered man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. When the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He slaved a year before it was done.\nI've never seen its equal.\nThe six-fingered man returned and demanded it, but at one tenth his promised price. My father refused. Without a word, the six-fingered man slashed him through the heart. I loved my father. So naturally, I challenged his murderer to a duel. I failed. The six-fingered man left me alive, but he gave me these.\nHow old were you?\nI was eleven years old. And when I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the six-fingered man and say, \"Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\"\nYou know, Fezzik, you finally did something right.\nDon't worry, I won't let it go to my head.\nBut this is Buttercup's true love - If you heal him, he will stop Humperdinck's wedding.\nWait. Wait. I make him better, Humperdinck suffers?\nHumiliations galore!\nHA-HA-HA!\n*That* is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, I'm on the job.\nJump in after her!\nI don't swim\nI only dog paddle.\nAGGHH!\nYou are sure nobody's followed us?\nAs I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done, and no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?\nNo reason. It's only... I just happened to look behind us and something is there.\nWhat? Probably some local fisherman, out for a pleasure cruise, at night... in... eel-infested waters...\nExcuse me... Pardon me, please, it's important... Fezzik, please?\nEVERYBODY MOVE!\nThank you.\nWhere is the Man in Black?\nFezzik, jog his memory.\nSorry, Inigo. I didn't mean to jog him so hard.\nOh, what I wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.\nThere, we cannot help you.\nWill this do?\nWhere did you get that?\nAt Miracle Max's. It fits so nice, he said I could keep it.\nI mean, if we only had a wheelbarrow, that would be something.\nWhere we did we put that wheelbarrow the albino had?\nOver the albino, I think.\nWell, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place?\nHello there. Slow going?\nLook, I don't mean to be rude but this is not as easy as it looks, so I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.\nSorry.\nThank you.\nI am waiting for you, Vizzini!

Prepare to die.\nStop saying that!\nYou've done nothing but study swordplay?\nMore pursue than study lately. You see, I cannot find him... it's been twenty years now and I'm starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.\nWell I certainly hope you find him someday.\nYou are ready then?\nWhether I am or not, you've been more than fair.\nYou seem a decent fellow... I hate to kill you.\nYou seem a decent fellow... I hate to die.\nBegin.\nHe probably owes you money huh? I'll ask him.\nHe's dead. He can't talk.\nWhoo-hoo-hoo, look who knows so much. It just so happens that your friend here is only MOSTLY dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Mostly dead is slightly alive. With all dead, well, with all dead there's usually only one thing you can do.\nWhat's that?\nGo through his clothes and look for loose change.\nYou got any money?\nSixty-five.\nI've never worked for so little. Except once, and that was a very noble cause.\nThis is noble, sir. His wife is... crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation.\nAre you a rotten liar!\nI need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.\nYour first story was better.\nYou are using Bonetti's Defense against me, ah?\nI thought it fitting considering the rocky terrain.\nNaturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro?\nNaturally, but I find that Thibault cancels out Capo Ferro. Don't you?\nUnless the enemy has studied his Agrippa... which I have!\nWho are you? Are we enemies? Why am I on this wall? Where is Buttercup?\nLet me explain.\nNo, there is too much. Let me sum up. Buttercup is marry Humperdinck in little less than half an hour. So all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the princess, make our escape... after I kill Count Rugen.\nThat doesn't leave much time for dilly-dallying.\nYou just wiggled your finger. That's wonderful.\nI've always been a quick healer. What are our liabilities?\nThere is but one working castle gate, and... and it is guarded by 60 men.\nAnd our assets?\nYour brains, Fezzik's strength, my steel.\nAre you the Miracle Max who worked for the king all those years?\nThe King's stinking son fired me, and thank you so much for bringing up such a painful subject. While you're at it, why don't you give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it? We're closed.\nDo you hear that, Fezzik? That is the sound of ultimate suffering. My heart made that sound when Rugen slaughtered my father. The man in black makes it now.\nThe man in black?\nHis true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has the cause for ultimate suffering?\nYou never said anything about killing anyone.\nI've hired you to help me start a war. It's an prestigious line of work, with a long and glorious tradition.\nI just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.\nAm I going MAD, or did the word \"think\" escape your lips? You were not hired for your brains, you hippopotamic land mass.\nI agree with Fezzik.\nOh, the sot has spoken. What happens to her is not truly your concern. I will kill her. And remember this, never forget this: when I found you, you were so slobbering drunk, you couldn't buy brandy!\nAnd YOU: friendless, brainless, helpless, hopeless! Do you want me to send you back to where you were? Unemployed, in Greenland?\nInigo?\nWhat?\nI hope we win.\nMy father was slaughtered by a six-fingered man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. When the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He slaved a year before it was done.\nI've never seen its equal.\nThe six-fingered man returned and demanded it, but at one tenth his promised price. My father refused. Without a word, the six-fingered man slashed him through the heart. I loved my father. So naturally, I challenged his murderer to a duel. I failed. The six-fingered man left me alive, but he gave me these.\nHow old were you?\nI was eleven years old. And when I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the six-fingered man and say, \"Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\"\nYou know, Fezzik, you finally did something right.\nDon't worry, I won't let it go to my head.\nBut this is Buttercup's true love - If you heal him, he will stop Humperdinck's wedding.\nWait. Wait. I make him better, Humperdinck suffers?\nHumiliations galore!\nHA-HA-HA!\n*That* is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, I'm on the job.\nJump in after her!\nI don't swim\nI only dog paddle.\nAGGHH!\nYou are sure nobody's followed us?\nAs I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done, and no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?\nNo reason. It's only... I just happened to look behind us and something is there.\nWhat? Probably some local fisherman, out for a pleasure cruise, at night... in... eel-infested waters...\nExcuse me... Pardon me, please, it's important... Fezzik, please?\nEVERYBODY MOVE!\nThank you.\nWhere is the Man in Black?\nFezzik, jog his memory.\nSorry, Inigo. I didn't mean to jog him so hard.\nOh, what I wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.\nThere, we cannot help you.\nWill this do?\nWhere did you get that?\nAt Miracle Max's. It fits so nice, he said I could keep it.\nI mean, if we only had a wheelbarrow, that would be something.\nWhere we did we put that wheelbarrow the albino had?\nOver the albino, I think.\nWell, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place?\nHello there. Slow going?\nLook, I don't mean to be rude but this is not as easy as it looks, so I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.\nSorry.\nThank you.\nI am waiting for you, Vizzini! You told me to go back to the beginning... so I have.\nThis is where I am, this is where I'll stay. I will not be moved!\nHe's right on top of us.

All I have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward it I have now surpassed. My pain is constant and sharp, and I do not hope for a better world for anyone. In fact, I want my pain to be inflicted on others. I want no one to escape. But even after admitting this, there is no catharsis; my punishment continues to elude me, and I gain no deeper knowledge of myself. No new knowledge can be extracted from my telling. This confession has meant nothing.\nI like to dissect girls. Did you know I'm utterly insane?\nHoward, it's Bateman, Patrick Bateman. You're my lawyer so I think you should know: I've killed a lot of people. Some girls in the apartment uptown uh, some homeless people maybe 5 or 10 um an NYU girl I met in Central Park. I left her in a parking lot behind some donut shop. I killed Bethany, my old girlfriend, with a nail gun, and some man uh some old faggot with a dog last week. I killed another girl with a chainsaw, I had to, she almost got away and uh someone else there I can't remember maybe a model, but she's dead too. And Paul Allen. I killed Paul Allen with an axe in the face, his body is dissolving in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen. I don't want to leave anything out here. I guess I've killed maybe 20 people, maybe 40. I have tapes of a lot of it, uh some of the girls have seen the tapes. I even, um... I ate some of their brains, and I tried to cook a little. Tonight I, uh, I just had to kill a LOT of people. And I'm not sure I'm gonna get away with it this time. I guess I'll uh, I mean, ah, I guess I'm a pretty uh, I mean I guess I'm a pretty sick guy. So, if you get back tomorrow, I may show up at Harry's Bar, so you know, keep your eyes open.\nAsk me a question.\nSo, what do you do?\nI'm into, uh, well, murders and executions, mostly.\nDo you like it?\nWell, it depends. Why?\nWell, most guys I know who are in Mergers and Acquisitions really don't like it.\nDo you like Huey Lewis and The News?\nThey're OK.\nTheir early work was a little too new wave for my tastes, but when Sports came out in '83, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor.\nHey Halberstram.\nYes, Allen?\nWhy are there copies of the style section all over the place, d-do you have a dog? A little chow or something?\nNo, Allen.\nIs that a rain coat?\nYes it is! In '87, Huey released this, Fore, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is \"Hip to be Square\", a song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity, and the importance of trends, it's also a personal statement about the band itself.\nHey Paul!\nTRY GETTING A RESERVATION AT DORSIA NOW, YOU FUCKING STUPID BASTARD! YOU, FUCKING BASTARD!\nThere is an idea of a Patrick Bateman; some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me: only an entity, something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable... I simply am not there.\nYou're a fucking ugly bitch. I want to stab you to death, and then play around with your blood.\nI live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I'm 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine. In the morning if my face is a little puffy I'll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.\nI'm fucking serious. It's fucking over, us, this is no joke. I don't think we should see each other any more.\nBut your friends are my friends and my friends are your friends. I really don't think it would work. You have a little something...\nI know that your friends are my friends and, uh... I've thought about that. You can have 'em.\nWould you like to hear today's specials?\nNot if you want to keep your spleen.\nDo you know what Ed Gein said about women?\nEd Gein? The maitre 'd at Canal Bar?\nNo, serial killer, Wisconsin, the '50s.\nSo what did he say?\n\"When I see a pretty girl walking down the street, I think two things. One part wants me to take her out, talk to her, be real nice and sweet and treat her right.\"\nAnd what did the other part think?\n\"What her head would look like on a stick... \"\nI have all the characteristics of a human being: blood, flesh, skin, hair; but not a single, clear, identifiable emotion, except for greed and disgust. Something horrible is happening inside of me and I don't know why. My nightly bloodlust has overflown into my days. I feel lethal, on the verge of frenzy. I think my mask of sanity is about to slip.\nWhat's that?\nDuct tape. I need it for... taping something.\nNot the face! You bitch! Not the fucking face, you piece of bitch trash!\nDo you like Phil Collins? I've been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before that, I really didn't understand any of their work. Too artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins' presence became more apparent. I think Invisible Touch was the group's undisputed masterpiece. It's an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time, it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums. Christy, take off your robe. Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance of every instrument. Sabrina, remove your dress. In terms of lyrical craftsmanship, the sheer songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism. Sabrina, why don't you, uh, dance a little. Take the lyrics to Land of Confusion. In this song, Phil Collins addresses the problems of abusive political authority. In Too Deep is the most moving pop song of the 1980s, about monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything I've heard in rock. Christy, get down on your knees so Sabrina can see your asshole. Phil Collins' solo career seems to be more commercial and therefore more satisfying, in a narrower way. Especially songs like In the Air Tonight and Against All Odds. Sabrina, don't just stare at it, eat it. But I also think Phil Collins works best within the confines of the group, than as a solo artist, and I stress the word artist. This is Sussudio, a great, great song, a personal favorite.\nNew card. What do you think?\nWhoa-ho. Very nice. Look at that.\nPicked them up from the printer's yesterday.\nGood coloring.\nThat's bone. And the lettering is something called Silian Rail.\nIt's very cool, Bateman, but that's nothing. Look at this.\nThat is really nice.\nEggshell with Romalian type. What do you think?\nNice.\nJesus. That is really super. How'd a nitwit like you get so tasteful?\nI can't believe that Bryce prefers Van Patten's card to mine.\nBut wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet. Raised lettering, pale nimbus. White.\nImpressive. Very nice.\nHmm.\nLet's see Paul Allen's card.\nLook at that subtle off-white coloring. The tasteful thickness of it. Oh, my God. It even has a watermark.\nIs something wrong, Patrick? You're sweating.\nHey, I'm a child of divorce, gimme a break!\nYou're inhuman.\nNo... I'm in touch with humanity.\nI'm on a diet.\nWhat, you're kidding, right? You look great... so fit... and thin.\nWell, you can always be thinner... look better.\nThen maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I wouldn't want you to lose your willpower.\nThat's okay. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.\nCome on, Bryce. There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about.\nLike what?\nWell, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world hunger. We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless, and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights, while also promoting equal rights for women. We have to encourage a return to traditional moral values. Most importantly, we have to promote general social concern and less materialism in young people.\nPatrick. How thought-provoking.\nThere is a moment of sheer panic when I realize that Paul's apartment overlooks the park... and is obviously more expensive than mine.\nHe was into that whole Yale thing.\nYale thing?\nYeah, Yale thing.\nWhat whole Yale thing?\nWell, for one thing, I think he was probably a closet homosexual who did a lot of cocaine. That whole Yale thing.\nI think, um, Evelyn that, uh, we've lost touch.\nWhy? What's wrong?\nMy need to engage in homicidal behaviour on a massive scale cannot be corrected but, uh, I have no other way to fulfill my needs.\nDon't you want to know what I do?\nNo. No, not really.\nWell, I work on Wall Street... for Pierce & Pierce. Have you heard of it?\nYou have a really nice place here, Paul. How much did you pay for it?\nWell, actually, that's none of your business, Christie. But I can assure you, it certainly wasn't cheap.\nWhere are you going?\nI am just leaving.\nBut where?\nI have to return some videotapes.\nI don't want to get you drunk, but, ah, that's a very fine Chardonnay you're not drinking.\nPatrick? Is that you?\nNo Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.\nLook at that subtle off-white coloring. The tasteful thickness of it. Oh my God, it even has a watermark!\nThey don't have a good bathroom to do coke in.\nAre you sure that's Paul Allen over there?\nYes. McDufus, I am.\nHe's handling the Fisher account.\nLucky bastard.\nLucky Jew bastard.\nJesus, McDermott, what does that have to do with anything?\nI've seen that bastard sitting in his office, talking on the phone to the CEOs, spinning a fucking menorah.\nNot a menorah. You spin a dreidel.\nOh, my God. Bateman, do you want me to fry you up some fucking potato pancakes? Some latkes?\nNo. Just cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks.\nOh, I forgot. Bateman's dating someone from the ACLU.\nThe voice of reason... the boy next door.\nSpeaking of reasonable, only $570...\nI know my behavior can be... *erratic* sometimes.\nHuey Lewis and the News. Great stuff! I just bought it on my way here. You heard it?\nNever. I mean I don't really like singers.\nNot a big music fan, huh?\nNo, I like music. Just they're... Huey's too black sounding for me.\nPatrick, where did you get that overnight bag?\nJean Paul Gaultier.\nThousands of roses and lots of chocolate truffles. Godiva, and oysters in the half-shell.\nI'm trying to listen to the new Robert Palmer tape, but Evelyn, my supposed fiancée, keeps buzzing in my ear.\nAnnie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll have to get someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.\nDo what?\nGet married. Have a wedding.\nNo, I can't take the time off work.\nYour father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.\nI don't want to talk about it.\nYou hate that job anyway. I don't see why you just don't quit.\nBecause I want to fit in.\nEvelyn, I'm sorry. I just, uh... you're not terribly important to me.\nI think if you stay, something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you. You don't want to get hurt, do you?\nNo. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised.\nI'm on the verge of tears by the time we arrive at Espace, since I'm positive we won't have a decent table. But we do, and relief washes over me in an awesome wave.\nWhat are you so fucking zany about?\nI'm just a happy camper! Rockin' and a-rollin'!\nPaul Allen has mistaken me for this dickhead Marcus Halberstram. It seems logical because Marcus also works at P&P; and in fact does the same exact thing I do and he also has a penchant for Valentino suits and Oliver Peoples glasses. Marcus and I even go to the same barber, although I have a slightly better haircut.\nYou're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?\nIf they have a great personality and they're not great looking... then who fucking cares?\nWell, let's just say hypotetically ok? What if they have a great personality?\nI know, I know.\n, , :\nThere are no girls with good personalities.\n, , :\nThere are no girls with good personalities.\n, , :\nThere are no girls with good personalities.\nA good personality consists of a chick with a little hard body, who will satisfy all sexual demands without being too slutty about things, and who essentially will keep her dumb fucking mouth shut.\nThe only girls with good personalities who are smart or maybe funny or halfway intelligent or talented, though god knows what the fuck that means, are ugly chicks.\nAbsolutely.\nAnd this is because they have to make up for how fucking unnattractive they are.\nStop it, I'm...\non a lot of lithium?\nAre you dating anyone?\nMaybe. I don't know... Not really.\nPumpkin, you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York. Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.\nPatrick, stop calling me pumpkin, OK?\nListen, you'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at the Four Seasons in 20 minutes.\nI'm leaving. I've assessed the situation, and I'm going.\nHamilton, have a holly-jolly Christmas.\nDon't touch the watch.\nDid you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP, called simply Whitney Houston had 4 number one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie?\nYou actually listen to Whitney Houston? You own a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?\nIt's hard to choose a favorite among so many great tracks, but \"The Greatest Love of All\" is one of the best, most powerful songs ever written about self-preservation, dignity. Its universal message crosses all boundaries and instills one with the hope that it's not too late to better ourselves. Since, Elizabeth, it's impossible in this world we live in to empathize with others, we can always empathize with ourselves. It's an important message, crucial really. And it's beautifully stated on the album.\nIt's a fucking milligram of sweetener. I want to get high off this, not sprinkle it on my fucking oatmeal.\nDefinitely weak, but I have a feeling that if we do enough of it we'll be okay.\nWill you keep it down? I'm trying to do drugs!\nFuck you! Calm down. Let's do it anyway. That is if the FAGGOT in the next stall thinks it's okay!\nFUCK YOU!\nHEY FUCK YOU! Sorry, dude. Steroids. Okay, let's do it.\nYour compliment was sufficient, Luis.\n'Oh Africa Brave Africa'. It was... a laugh riot.\nNot quite blonde, are we? More of a dirty blonde.\nThis is really a beehive of, uh, activity, Halberstam. This place is hot, very hot.\nListen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here.\nYeah, well. You're late.\nHey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break.\nHmmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime Jell-O.\nIs that Ivana Trump over there? Jeez, Patrick, I mean Marcus, what are you thinking? Why would Ivana be at Texarkana?\nNow, John, you've to wear clothes in proportion to your physique. There are definite dos and don'ts, good buddy of wearing a bold striped shirt. A bold stripe shirt calls for solid colored or discreetly patterned suits and ties.\nYes, always tip the stylist 15%. Listen, John, I've gotta go, T. Boone Pickens just walked in.\nJust joking. No, don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay John? Right? Got it.\nHi, this is Paul Allen. I'm being called away to London for a few days. Meredith, I'll call you when I get back. Hasta la vista, baby.\nMistletoe alert!\nI'm fairly certain that Timothy Bryce and Evelyn are having an affair. Timothy is the only interesting person I know. I'm almost completely indifferent as to whether Evelyn knows I'm having an affair with Courtney Rawlinson, her closest friend. Courtney is almost perfect looking. She's usually operating on one or more psychiatric drugs; tonight I believe it's Xanax. More disturbing than the drug use, though, is the fact that she's engaged to Luis Carruthers, the biggest dufus in the business.\nDid you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie?\nWho's Ted Bundy?\nWhen I get to Paul Allen's place, I use the keys I took from his pocket. There is a moment of sheer panic when I realize that Paul's apartment overlooks the park and is obviously more expensive than mine. I calm myself and move into the bedroom, where I find his suitcase and start to pack.\nThat's a very fine chardonnay you're drinking. I want you to clean your vagina.\nWhat about the past?\nWe never really shared one.\nListen Patrick, can we talk?\nYou look... marvelous. There's nothing to say.\nThe world just opens up and swallows them.\nEerie. Very eerie.\nWe're not through yet.\nI killed Paul Allen. And I liked it.\nI'm sorry. I should've made an appointment. Was that anything important?\nOh, that? Just mulling over business problems, examining opportunities, exchanging rumors, spreading gossip.\nFace it. The Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the 90's.\nShut up, Carnes. They will not.\nSo, Harold, did you get my message?\nJesus, yes! That was hilarious! That was you, wasn't it?\nYeah, naturally.\nBateman killing Allen and the escort girls. That's fabulous. That's rich.\nWhat exactly do you mean?\nThe message you left. By the way, Davis, how's Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?\nW-w-wait, Harold. What do you mean?\nExcuse me. Nothing. It's good to see you.\nIs that Edward Towers?\nWait, um...\nDavis, I'm not one to badmouth anyone. Your joke was amusing, but come on, man. You had one fatal flaw. Bateman is such a dork. Such a boring spineless lightweight.\nNow if you said Bryce or McDermott... Otherwise, it was amusing. Now if you'll excuse me, I really must be going.\nWait, um... stop.\nI did it, Carnes. I killed him. *I'm* Patrick Bateman. I chopped Allen's fucking head off.\nThe whole message I left on your machine was true.\nExcuse me. I really must be going now.\nNo, listen! Don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis. I'm Patrick Bateman.\nWe talked on the phone all the time. Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.\nNow, Carnes, listen. Listen very, very carefully... I killed Paul Allen, and I liked it.\nI can't make myself any clearer.\nBut that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.\nIt never was supposed to be. Why isn't it possible?\nIt's just not.\nWhy not, you stupid bastard?\nBecause I had dinner with Paul Allen twice in London, just 10 days ago.\nNo, you...\n... didn't.\nNow if you'll excuse me.\nNew York Matinee called it \"a playful but mysterious little dish\".\nI'm not here.\nGet a god-damn job Al.\nMake someone happy. Have you ever wanted to?\nI'm looking for, uh...\nI guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.\nJust say no.\nWasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?\nWell, Halberstram, I could tell you... but then I'd have to kill ya.\nHe makes himself out to be a harmless old codger, but inside... inside...\n... \"but inside\" doesn't matter.\n\"Inside,\" yes, \"inside... \" - believe it or not, Bryce, we're actually listening to you...\nCome on, Bateman, what do you think?\nWhatever.\nYou hate that job anyway. I don't see why you don't just quit.\nBecause I want to fit in.\nJean, I'm not going to make it... I'm not going to... make it... to the office this afternoon.\nWhat is it, Patrick? Are you all right?\nStop sounding so fucking... sad! *Jesus*!\nAnd where did he go to school?\nDon't you know all this?\nI just wanted to know if you know.\nDo you take credit card? Just joking.\nYou saw the ad in the Times?\nNo... Yeah, I mean yeah, in the Times.\nThere was no ad in the Times. I think you should go now.\nI hope I'm not being cross-examined here.\nDo you feel that way?\nNo, not really.\nWhat do you do?\nShe's my... cousin.\nMm-hmm.\nShe's from... France.\nIf you don't shut your fucking mouth, I will kill you.\nWill you call me before Easter?\nMaybe.\nJust cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks.\nPumpkin, you're dating an asshole.\nNegative. Cancel it.\nWhat's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.\nI just have some questions about Paul Allen and yourself.\nCoffee?\nNo, I'm okay.\nApollinaris?\nNo, I'm okay.\nCan you bring Mr...?\nKimball.\nMr. Kimball a bottle of Apollinaris. It's no problem.\nSo, what's the topic of discussion?\nWhat are those?\nOh, uh, it's - cranberry juice. Uh, cran-apple. \n\nGiven quotes from the character above, which of the following tropes would you say this character represents?\n\nA: Absent Minded Professor\nB: Adventurer Archaeologist\nC: Arrogant Kungfu Guy\nD: Big Man On Campus\nE: Bounty Hunter\nF: Brainless Beauty\nG: Broken Bird\nH: Bromantic Foil\nI: Bruiser With A Soft Center\nJ: Bully\nK: Byronic Hero\nL: Casanova\nM: Chanteuse\nN: Charmer\nO: Child Prodigy\nP: Classy Cat Burglar\nQ: Consummate Professional\nR: Corrupt Corporate Executive\nS: Coward\nT: Crazy Jealous Guy\nU: Crazy Survivalist\nV: Cultured Badass\nW: Dean Bitterman\nX: Dirty Cop\nY: Ditz\nZ: Doormat\nAA: Drill Sargeant Nasty\nAB: Dumb Blonde\nAC: Dumb Muscle\nAD: Eccentric Mentor\nAE: Egomaniac Hunter\nAF: Evil Prince\nAG: Fastest Gun In The West\nAH: Father To His Men\nAI: Final Girl\nAJ: Gadgeteer Genius\nAK: Gentleman Thief\nAL: Granola Person\nAM: Grumpy Old Man\nAN: Hardboiled Detective\nAO: Heartbroken Badass\nAP: Henpecked Husband\nAQ: Hitman With A Heart\nAR: Jerk Jock\nAS: Junkie Prophet\nAT: Klutz\nAU: Loser Protagonist\nAV: Loveable Rogue\nAW: Master Swordsman\nAX: Morally Bankrupt Banker\nAY: Officer And A Gentleman\nAZ: Ophelia\nBA: Playful Hacker\nBB: Prima Donna\nBC: Psycho For Hire\nBD: Pupil Turned To Evil\nBE: Retired Outlaw\nBF: Revenge\nBG: Romantic Runnerup\nBH: Self Made Man\nBI: Slacker\nBJ: Stoner\nBK: Storyteller\nBL: Stupid Crooks\nBM: Surfer Dude\nBN: The Chief\nBO: The Editor\nBP: Tranquil Fury\nBQ: Trickster\nBR: Valley Girl\nBS: Warrior Poet\nBT: Young Gun\n",
    "42": "I ain't fightin' this war for you, sir.\nI see.\nI mean, what's the point? Ain't nobody gonna win. It's just gonna go on and on.\nCan't go on forever.\nYeah, but ain't nobody gonna win, sir.\nSomebody's gonna win.\nWho? I mean, you get to go on back to Boston, big house and all that. What about us? What do we get?\nWell, you won't get anything if we lose.\nIf you men will take no pay, then none of us will.\nThey've done it.\nAssemble the men.\nIn accordance with President Lincoln's wishes, you men are advised that the Confederate Congress has issued a proclamation. It reads: 'Any negro taken in arms against the Confederacy will immediately be returned to a state of slavery. Any negro taken in Federal uniform will be summarily put to death. Any white officer taken in command of negro troops shall be deemed as inciting servile insurrection and shall likewise be put to death.' Full discharges will be granted in the morning to all those who apply. Dismissed.\nIf you're not here in the morning, I'll understand.\nStill want that blue suit, nigger?\nSo what do you want to do?\nDon't know, sir.\nIt stinks, I suppose.\nYeah, It stinks bad. And we all covered up in it too. Ain't nobody clean. Be nice to get clean, though.\nHow do we do that?\nWe ante up and kick in, sir. But I still don't want to carry your flag.\nWhy do you treat the men this way, Robert?\nHow should I treat them?\n...Like men?\nIf this man should fall, who will lift the flag and carry on?\nI will.\nI'll see you in the fort, Thomas.\nOh, what do we have here? Bonnie Prince Charley and his toy bayonet! You're not reading your books now. Stab me.\nWhat?\nStab-me.\nI said STAB, not TICKLE! Come on, you prissy little schoolgirl! You're the worst soldier in this whole company, now HIT ME!\nNo shame, son, get up... I SAID GET UP!\nNigger forgot to duck, that's all!\nSergeant, deal with that man!\nI ain't sure I'm wantin' this, Colonel.\nI know exactly how you feel.\nNever, question my authority in front of others\nWell I is sorry, mas'sa. You be the boss-man now and all us chill'ins must learn your ways.\nMr. Rawlins... this morning, I... it would be a great help to me if I could talk to you from time to time about the men. That's all.\nShoes, sir.\n\nThe men need shoes, Colonel.\nYes, I've been after the quartermaster for some time.\nNo, sir. Now. That boy ran off to find him some shoes, Colonel. He wants to fight. Same as the rest of us. More, even.\nWe fight for men and women whose poetry is not yet written but which will presently be as enviable and as renowned as any.\nThere's more to fighting than rest, sir. There's character, there's strength of heart. You should have seen us in action two days ago. We were a sight to see! We'll be ready, sir. When do you want us?\nRobert Gould Shaw, the son of wealthy Boston abolitionists, was 23 years old when he enlisted to fight in the War Between the States. He wrote home regularly, telling his parents of life in the gathering Army of the Potomac. / These letters are collected in the Houghton Library of Harvard University.\nDear Mother, I hope you are keeping well and not worrying much about me. You mustn't think that any of us are going to be killed. They are collecting such a force here, that an attack would be insane. The Massachusetts men passed though here this morning; how grand it is to meet the men from all the States, east and west, ready to fight for their country, as the old fellows did in the Revolution. But this time we must make it a whole country for all who live here, so that all can speak.\nSgt. Mulcahy!\nSir!\nI have no doubt you a fair man, Mulcahy. I wonder if you are treating the men a little hard.\nYou may speak freely.\nThe boy is a friend of yours, is he?\nYes, we grew up together\nLet him grow up some more.\nThe town is clean sir. Ain't no rebs here, just some women.\nYou hear that! Let's clear er out!\nWhat are you doing?\nLiberating this town in the name of the Republic.\nMorning, Colonel. Change your mind about that bottle?\nI want 600 pairs of shoes and 1200 pairs of socks... and anything else you've been holding out on us, you piece of rat filth!\nI don't have any.\nNot for niggers you don't!\nNot for anybody.\nI see. I'll just look around to see if you haven't misplaced them!\nHEY!\nYou son of a bitch!\nGoddamn it, you can't...!\nCan't I? I'm a colonel, you nasty little cuss! You think you can keep 700 Union soldiers without proper shoes because you think it's *funny*? Now, where would that power come from?\nGood morning gentlemen, I am Colonel Robert Gould Shaw. I am your commanding officer. It is a great pleasure to see you all here today. It is my hope that the same courage, spirit, and honor, which has brought us together, will one day restore this Union. May God bless us all.\nPrepare your men to light torches!\nI will not!\nThat is an order!\nAn immoral order, and by the Articles of War, I am not bound to follow it!\nThen, you can explain that at your court-martial... after your men are placed under my command!\nGlory hallelujah.\nGot some letters here, personal things. Also, if I should fall, remember what you see here.\nDear Mother, They learn, learn quickly, faster than white troops it seems to me. They are almost grave and sedate under instruction and they restrain themselves. But the moment they are dismissed from drill every tongue is relaxed and every ivory tooth is visible and you would not know from the sound of it that this is an army camp. They must have learned this from long hours of meaningless, inhuman work oo set them free so quickly. It gives them great energy.

Ox, it's me, Indy. Ox? Ox, you're faking it, right?\n\"Through eyes that last I saw in tears...\"\nOx, listen to me, pal. Your name is Harold Oxley. You were born in Leeds, England. You and I went to school together at the University of Chicago. And you were never *this* interesting.\nYou're not the man I knew ten years ago.\nIt's not the years, honey, it's the mileage.\nMeet me at Omar's. Be ready for me. I'm going after that truck.\nHow?\nI don't know, I'm making this up as I go!\nDo we need the monkey?\nI'm surprised at you. Talking that way about our baby. He's got your looks, too.\nAnd your brains.\nYes she does! She's very smart.\nYou want to talk to God? Let's go see him together, I've got nothing better to do.\nWhat a fitting end to your life's pursuits. You're about to become a permanent addition to this archaeological find. Who knows? In a thousand years, even you may be worth something.\nHa ha ha ha.\nSon of a bitch.\nThere's a big snake in the plane, Jock!\nOh, that's just my pet snake Reggie.\nI hate snakes, Jock! I hate 'em!\nCome on! Show a little backbone, will ya!\nIndy, why does the floor move?\nGive me your torch.\nSnakes. Why'd it have to be snakes?\nAsps... very dangerous. You go first.\nMarion's the least of your worries right now, believe me, Indy.\nWhat do you mean?\nWell, I mean that for nearly three thousand years man has been searching for the lost ark. It's not something to be taken lightly. No one knows its secrets. It's like nothing you've ever gone after before.\nOh, Marcus. What are you trying to do, scare me? You sound like my mother. We've known each other for a long time. I don't believe in magic, a lot of superstitious hocus pocus. I'm going after a find of incredible historical significance, you're talking about the boogie man. Besides, you know what a cautious fellow I am.\nI can only say I'm sorry so many times.\nWell, say it again anyway!\nSorry.\nWe have top men working on it right now.\nWho?\nTop... men.\nWhiskey\nHow odd that it should end this way for us after so many stimulating encounters. I almost regret it. Where shall I find a new adversary so close to my own level?\nTry the local sewer.\nGive me the whip.\nThrow me the idol.\nNo time to argue! Throw me idol, I'll throw you the whip!\nGive me the whip!\nAdiós, señor.\nThe Ark of the Covenant, the chest that the Hebrews used to carry around the Ten Commandments.\nWhat, you mean THE Ten Commandments?\nYes, the actual Ten Commandments, the original stone tablets that Moses brought down from Mt. Horeb and smashed, if you believe in that sort of thing...\nDidn't any of you guys ever go to Sunday school?\nIndy, there is something that troubles me.\nWhat is it?\nThe Ark. If it is there, at Tanis, then it is something that man was not meant to disturb. Death has always surrounded it. It is not of this earth.\nHe said you were a bum.\nAw, he's being generous.\nThe most gifted bum he ever trained. You know, he loved you like a son... took a hell of a lot for you to alienate him.\nNot much... just you.\nMarion, don't look at it. Shut your eyes, Marion. Don't look at it, no matter what happens!\nHere, take this,\nWave it at anything that slithers.\nThe whole place is slitherin'!\nIndy!\n\nYou and I are very much alike. Archeology is our religion, yet we have both fallen from the pure faith. Our methods have not differed as much as you pretend. I am but a shadowy reflection of you. It would take only a nudge to make you like me. To push you out of the light.\nNow you're getting nasty.\nHello, Marion.\nIndiana Jones. I always knew some day you'd come walking back through my door. I never doubted that. Something made it inevitable. So, what are you doing here in Nepal?\nI need one of the pieces your father collected.\nI've learned to hate you in the last ten years!\nI never meant to hurt you.\nI was a child. I was in love. It was wrong and you knew it!\nYou knew what you were doing.\nNow I do. This is my place. Get out!\nBelloq.\nGood afternoon, Doctor Jones.\nI oughta kill you right now.\nNot a very private place for a murder.\nLet us hurry. There is nothing to fear here.\nThat's what scares me.\nWell, Jones, at least you haven't forgotten how to show a lady a good time.\nBoy, you're something!\nYeah? I'll tell you what: until I get back my five thousand dollars, you're gonna get more than you bargained for. I'm your goddamn partner!\nIndy, you have no time. If you still want the ark, it is being loaded onto a truck for Cairo.\nTruck? What truck?\nWhere'd you get that?\nFrom him.\nWho 'him'?\nKatanga. I got a feeling I'm not the first woman to travel with these pirates.\nStay here.\nIf you insist, señor.\nHowever, an Egyptian pharaoh...\nShishak.\n...yes, invaded the city of Jerusalem round about 980 B.C., and he may have take the Ark back to the city of Tanis and hidden it in a secret chamber called The Well of Souls.\nSecret chamber?\nHowever, about a year after the pharaoh had returned to Egypt, the city of Tanis was consumed by the desert in a sand storm which lasted a whole year. Wiped clean by the wrath of God.\nUh... huh.\nObviously, we've come to the right men. Now you seem to know, uh, all about this Tanis, then.\nNo, no, not really. Ravenwood is the real expert. Abner did the first serious work on Tanis. Collected some of its relics. It was his obsession, really. But he never found the city.\nFrankly, we're somewhat suspicious of Mr. Ravenwood, an American being mentioned so prominently in a secret Nazi cable.\nOh, rubbish. Ravenwood's no Nazi.\nWell, what do the Nazis want him for then?\nWell, obviously, the Nazis are looking for the headpiece to Staff of Ra and they think Abner's got it.\nWhat exactly is a headpiece to the Staff of Ra?\nWell, the staff is just a stick. I don't know, about this big. Nobody really knows for sure how high. And it's...\nit's, uh... it's capped with an elaborate headpiece in the shape of the sun with a crystal in the center. And what you did was, you take the staff to a special room in Tanis, a map room with a miniature of the city all laid out on the floor. And if you put the staff in a certain place at a certain time of day, the sun shone through here and made beam that came down on the floor here... and gave you the exact location of the Well of the Souls.\nWhere the Ark of the Covenant was kept, right?.\nThat's exactly what the Nazis are looking for.\nNow what does this Ark look like?\nUh... there's a picture of it right here.\nThat's it.\nGood God!\nYes, that's just what the Hebrews thought.\nUh, now what's that supposed to be coming out of there?\nLightning. Fire. Power of God or something.\nI'm beginning to understand Hitler's interest in this.\nOh, yes. The Bible speaks of the Ark leveling mountains and laying waste to entire regions. An army which carries the Ark before it... is invincible.\nNow, what's that supposed to be coming out of there?\nLightning. Fire. The power of God or something.\nI'm beginning to understand Hitler's interest in this.\nToo bad the Hovitos don't know you the way I do, Belloq.\nYes, too bad. You could warn them... if only you spoke Hovitos!\nBalloq's medallion only had writing on one side? You sure about that?\nPositive!\nBalloq's staff is too long.\n, :\nThey're digging in the wrong place!\n, :\nThey're digging in the wrong place!\nAdios, Satipo...\nDoctor Jones, we've heard a lot about you.\nHave you?\nProfessor of Archeology, expert on the occult, and how does one say it... obtainer of rare antiquities.\nThat's one way of saying it. Why don't you sit down, you'll be more comfortable.\nYes, you're a man of many talents.\nNow, you studied under Professor Ravenwood at the University of Chicago.\nYes, I did.\nYou have no idea of his present whereabouts?\nOnly rumors, really. Somewhere in Asia, I think. I haven't really spoken to him in ten years. We were friends once, but we had a bit of a falling out, I'm afraid.\nNow, Doctor Jones, you must understand that this is all completely confidential.\nI understand.\nYesterday afternoon, our European section intercepted a German communique that was sent from Cairo to Berlin.\nYou see, for the last two years, the Nazis have had teams of archaeologists running around the world looking for all sorts of religious artifacts. Hitler's a nut on the subject. He's crazy. He's obsessed with the occult. And right now, apparently, there is some kind of German archaeological dig going on in the desert outside Cairo.\nNow, we have some information here, but we can't make anything out of it and maybe you can. \"Tanis development proceeding. Acquire headpiece, Staff of Ra, Abner Ravenwood, US.\"\nThe Nazis have discovered Tanis!\nNow just what does that mean to you... 'Tanis'?\nTanis is one of the possible resting places of the Lost Ark.\nThe Lost Ark?\nYeah, the Ark of the Covenant. The chest the Hebrews used to carry the Ten Commandments around in.\nAlright now, what do you mean the Ten Commandments, you're talking about THE Ten Commandments?\nYes, the actual Ten Commandments. The original stone tablets that Moses brought down out of Mount Horeb and smashed, if you believe in that sort of thing. Didn't you guys ever go to Sunday School? Look, the Hebrews took the broken pieces and put them into the Ark. When they settled in Canaan, they put the Ark in a place called The Temple of Solomon, where it stayed for many years, till all of a sudden... whoosh, it was gone.\nWhere?\nNobody knows where or when.\nThis site also demonstrates one of the great dangers of archaeology; not to life and limb, although that does sometimes take place. I'm talking about folklore.\nI'm gonna blow up the Ark, Rene.\nYour persistence surprises even me. You're going to give mercenaries a bad name.\nHey, what happened? You don't look very happy.\nFools. Bureaucratic fools!\nWhat'd they say?\nThey don't know what they've got there.\nWell, I know what I've got here. Come on. I'll buy you a drink. You know, a drink?\nThis is it... This is where Forrestal cashed in.\nA friend of yours?\nA competitor... he was good. He was very good.\nThis were the old way, this says \"six Kadan height - \"\nAbout seventy-two inches.\nWait!\n\"And take back one Kadan, to honor the Hebrew God whose ark this is.\"\nDoctor Jones, surely you don't think you can escape from this island?\nThat depends on how reasonable we're all willing to be. All I want is the girl.\nAnd if we refuse?\nThen your Führer has no prize.\nI knew the Germans had hired you, Sallah. You're the best digger in Egypt.\nMy services are entirely inconsequential to them. They hired or shanghaied every digger in Cairo. The excavation is enormous. They hire only strong backs and they pay pennies for them. It's as if the pharaohs have returned.\nWow! Holy Smoke! Crash landing!\nShort Round, step on it.\nOkey dokey, Dr. Jones.\nHold on to your potatoes!\nFor crying out loud, there's a *kid* driving the car!\nRelax, I've been giving him lessons.\nWillie, Willie, Willie. What kind of a name is that? Is it short for something?\nWillie is my professional name, Indiana.\nHey, lady! You call him Dr. Jones!\n*My* professional name.\nWear your jewels to bed Princess?\nYeah... and nothing else. Shock you?\nNothing shocks me. I'm a scientist.\nOh, shit.\nMola Ram! Prepare to meet Kali... in Hell!\nWillie, we-are-going-to-DIE!\nAre you trying to develop a sense of humor or am I going deaf?\nYou're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!\nMaybe. But not today.\nShorty!\nHang on lady, we going for a ride!\nOh... my... God! Oh my God... Oh my God...\nIs he nuts?\nHe no nuts, he's crazy!\nWhat is Sankara?\nFortune and glory, kid. Fortune and glory.\nI hate the water... and I hate being wet... and I hate YOU!\nGOOD!\nKali Ma protects us! We are her children! We pledge our devotion to her with an offering of flesh... and blood!\nWhere's the antidote?\nOh, listen, I just met you! Oh, I'm not that kind of girl...\nHey, Dr. Jones, no time for love. We've got company.\nDr Jones, wasn't it the Sultan of Madagascar who threatened to cut off your head if you ever returned to his country?\nNo, it wasn't my head.\nThen your hands, perhaps?\nNo, it wasn't my hands. It was my...\nMy misunderstanding.\nWhat a vivid imagination.\n\"Palace slave\"...\n\"Nocturnal activities\"...\n*I'm* a conceited ape?\n\"I'll tell you in the morning\"...\nI can't believe this.\nHe's not coming.\nShe's not coming.\nI can't believe I'm not going.\nYou know how to fly, don't you?\nUm, no.

It's me.\nWhat's that?\nAntidote.\nTo what?\nThe poison you just drank.\nCaptain Blumburtt was just telling me something of the interesting history of the palace; the importance it played in the mutiny.\nIt seems the British never forget the mutiny of 1857.\nYes, well you know I think there were other events before the mutiny going back a century - back to the time of Clive that are more interesting.\nAnd what events are those Dr Jones?\nWell, if memory serves me correctly this area, this province was the centre eventuity of the Thuggee.\nDr Jones, you know perfectly well that the Thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a century.\nYes, of course. The Thuggee was an obscenity that worshipped Kali with human sacrifices. The British Army Knights did away with them.\nWell, I suppose stories of the Thuggee die hard.\nThere are no stories anymore.\nI'm not so sure. We came from a small village; peasants there told us Pankot Palace was growing powerful again because of some ancient evil.\nVillage stories, Dr Jones. They're just fear and folklore; you're beginning to worry Captain Blumburtt.\nNot worried, Mr Prime Minister, just erm... just erm... interested.\nYou know, the villagers also told us Pankot Palace had taken something.\nDr Jones, in our country it's not usual for a guest to insult his host.\nI'm sorry. I thought we were talking about folklore.\nWhat exactly was it they say was stolen?\nA sacred rock.\nHah! You see, Captain? A rock.\nSomething connected - the villager's rock and the old legend of the Sankara stones.\nDr Jones, we're all vulnerable to vicious rumour. I seem to remember that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than an archaeologist.\nWell, the newspapers greatly exaggerated the incident.\nAnd wasn't it the Sultana Madagascar who threatened to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?\nNo, it wasn't my head.\nThen your hands, perhaps?\nNo, it wasn't my hands... it was my\n... misunderstanding.\nYou want the stones, let 'em go!\nLet 'em go!\nDrop them, Dr. Jones! They will be found! You won't!\nSo what are you supposed to be, a lion tamer?\nI'm allowing you to tag along. So why don't you give your mouth a rest. Okay doll?\nWhat do you mean \"tag along\"? Ever since you got into my club, you haven't been able to take your eyes off of me.\nOh, yeah?\nStop! Look, just - stand against the wall, will ya?\nYou say to stand against the wall! I listen to what you say! Not my fault! Not my fault!\nThe biggest trouble with her is the noise.\nYou know what your problem is, Princess? You're too used to getting your own way.\nAnd you're too proud to admit that you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones!\nIf you want me Willie, you know where to find me.\nFive minutes. You'll be back over here in five minutes.\nI'll be asleep in five minutes.\nFive. You know it, and I know it.\nYou betrayed Shiva!\nWhere's my gun? WHERE'S MY GUN?\nI burned by fingers and I cracked a nail!\nAren't you gonna introduce us?\nThis is Willie Scott; this is Indiana Jones, a famous archaeologist.\nWell I always thought that archaeologists were always funny looking men going around looking for their mommies.\nMummies.\nOoh, what big birds!\nThose aren't big birds, sweetheart! They're giant vampire bats!\nSo it's true? You've found Nurhachi?\nYou know I did. Last night one of your boys tried to get Nurhachi without paying for him.\nYou have insulted my son.\nNo, you have insulted me. I spared his life.\nFeels like I step on fortune cookie!\nIt's not fortune cookies. Let me take a look.\nThat no cookie!\nShorty, where's my razor?\nWe're in trouble!\nTrouble? What kind of trouble?\nIt's a long story. Better hurry up or you won't get to hear it.\nStay behind me, Short Round. Step where I step, and don't touch anything.\nI step where you step! I touch nothing!\nAnything can happen. It's a long way to Delhi.\nNo, thanks. No more adventures with you, Dr. Jones.\nSweetheart, after all the fun we've had together?\nIf you think I'm going to Delhi with you, or anyplace else after all the trouble you've gotten me into, think again, buster! I'm going home to Missouri where they never feed you snakes before ripping your heart out and lowering you into hot pits! This is NOT my idea of a swell time!\nExcuse me, sir. I need a guide to Delhi. If you could...\nOh...\nVery funny. Very funny.\nUh-oh!\nYou never told me you spoke my language, Doctor Jones.\nOnly on special occasions.\nI was happy in Shanghai! I had a little house, and a garden! My friends were rich, we went to parties all the time in limousines! I *hate* being outside!\nI'm a singer! I could lose my voice!\nI think we'll camp here tonight.\nI've got something for you.\nThere's nothing you have that I could possibly want.\nRight.\nYou're a very nice man.\nI suggest you give me what you owe me... or 'Anything Goes!'\nFive minutes...\nFour and a half...\nWe weren't brought here. Our plane crashed.\nIt crashed.\nNo, no, no. We prayed to Shiva to help us find the stone. It was Shiva who made you fall from sky. So you will go to Pankot Palace... and find Shivalinga... and bring back to us. Bring back to us. Bring back to us.\nThe antidote!\nWhere's the diamond?\nYou could have kept it.\nNah, it would of just been another rock collecting dust.\nYeah, but it would have given you your fortune and glory.\nIf I have offended you, I am sorry. \n\nGiven quotes from the character above, which of the following tropes would you say this character represents?\n\nA: Absent Minded Professor\nB: Adventurer Archaeologist\nC: Arrogant Kungfu Guy\nD: Big Man On Campus\nE: Bounty Hunter\nF: Brainless Beauty\nG: Broken Bird\nH: Bromantic Foil\nI: Bruiser With A Soft Center\nJ: Bully\nK: Byronic Hero\nL: Casanova\nM: Chanteuse\nN: Charmer\nO: Child Prodigy\nP: Classy Cat Burglar\nQ: Consummate Professional\nR: Corrupt Corporate Executive\nS: Coward\nT: Crazy Jealous Guy\nU: Crazy Survivalist\nV: Cultured Badass\nW: Dean Bitterman\nX: Dirty Cop\nY: Ditz\nZ: Doormat\nAA: Drill Sargeant Nasty\nAB: Dumb Blonde\nAC: Dumb Muscle\nAD: Eccentric Mentor\nAE: Egomaniac Hunter\nAF: Evil Prince\nAG: Fastest Gun In The West\nAH: Father To His Men\nAI: Final Girl\nAJ: Gadgeteer Genius\nAK: Gentleman Thief\nAL: Granola Person\nAM: Grumpy Old Man\nAN: Hardboiled Detective\nAO: Heartbroken Badass\nAP: Henpecked Husband\nAQ: Hitman With A Heart\nAR: Jerk Jock\nAS: Junkie Prophet\nAT: Klutz\nAU: Loser Protagonist\nAV: Loveable Rogue\nAW: Master Swordsman\nAX: Morally Bankrupt Banker\nAY: Officer And A Gentleman\nAZ: Ophelia\nBA: Playful Hacker\nBB: Prima Donna\nBC: Psycho For Hire\nBD: Pupil Turned To Evil\nBE: Retired Outlaw\nBF: Revenge\nBG: Romantic Runnerup\nBH: Self Made Man\nBI: Slacker\nBJ: Stoner\nBK: Storyteller\nBL: Stupid Crooks\nBM: Surfer Dude\nBN: The Chief\nBO: The Editor\nBP: Tranquil Fury\nBQ: Trickster\nBR: Valley Girl\nBS: Warrior Poet\nBT: Young Gun\n",

    "46": "Fasten your seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy night!\nBill's thirty-two. He looks thirty-two. He looked it five years ago, he'll look it twenty years from now. I hate men.\nFunny business, a woman's career - the things you drop on your way up the ladder so you can move faster. You forget you'll need them again when you get back to being a woman. That's one career all females have in common, whether we like it or not: being a woman. Sooner or later, we've got to work at it, no matter how many other careers we've had or wanted. And in the last analysis, nothing's any good unless you can look up just before dinner or turn around in bed, and there he is. Without that, you're not a woman. You're something with a French provincial office or a book full of clippings, but you're not a woman. Slow curtain, the end.\nSo many people know me. I wish I did. I wish someone would tell me about me.\nYou're Margo, just Margo.\nAnd what is that, besides something spelled out in light bulbs, I mean - besides something called a temperament, which consists mostly of swooping about on a broomstick and screaming at the top of my voice? Infants behave the way I do, you know. They carry on and misbehave - they'd get drunk if they knew how - when they can't have what they want, when they feel unwanted or insecure or unloved.\nNice speech, Eve. But I wouldn't worry too much about your heart. You can always put that award where your heart ought to be.\nBirdie, you don't like Eve, do you?\nYou looking for an answer or an argument?\nAn answer.\nNo.\nWhy not?\nNow you want an argument.\nI shall never understand the weird process by which a body with a voice suddenly fancies itself as a mind. Just when exactly does an actress decide they're HER words she's speaking and HER thoughts she's expressing?\nUsually at the point where she has to rewrite and rethink them, to keep the audience from leaving the theatre!\nLloyd, honey, be a playwright with guts. Write me one about a nice normal woman who just shoots her husband.\nI'll admit I may have seen better days, but I'm still not to be had for the price of a cocktail, like a salted peanut.\nYou bought the new girdles a size smaller, I can feel it.\nSomething maybe grew a size larger.\nWhen we get home you're going to get into one of those girdles and act for two and a half hours.\nI couldn't get into the girdle in two and a half hours.\nI detest cheap sentiment.\nA Hollywood movie star just arrived.\nShucks, and I sent my autograph book to the cleaner.\nYou know, there isn't a playwright in the world who could make me believe this would happen between two adult people. Goodbye, Margo.\nBill? Where are you going? To find Eve?\nThat suddenly makes the whole thing believable.\nThere's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know she ordered domestic gin by mistake?\nThe only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests. They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns!\nThis is my cue to take you in my arms and reassure you. But I'm not going to - I'm too mad.\nGuilty!\nMad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous, on stage and off. I love you for some of them, in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughingly called our environment. You have to keep your teeth sharp - all right - but I will not have you sharpen them on me, or on Eve!\nWhat about her teeth? What about her fangs?\nShe hasn't cut them yet, and you know it! So when you start judging an idealistic, dreamy-eyed kid by the barroom Benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society, I won't have it! Eve Harrington has never, by word, look, thought, or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love. And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me - it spells a paranoiac insecurity that you should be ashamed of!\nCut! Print it! What happens in the next reel? Do I get dragged off screaming to the snake pits?\nHow about calling it a night?\nAnd you pose as a playwright? A situation pregnant with possibilities and all you can think of is everybody go to sleep.\nHave you no human consideration?\nShow me a human, and I might have!\nWe have to go to City Hall for the marriage license and blood test.\nI'd marry you if it turned out you had no blood at all.\nDon't get up. And please stop acting as if I were the queen mother.\nI'm sorry, I...\nOutside of a beehive, Margo, your behavior would not be considered either queenly or motherly.\nYou are in a beehive, pal. Didn't you know? We are all busy little bees, full of stings, making honey day and night. Aren't we honey?\nThank you, Eve. I'd like a martini, very dry.\nI'll get it.\nWhat'll you have?\nA milkshake?\nA martini, very dry, please.\nWhy so remote Addison? I should think you'd be at your protégé's side lending her moral support.\nMiss Casswell at the moment is where I can lend no support, moral or otherwise.\nIn the lady's, shall we say, lounge?\n...being violently ill to her tummy.\nHeaven help me. I love a psychotic!\nYou have every reason for happiness.\nExcept happiness!\nI love you, Max. I really mean it. I love you. Come to the pantry.\nShe loves me like a father. Also, she's loaded.\nAs it happens, there are particular aspects of my life to which I would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges.\nFor instance what?\nFor instance: you!\nYou're not much of a bargain, you know. You're conceited and thoughtless and messy.\n\"Don't let it worry you\", said the camera man, \"Even De Mille couldn't see anything looking through the wrong end!\" So that was the first and last...\nDon't let me kill the point. Or isn't it a story for grownups?\nYou've heard it - about the time I looked into the wrong end of the camera finder.\nRemind me to tell you about the time I looked into the heart of an artichoke.\nI'd like to hear it.\nSome snowy night, in front of the fire.\nMargo Channing is ageless - spoken like a press agent.\nI know what I'm talking about. After all, they're my plays.\nSpoken like an author. Lloyd, I'm not twenty-ish, I'm not thirty-ish. Three months ago I was forty years old. Forty. Four O. That slipped out. I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I suddenly feel as if I've taken all my clothes off.\nI'll admit I may have seen better days, but I'm still not to be had for the price of a cocktail like a salted peanut.\nWhere is Princess... fire and music?\nWhat makes you think either Miller or Sherwood would stand for the nonsense I take from you? You'd better stick to Beaumont and Fletcher! They've been dead for three hundred years!\nALL playwrights should be dead for three hundred years!\nThere comes a time that a piano realizes that it has not written a concerto.\nAnd you, I take it, are the Paderewski who plays his concerto on me, the piano?\nI start shooting a week from Monday. Zanuck is impatient. He wants me, he needs me.\nZanuck, Zanuck, Zanuck. What are you two, lovers?\nI understand that your understudy, Miss Harrington, has given her notice.\nToo bad.\nI'm broken up about it.\nYou be the host. It's your party. Happy birthday, welcome home, and we who are about to die salute you.\nMany of your guests have been wondering when they may be permitted to view the body. Where has it been laid out?\nIt hasn't been laid out, we haven't finished with the embalming. As a matter of fact, you're looking at it - the remains of Margo Channing, sitting up. It is my last wish to be buried sitting up.\nPeace and quiet is for libraries!\nShe thinks only of me, doesn't she?\nWell, let's say she thinks only about you, anyway.\nHow do you mean that?\nI'll tell you how: like... like she's studying you, like you was a play or a book or a set of blueprints - how you walk, talk, eat, think, sleep...\nI'm sure that's very flattering, Birdie. I'm sure there's nothing wrong with it.\nLooks like I'm going to have a very fancy party...\nI thought you were going to be late.\nWhen I'm guest of honor?\nI had no idea you were even here.\nI ran into Eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing.\nThat never stopped you before.\nWell, we started talking, she wanted to know all about Hollywood, she seemed so interested...\nShe's a girl of so many interests.\nIt's a pretty rare quality these days.\nShe's a girl of so many rare qualities.\nSo she seems.\nSo you've pointed out, so often. So many qualities, so often. Her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth, affection - and so young. So young and so fair...\nI haven't got a union. I'm slave labor.\nWell?\nBut the wardrobe women have got one, and next to a tenor, a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business.\nI'm sorry, Margo.\nWhat for? It isn't as though you personally drained the gas tank yourself.\nPlease don't play governess, Karen. I haven't your unyielding good taste. I wish *I* could have gone to Radcliffe, too, but Father wouldn't hear of it... He needed help behind the notions counter\nI'm being rude now, aren't I? Or should I say \"ain't I\"?\nYou're maudlin and full of self-pity. You're magnificent.\nI distinctly remember, Addison, crossing you off of my guest list. What are you doing here?\nDear Margo, you were an unforgettable Peter Pan. You must play it again, soon. You remember Miss Casswell.\nI do not. How do you do?\nWe've never met. Maybe that's why?\nMiss Casswell is an actress, a graduate of the Copacabana school of the dramatic arts.\nAh, Eve.\nGood evening, Mr. DeWitt.\nI'd no idea you two knew each other.\nThis must be at long last our formal introduction. Until now, we've only met in passing.\nThat's how you met me... in passing.\nEve, this is an old friend of Mr. DeWitt's mother. Miss Casswell, Miss Harrington.\nMiss Casswell.\nHow do you do?\nAddison, I've been waiting for you to meet Eve for the longest time.\nIt could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it.\nYou've heard of her great interest in the theater.\nWe have that in common.\nThen you two must have a long talk.\nI'm afraid Mr. DeWitt would find me boring.\nYou won't bore him long, you won't get a chance to talk.\nClaudia, come here.\nYou see that man, that's Max Fabian, the producer. Now, go do yourself some good.\nWhy do they always look like unhappy rabbits?\nBecause that's what they are.\nNow, go and make him happy.\nNow, don't worry about your little charge, she'll be in safe hands.\nAh-men.\nI'm a junkyard.\nYou've been talking to that venomous fishwife Addison DeWitt!\nIn this case, apparently as trustworthy as the World Almanac!\nYou knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy, playing that childish little game of cat and mouse.\nNot mouse, never mouse. If anything *rat*!\nBill's welcome home birthday party might go down in history. Even before the party started, I could smell disaster in the air. I knew it, I sensed it, even as I finished dressing for the blasted party.\nThe extra help get here?\nThere's some loose characters dressed as maids and butlers. Who'd you call, the William Morris Agency?\nYou're not being funny: I could *get* actors for less.\nI can't believe you're making this up. It sounds like something out of an old Clyde Fitch play!\nClyde Fitch, though you may not think so, was well before my time.\nI've always denied the legend that you were in \"Our American Cousin\" the night Lincoln was shot.\nI *don't* think that's funny!\nHeartburn? It's that Miss Casswell. I don't see why she hasn't given Addison heartburn.\nNo heart to burn!\nEverybody has a heart - except some people. \n\nGiven quotes from the character above, which of the following tropes would you say this character represents?\n\nA: Absent Minded Professor\nB: Adventurer Archaeologist\nC: Arrogant Kungfu Guy\nD: Big Man On Campus\nE: Bounty Hunter\nF: Brainless Beauty\nG: Broken Bird\nH: Bromantic Foil\nI: Bruiser With A Soft Center\nJ: Bully\nK: Byronic Hero\nL: Casanova\nM: Chanteuse\nN: Charmer\nO: Child Prodigy\nP: Classy Cat Burglar\nQ: Consummate Professional\nR: Corrupt Corporate Executive\nS: Coward\nT: Crazy Jealous Guy\nU: Crazy Survivalist\nV: Cultured Badass\nW: Dean Bitterman\nX: Dirty Cop\nY: Ditz\nZ: Doormat\nAA: Drill Sargeant Nasty\nAB: Dumb Blonde\nAC: Dumb Muscle\nAD: Eccentric Mentor\nAE: Egomaniac Hunter\nAF: Evil Prince\nAG: Fastest Gun In The West\nAH: Father To His Men\nAI: Final Girl\nAJ: Gadgeteer Genius\nAK: Gentleman Thief\nAL: Granola Person\nAM: Grumpy Old Man\nAN: Hardboiled Detective\nAO: Heartbroken Badass\nAP: Henpecked Husband\nAQ: Hitman With A Heart\nAR: Jerk Jock\nAS: Junkie Prophet\nAT: Klutz\nAU: Loser Protagonist\nAV: Loveable Rogue\nAW: Master Swordsman\nAX: Morally Bankrupt Banker\nAY: Officer And A Gentleman\nAZ: Ophelia\nBA: Playful Hacker\nBB: Prima Donna\nBC: Psycho For Hire\nBD: Pupil Turned To Evil\nBE: Retired Outlaw\nBF: Revenge\nBG: Romantic Runnerup\nBH: Self Made Man\nBI: Slacker\nBJ: Stoner\nBK: Storyteller\nBL: Stupid Crooks\nBM: Surfer Dude\nBN: The Chief\nBO: The Editor\nBP: Tranquil Fury\nBQ: Trickster\nBR: Valley Girl\nBS: Warrior Poet\nBT: Young Gun\n",

Believe me, I don't like her half as much as I hate you, you reptile.\nSticks and stones may break my bones...\nI'd like to break every bone in your body.\nYou and who else, you big lummox?\nWhat do they think I am?

I've even been your guardian angel. Saved your life at the Gypsy camp.\nOh, yes. I'm... much obliged.\nIs any of the opposition around?\nNot in any condition to be worried about.\nWe were keeping you alive until you could get us the Lektor.\nSo, you had me deliver it on a silver plate? That's brilliant. Go on, I'm fascinated.\nNow that we've got it, you and the girl are expendable... from here onto Trieste.\nThe girl? Isn't she working for SPECTRE too?\nNo. She thinks she's doing it all for Mother Russia. She takes her orders from Colonel Klebb. And so do I.\nRosa Klebb? But Colonel Rosa Klebb is a Russian, head of operations for SMERSH.\nCorrection: was. Klebb works for SPECTRE now. The girl doesn't know that.\nBut why kill her?\nOrders. That's only half of it, old man.\nHere's a roll of film. She'll have this in her handbag. And on you they'll find this letter. It's from her, threatening to give the film to the press unless you marry her for helping you steal the Lektor.\nWhat film?\nTaken in the bridal suite at your hotel.

You do not care about the princess.\nYou don't know me very well, do you? Tell you one thing: I hate to think of an innocent member of Chinese nobility suffering, I'll tell you that.\nYou people believe in Karma over there, right? Well I've been thinking... there must be a reason why we keep running into each other. Now I've ridden with some terrible men, just people I couldn't trust, but when I look at you, there's something different about you. And I can see it, I can see it in your eyes. It's what the Indians call... chipichawa.\nWhat's that?\nChipichawa is nobility. And you have it, in spades. You got yourself a partner, and this has nothing to do with gold, okay?\nShake on it.\nWhy are you spitting in your hand?\nWell, it's, uh, customary to seal the deal. Come on, let's go\n. No, you -\nthis is going to be a long journey.\nNow I'm gonna have to get rid of my outlaw name, it just won't work anymore. My real name's Wyatt Earp.\nCome on.

Ninety percent of the time I don't even know what I'm doing out here in the West.\nNo, you're a good outlaw.\nStop, please. I'm a screw-up.\nYou blew it. Whoo, you blew it, man. You did not want to cut his hair off, trust me.\nWhat happened my horse? Is he dead?\nNo, but we are, Chon.\nThese guns are really weird.\nMaybe we should let bygones be bygones. You got off some good shots, I got off some good ones. Let's call it a tie.\nReach for the sky, Baldy!\nReach for the sky, O'Bannon, ha ha!\nThat's my line. He stole my gang, he's stealing my lines.

Work your magic.\nA 2000-year-old civilization and that's the best you can come up with? Shame on you. Shame on you!\nThis is serious. You don't come back from this.\nThat's the general idea.\nWhy don't you turn and face me like a man?\nWhy don't you do it your way and I'll do it my way?\nOkay, I like your energy but I'm not with you...\nWhen the shirt gets wet, it doesn't break.\n...I don't know what that means.\nWhere did you get this guy?\nTexas.\nTexas?\nAre you insane? \n\nGiven quotes from the character above, which of the following tropes would you say this character represents?\n\nA: Absent Minded Professor\nB: Adventurer Archaeologist\nC: Arrogant Kungfu Guy\nD: Big Man On Campus\nE: Bounty Hunter\nF: Brainless Beauty\nG: Broken Bird\nH: Bromantic Foil\nI: Bruiser With A Soft Center\nJ: Bully\nK: Byronic Hero\nL: Casanova\nM: Chanteuse\nN: Charmer\nO: Child Prodigy\nP: Classy Cat Burglar\nQ: Consummate Professional\nR: Corrupt Corporate Executive\nS: Coward\nT: Crazy Jealous Guy\nU: Crazy Survivalist\nV: Cultured Badass\nW: Dean Bitterman\nX: Dirty Cop\nY: Ditz\nZ: Doormat\nAA: Drill Sargeant Nasty\nAB: Dumb Blonde\nAC: Dumb Muscle\nAD: Eccentric Mentor\nAE: Egomaniac Hunter\nAF: Evil Prince\nAG: Fastest Gun In The West\nAH: Father To His Men\nAI: Final Girl\nAJ: Gadgeteer Genius\nAK: Gentleman Thief\nAL: Granola Person\nAM: Grumpy Old Man\nAN: Hardboiled Detective\nAO: Heartbroken Badass\nAP: Henpecked Husband\nAQ: Hitman With A Heart\nAR: Jerk Jock\nAS: Junkie Prophet\nAT: Klutz\nAU: Loser Protagonist\nAV: Loveable Rogue\nAW: Master Swordsman\nAX: Morally Bankrupt Banker\nAY: Officer And A Gentleman\nAZ: Ophelia\nBA: Playful Hacker\nBB: Prima Donna\nBC: Psycho For Hire\nBD: Pupil Turned To Evil\nBE: Retired Outlaw\nBF: Revenge\nBG: Romantic Runnerup\nBH: Self Made Man\nBI: Slacker\nBJ: Stoner\nBK: Storyteller\nBL: Stupid Crooks\nBM: Surfer Dude\nBN: The Chief\nBO: The Editor\nBP: Tranquil Fury\nBQ: Trickster\nBR: Valley Girl\nBS: Warrior Poet\nBT: Young Gun\n",

First three, then two.\nSo, YOU'RE the one who makes appointments.\nAnd you're the one who doesn't keep 'em.\nBut... but they were his men.\nYeah.\nAnd they tried to kill him.\nThey must've found somebody who pays better.\nAnd YOU! You saved his life.\nI didn't let them kill him, and that's not the same thing.\nWhen you hear a strange sound, drop to the ground.\nTime sure flies. It's already past twelve.\nNow I gotta go. Gonna be a beautiful town, Sweetwater.\nI hope you'll come back someday.\nSomeday.\nSurprised to see me here?\nI knew you'd come.\nHey, what in the hell are you standing around for?\nWell, gee, what are we supposed to do?\nWhat are you supposed to do? Build a station! Idiots!\nI figure it ain't gonna look like much, but it'll be the first thing she sees, when she gets back.\nIf she gets back.\nI could swear we're going to have that strange sound.\nRight now.\nHe not only plays. He can shoot too.\nDo you only know how to shoot? Or do you know how to cut too?\nWhat the hell is this?\nCan't you see?\nIt's a station. And all around it a town. Brett McBain's town.\nWas HE crazy, heh!\nYeah in a very special way. An Irishman.\nHe knew sooner or later that railroad coming through Flagstone would continue on west, so he looked over all this county out here until he found this hunk of desert. Nobody wanted it, but he bought it.\nThen he tightened his belt, and for years he waited.\nWaited for what?\nFor the railroad to reach this point.\nAh, but how in the hell could he be sure the railroad would pass through his property?\nThem steam engines can't roll without water, and the only water for fifty miles west of Flagstone is right here, under this land.\nAh-ha! He was no fool, our dead friend, huh?\nHe was going to sell this piece of desert for his weight in gold, wasn't he?\nYou don't sell the dream of a lifetime. Brett McBain wanted his station. He got the rights to build it.\nHow do you know all this?\nI saw a document. It was all in order - seals, signatures, everything. One thing though, in very small print, there is a short clause which says that McBain or his heirs lose all rights if, by the time the railroad reaches this point, the station ain't built yet.\nYou know, Wobbles... I'm kind of mad at you.\nPick any method you like, just make the deal.\nWhich deal, Frank? We have more than one, you and me. \n\nGiven quotes from the character above, which of the following tropes would you say this character represents?\n\nA: Absent Minded Professor\nB: Adventurer Archaeologist\nC: Arrogant Kungfu Guy\nD: Big Man On Campus\nE: Bounty Hunter\nF: Brainless Beauty\nG: Broken Bird\nH: Bromantic Foil\nI: Bruiser With A Soft Center\nJ: Bully\nK: Byronic Hero\nL: Casanova\nM: Chanteuse\nN: Charmer\nO: Child Prodigy\nP: Classy Cat Burglar\nQ: Consummate Professional\nR: Corrupt Corporate Executive\nS: Coward\nT: Crazy Jealous Guy\nU: Crazy Survivalist\nV: Cultured Badass\nW: Dean Bitterman\nX: Dirty Cop\nY: Ditz\nZ: Doormat\nAA: Drill Sargeant Nasty\nAB: Dumb Blonde\nAC: Dumb Muscle\nAD: Eccentric Mentor\nAE: Egomaniac Hunter\nAF: Evil Prince\nAG: Fastest Gun In The West\nAH: Father To His Men\nAI: Final Girl\nAJ: Gadgeteer Genius\nAK: Gentleman Thief\nAL: Granola Person\nAM: Grumpy Old Man\nAN: Hardboiled Detective\nAO: Heartbroken Badass\nAP: Henpecked Husband\nAQ: Hitman With A Heart\nAR: Jerk Jock\nAS: Junkie Prophet\nAT: Klutz\nAU: Loser Protagonist\nAV: Loveable Rogue\nAW: Master Swordsman\nAX: Morally Bankrupt Banker\nAY: Officer And A Gentleman\nAZ: Ophelia\nBA: Playful Hacker\nBB: Prima Donna\nBC: Psycho For Hire\nBD: Pupil Turned To Evil\nBE: Retired Outlaw\nBF: Revenge\nBG: Romantic Runnerup\nBH: Self Made Man\nBI: Slacker\nBJ: Stoner\nBK: Storyteller\nBL: Stupid Crooks\nBM: Surfer Dude\nBN: The Chief\nBO: The Editor\nBP: Tranquil Fury\nBQ: Trickster\nBR: Valley Girl\nBS: Warrior Poet\nBT: Young Gun\n",

You know what that means? Do ya? That means that our forefathers were kicked out of every decent country in the world. We are the wretched refuse. We're the underdog. We're mutts! Here's proof: his nose is cold! But there's no animal that's more faithful, that's more loyal, more loveable than the mutt. Who saw \"Old Yeller?\" Who cried when Old Yeller got shot at the end?\nNobody cried when Old Yeller got shot? I'm sure.\nI cried my eyes out. So we're all dogfaces, we're all very, very different, but there is one thing that we all have in common: we were all stupid enough to enlist in the Army. We're mutants. There's something wrong with us, something very, very wrong with us. Something seriously wrong with us - we're soldiers. But we're American soldiers! We've been kicking ass for 200 years! We're ten and one! Now we don't have to worry about whether or not we practiced. We don't have to worry about whether Captain Stillman wants to have us hung. All we have to do is to be the great American fighting soldier that is inside each one of us. Now do what I do, and say what I say. And make me proud.\nHave you ever been convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor? That's robbery, rape, car theft, that sort of thing.\nConvicted? No.\nNever convicted.\nC'mon, it's Czechoslovakia. We zip in, we pick 'em up, we zip right out again. We're not going to Moscow. It's Czechoslovakia. It's like going into Wisconsin.\nWell I got the shit kicked out of me in Wisconsin once.

But now I know why I have always lost women to guys like you. I mean, it's not just the uniform. It's the stories that you tell. So much fun and imagination.\nLee Harvey, you are a madman. When you stole that cow, and your friend tried to make it with the cow. I want to party with you, cowboy. If the two of us together, forget it. I'm gonna go out on a limb here. I'm gonna volunteer my leadership to this platoon. An army without leaders is like a foot without a big toe. And Sergeant Hulka isn't always gonna be here to be that big toe for us. I think that we owe a big round of applause to our newest, bestest buddy, and big toe... Sergeant Hulka.\nWell, okay, hot shot. We're gonna see what kind of soldier you are. Reveille is O five hundred. We're going to fall out with locker boxes and we're going to have a locker box inspection. And then we're going to do ten miles. Rain or shine! So, you better hit them bunks my little babies. Or, Sgt Hulka with the big toe is going to see how far he can stick it up your ass!\nAnd then depression set in.\nYou could join a monastery.\nDid you ever see a monk get wildly fucked by some teenage girls?\nNever.\nSo much for the monastery.\nNow, are either of you homosexuals?\nYou mean, like, flaming, or...\nWell, it's a standard question we have to ask.\nNo, we're not homosexual, but we are *willing to learn*.\nYeah, would they send us someplace special?\nI guess that's \"no\" on both. Now if you could just give Uncle Sam your autograph...\nWhere is your drill sergeant, men?\nBlown up, sir!\nBlown up, sir!\nMy philosophy: a hundred-dollar shine on a three-dollar pair of shoes.\nJohn, do you think I'm officer material?\nGod, I'm worried about you.\nCome on! I'm in good shape, I'm walking tall, I'm looking good. First weekend in Europe.\nYeah. We're spending it in an airplane hangar... guarding a truck!\nWe've got each other.\nTito Puente's gonna be dead, and you're gonna say, \"Oh, I've been listening to him for years, and I think he's fabulous.\"\nAre you telling me that you men finished your training on your own?\nThat's the fact, Jack.\nThat's the fact, Jack.\nMen, welcome to the United States Army. I'm Sergeant Hulka. I'm your drill sergeant. Before we proceed any further, we gotta get something straight. Your mamas are not here to take care of you now. It's just you, me, and Uncle Sam. And before I leave you, you're gonna find out that me and Uncle Sam are one in the same.\nUncle Hulka?\nWhy'd the chicken cross the road?\nTo get from the left to the right\nHe stepped out of rank, got hit by a tank\nHe ain't no chicken no more\nYou know something soldier, I've noticed that you're always last.\nI'm pacing myself, Sergeant.\nMove it!\nCome on.

We're gonna start out with a five-mile run.\nI know that I'm speaking for the entire platoon when I say this run should be postponed until this platoon is better rested.\nWell, I'll tell you what, soldier. Let's make it ten miles.\nYou don't say \"sir\" to me, I'm a sergeant, I work for a living.\nYes, sergeant!\nI didn't hear you!\n*Yes, sergeant*!\n*That's* what I wanna hear.\nDo you think this guy's over-doing it a bit?\nI'm talking about something important, like discipline and duty and honor and courage. And you ain't got none of it!\nThose words mean so much to a man who scrubs garbage cans. Look, if you don't want me in your Army, kick me out, but get off my back.\nMaybe you'd like to take a swing at me.\nI 'd like to take a BIG swing at you, sarge.\nWell, go ahead and give it your best shot.\nI don't think I want to go to the stockade.\nI'll take my hat off. There we are, Winger. Ain't no more drill sergeant. It's just you and me, kid, man to man. So go ahead, give it your best shot. Swing at me. Gutless. Punk!\nI'm willing to forget this little incident. And I want you to think real hard about it. And maybe someday you'll understand what the hell I'm talking about.\nWhere do you think you're going? Are you going AWOL? Are you going AWOL?\nNo, I'm deserting.\nYou idiot! You desert now, it's a federal offense!\nI'll take my chances with the feds!\nYou're not going anywhere!\nYou listen to me! You're gonna finish basic training! You're gonna keep your mouth shut, and you're gonna do everything he tells you! You know why?\nWhy?\nBecause you talked me into this, you idiot! It was your idea!\nI didn't talk you into this. You NEEDED this.\nI'm gonna kill you, damn you! Where's the great pay? Where's the travel? Where's the Winnebago, Goddamnit!\nOh, my balls! OH, MY BALLS!\nDon't order the Schnitzel, they're using Schnauzer.\nI've had an interesting morning. In the last two hours I've lost my job, my apartment, my car, and my girlfriend.\nYou still have your health.\nWe're so damned lost. Where the hell is Innsbruck, Austria?\nNow, since nobody else has got the guts...\n...to admit it, the rest of this platoon... will do the next two weekends on KP.\nHow's that sound to you, mister?\nI think it sucks.\nYou know who would love this? Russell!\n, :\nRussell! Russell! Help us!\n, :\nRussell! Russell! Help us!\nThaaaank yoooou!\nIt doesn't seem fair.\nFAIR? Who cares about fair? The world isn't fair. Truth is fair. Is it fair that you were born like this? NO! They're not expecting somebody like you in there, Ox. They're expected one of these slugs. You're different. You're weird. You're a mutant. You're a killer. You're a trained killer. You're a LEAN... MEAN...\n, :\nFIGHTING... MACHINE!\"\n, :\nFIGHTING... MACHINE!\"\nI'LL DO IT!\nBoxer or Jockey?\nYou got something in a low-rise bikini? Mesh, if possible.\nI'm Captain Hollister, Special Operations Group. Who are you?\nI'm Major Dodge.\nCaptain DeSoto.\nPleasure to meet you, Hollister.

It's double double top-secret.\nIntelligence?\nSome.\nIntelligence?\nJohn Winger: Some\nWell, that was interesting.\n. That's not what I heard.\nWho said that?\nPick that up! Who said that!\nWas it you?\nI said it.\nNow, I don't care what you heard. My sources told me that Sgt. Crocker was in guilt of the accident and unable to control his men!\nHave it your way... sir.\nYou bet I will, soldier. Now, I don't want to hear one more insubordinate word from anyone in this platoon. The subject is closed. You better stop worrying about what happened to Sgt. Hulka and start worrying about how you're all going to pass graduation, tomorrow. You have three days to get it together and if you want my honest opinion\nYou're not going to make it.\nThere are two things I promised myself I'd never do: Kill and die.\nWhat if the Russians were raping your sister?\nCome on, you know my sister. You practically raped her one night. The Russians would just have to buy her dinner.\nHello? Hello?\nHello?\nHello.\nWho is it?\nIt's Idi Amin.\nIt's Winger!\nDo the words \"act of war\" mean anything to you?\nI have... a plan.\nGreat! Custer had a plan, too.\nHow much can you straighten out in one week?\nIt hasn't been a week, John. It's been six months! Nothing's changed! You sleep until noon and then you watch \"Rocky and Bullwinkle\" and then you drive your... , what, a couple of hours? You come home and you order out food and then you play those stupid Tito Puente albums until two in the morning!\nTito Puente is going to be dead and you're going to say, \"Oh, I've been listening to him for years and I think he's fabulous.\"\nThat's right. And then you watch movies until dawn and then - then you come to bed with me.\nYou don't think that takes energy? You're a sexual dynamo! Most guys couldn't even handle you. I've been readin' books on the outside just so I can keep up with you!\nIt's not funny. You're going nowhere, John. It's just not that cute anymore.\nIt's a little cute. Come on, I'm part of a lost and restless generation. What do you want me to do? Run for the Senate?\nJohn, no. It's not going to work! Look, I like you; but, I need something more. I need somebody whose going to develop with me and somebody whose going to grow with me. Goodbye.\nGrow?\nBye.\nWho can grow more than me? Talk about massive potential for growth! I am the little acorn that becomes the oak!\nThis doesn't look bad.\nWhat? The Army? You're kidding.\nNo. I've always thought about joining the Army.\nBull shit, you're not the type.\nWhat do you mean I'm not the type? I've seen the kind of guys that enlist in the Army. I saw them when I was working in unemployment. They're just like us, except they're not as - sophisticated.\nYeah, they're not as old either.\nYou're all in this together!\nOne of these men may save your life one of these days. You understand that?\nThen again, maybe one of us won't.\nThis might be fun.\nYou know what the rest of your problem is?\nTell me.\nYou've never had anybody give you the Aunt Jemima treatment.\nWho's your friend?

    "56": "So, Mi-chelle! What are you up to?\nOh, okay. Um, I invented Post-Its.\nNo offense, Michele, but how in the world did *you* think of Post-Its?\nUh...\nAnd I thought of them completely by myself. I mean, all Michele did was say: \"What about making them yellow?\"\nActually I invented a special kind of glue.\nOh really? Well then I'm sure you wouldn't mind giving us a detailed account of exactly how you concocted this miracle glue, would you?\nNo. Um, well, ordinarily when you make glue first you need to thermoset your resin and then after it cools you have to mix in an epoxide, which is really just a fancy-schmancy name for any simple oxygenated adhesive, right? And then I thought maybe, just maybe, you could raise the viscosity by adding a complex glucose derivative during the emulsification process and it turns out I was right.\nSwear to God, sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.\nDo you want to try to have sex sometime just to see if we are?\nWhat? Yeah, right, Michelle. Just the idea of having sex with another woman creeps me out. But if we're not married by the time we're 30, ask me again.\nOkay.\nOh my God, you did it!\nYeah, I did.\nWhat did you have to do?\nI had to give everyone in the service department hand jobs.\nWell, while you were doing that, I made us a tape of all the nostalgic songs from high school to get us in the mood.\nMichele?\nWhat?\nDo you really think I would do that? For a car? Just get in.\nO.K.\nFor me, it's like I've just given birth to my own baby girl, except she's like a big giant girl who smokes and says \"shit\" a lot. You know?\nI don't believe it!\nWhat?\nTHAT!\nThey're back!\nNice outfits. Post-it's must be really lucrative!\nRomy, are you sure you wanna do this?\nOh yeah, Michele. I am SO sure!\nWhat the hell is your problem, Christie? Why the hell are you always such a nasty bitch? I mean, okay, so Michele and I did make up some stupid lie! We only did it because we wanted you to treat us like human beings. But you know what I realized? I don't care if you like us, 'cause we don't like you. You're a bad person with an ugly heart, and we don't give a flying fuck what you think!\nCome on Michele.\nOkay, and... YEAH!\nUnbelievable! They're as deluded about their lives as they are about those HIDEOUS clothes\nActually Christie. They have nice lines. A fun, frisky use of color. All and all, I'd have to say they're really... NOT BAD!\nWell, WE still think they're ridiculous. Don't we girls?\nWhy don't you just let them think for themselves for once?\nYou're just jealous. Because unlike a certain ball-busting dried up career woman, I might mention, we're all HAPPILY MARRIED!\nThat's right, Christie. Keep telling yourself that.\nRemember the prom? You got so thin by then.\nOh, I know. I was so lucky getting mono. That was like the best diet ever.\nDid you lose weight?\nActually, I have been trying this new fat free diet I invented. All I've had to eat for the past six days are gummy bears, jelly beans, and candy corns.\nGod, I wish I had your discipline.\nYou look so good with blond hair and black roots its like not even funny.\nWanna get a room?\nBut you're married!\nTo Christie!\nYeah, but you have children, and you're a successful real estate developer.\nI do dry wall for her old man's construction company, and you know this new kid, don't even know if he's mine! So, how about that room?\nOkay. Why don't you get that room? Why don't you wash your face and take off all your clothes? And, I'll be there in five minutes.\nAll right! Your fantasy is going to come true tonight. See you later!\nBye.\nNow he's going to see what it feels like to wait.\nSuch a good one.\nOh my God! Remember what a big controversy it was for us to have our picture taken together?\nYeah, because Danny Weller like, lodged that complaint. Because alphabetically he was supposed to be between us.\nSo we said: \"OK Danny. If you want to be between us, come to Michele's house on Friday night and we'll be waiting.\"\nAnd then he showed up, and we were like: \"Danny, it was a joke!\"\nAnd then we turned the sprinklers on him!\nOh my God!\nDidn't he die?\nI think so.\nHey Romy, remember Mrs. Divitz's class, there was like always a word problem. Like, there's a guy in a rowboat going X miles, and the current is going like, you know, some other miles, and how long does it take him to get to town? It's like, 'Who cares? Who wants to go to town with a guy who drives a rowboat?\nAll I ever wanted was for people to think that we were better than we were in high school. And now we're just a stupid joke, just like we always were.\nRomy, can I tell you the truth? I never knew that we weren't that great in high school. I mean, we always had so much fun together... I thought high school was a blast! And until you told me that our lives weren't good enough, I thought everything *since* high school was a blast. I think we should go back out there as ourselves, and just have fun like we always do. The hell with everyone else!\nI don't think I can.\nWell, do you think you can stop being such a baby? God! I feel like I've been, like, chasing you all over this reunion. We have come all this way, now we are going to enjoy ourselves whether you like it or not!\nGod, Michele... I've never seen this side of your personality before. You're so bossy and domineering. I like it!\nMe too!\nI'm the Mary, and you're the Rhoda.\nYOU'RE the Rhoda, you're the Jewish one.\nThis dress exacerbates the genetic betrayal that is my legacy.\nOK, I don't even know what you're talking about cause of those words, but come here.\nYou know, even though I had to wear that stupid back brace and you were kind of fat, we were still totally cutting edge.\nSandy Frink has a helicopter?\nYeah, apparently he's worth millions. He invented some kind of rubber.\nLike for condoms?\nTo me, fashion is just like... everything.\nBy the way... Hi! That blouse looks great on you!\nThank you!\nAnd see? I have this really believable way of telling people they look really good, even though I'm just, you know...\n.\n\nI think she heard me.\n, :\n\nCut loose! Footloose! Kick off your sunday shoes!\n, :\n\nCut loose! Footloose! Kick off your sunday shoes!\nI have no idea what the rest of the lyrics are...\nWow, all that time you guys were making my life hell, the A group was doing the same thing to you! I had no idea!\nYou know? I bet in high school, everybody made somebody's life hell.\nNope, sorry, never had the opportunity.\nI bet that's not true...\nYou think?\nOh, yeah, you were really unpleasant.\nYou have absolutely no proof that you're cuter.\nOh, proof. You want proof? Ok, fine. Who lost their virginity first?\nOh, big wow, with your cousin Barry. I wouldn't brag about it.\nYou know, even though we've watched Pretty Woman like thirty-six times, I never get tired of making fun of it.\nLet's fold scarves!\nWell, my first choice was to work at a boutique on Rodeo Drive, but this would be okay.\nDo you have some sort of business woman special?\nCome again?\nWell, were business women.\nFrom LA.\nAnd you know how some places have like a lunch special?\nFor business women...\nWe don't have anything like that.\nOk we'll take 2 burgers, fries, and medium cokes cause were in a hurry.\nWe're due in Tucson later... some business thing, you know.\nWhat kind of business you all in?\nBilly, honey. Tell your mommy that Michelle Wienberger is on the phone.\nNo. Not Until you admit that I'm the Mary, and you're the Rhoda.\nI'm the Mary! You're a pasty hag on your death bed!\nThanks a lot Romy.\nWhat?\nThanks for stealing my boyfriend!\nWhat are you talking about?\nBilly just broke up with me. Apparently he's had a crush on you since Mr. Roswell's class and now that he knows that you like him, he doesn't want to pretend with me anymore. My life was perfect and you ruined it! Oh!\nI swear to God Christy, I didn't even think he'd dance with me!\nWow, she is really P.O.'d. This is so cool!\nI know. It's like I had this dream where Billy was like in love with me, and he was in a wheelchair, but still, it's like it's coming true!\nI've been killing myself for eight days and I gained a pound.\nThat's impossible. Did you deduct sixteen pounds for your shoes?\nOw! That hurt! But it looked really good!\nThe reunion is less than two weeks away. I just can't believe that you turned down a job!\nWell, I thought the whole point of going to the reunion was to impress people. I mean, how am I gonna impress ANYBODY by selling ban-lon smocks at Bargain Mart?\nWell we definitely weren't in the A group, but you know, we weren't really in the B group either.\nOh my god! We weren't in the C group were we?\nOh god no, that was, like, all the losers and honor students, like Sandy Frink and Heather Mooney.\nSo, Romy, what group WERE we in?\nWell, we weren't really in a group, we were more like loners. Oh look! There we are!\nYeah, and alone.\nJust a reminder, girls - you have DETENTION after school today.\nYeah, we're really looking forward to it!\nCan you believe he just got married? Like how desperate is she?\nLike that one chip is gonna make a difference... wasn't even a whole chip.\nYou also get a 5% employee discount over and above our everyday low prices.\nI got this tie for a dollar.\nYou paid a whole dollar for that?\nMichele? Now that I'm looking at this, our lives don't seem as impressive as I thought.\nThey don't?\nWell, do you think it's impressive that we're still single, and we've been living together for ten years, and I'm a cashier and you're unemployed?\nNot super-impressive.\nThen, what's the point of going if we're not going to impress people?\nYou paid a whole dollar for that?\nI'd like to go... away!\nYou also get a 5% employee discount, over and above our everyday low prices.\nI got this tie for a dollar.\nYou paid a whole dollar for that?\nSo, Mi-chelle! What are you up to?\nOh, okay. Um, I invented Post-Its.\nNo offense, Michele, but how in the world did *you* think of Post-Its?\nUh...\nAnd I thought of them completely by myself. I mean, all Michele did was say: \"What about making them yellow?\"\nActually I invented a special kind of glue.\nOh really? Well then I'm sure you wouldn't mind giving us a detailed account of exactly how you concocted this miracle glue, would you?\nNo. Um, well, ordinarily when you make glue first you need to thermoset your resin and then after it cools you have to mix in an epoxide, which is really just a fancy-schmancy name for any simple oxygenated adhesive, right? And then I thought maybe, just maybe, you could raise the viscosity by adding a complex glucose derivative during the emulsification process and it turns out I was right.\nSwear to God, sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.\nDo you want to try to have sex sometime just to see if we are?\nWhat? Yeah, right, Michelle. Just the idea of having sex with another woman creeps me out. But if we're not married by the time we're 30, ask me again.\nOkay.\nOh my God, you did it!\nYeah, I did.\nWhat did you have to do?\nI had to give everyone in the service department hand jobs.\nWell, while you were doing that, I made us a tape of all the nostalgic songs from high school to get us in the mood.\nMichele?\nWhat?\nDo you really think I would do that? For a car? Just get in.\nO.K.\nFor me, it's like I've just given birth to my own baby girl, except she's like a big giant girl who smokes and says \"shit\" a lot. You know?\nI don't believe it!\nWhat?\nTHAT!\nThey're back!\nNice outfits. Post-it's must be really lucrative!\nRomy, are you sure you wanna do this?\nOh yeah, Michele. I am SO sure!\nWhat the hell is your problem, Christie? Why the hell are you always such a nasty bitch? I mean, okay, so Michele and I did make up some stupid lie! We only did it because we wanted you to treat us like human beings. But you know what I realized? I don't care if you like us, 'cause we don't like you. You're a bad person with an ugly heart, and we don't give a flying fuck what you think!\nCome on Michele.\nOkay, and... YEAH!\nUnbelievable! They're as deluded about their lives as they are about those HIDEOUS clothes\nActually Christie. They have nice lines. A fun, frisky use of color. All and all, I'd have to say they're really... NOT BAD!\nWell, WE still think they're ridiculous. Don't we girls?\nWhy don't you just let them think for themselves for once?\nYou're just jealous. Because unlike a certain ball-busting dried up career woman, I might mention, we're all HAPPILY MARRIED!\nThat's right, Christie. Keep telling yourself that.\nRemember the prom? You got so thin by then.\nOh, I know. I was so lucky getting mono. That was like the best diet ever.\nDid you lose weight?\nActually, I have been trying this new fat free diet I invented. All I've had to eat for the past six days are gummy bears, jelly beans, and candy corns.\nGod, I wish I had your discipline.\nYou look so good with blond hair and black roots its like not even funny.\nWanna get a room?\nBut you're married!\nTo Christie!\nYeah, but you have children, and you're a successful real estate developer.\nI do dry wall for her old man's construction company, and you know this new kid, don't even know if he's mine! So, how about that room?\nOkay. Why don't you get that room? Why don't you wash your face and take off all your clothes? And, I'll be there in five minutes.\nAll right! Your fantasy is going to come true tonight. See you later!\nBye.\nNow he's going to see what it feels like to wait.\nSuch a good one.\nOh my God! Remember what a big controversy it was for us to have our picture taken together?\nYeah, because Danny Weller like, lodged that complaint. Because alphabetically he was supposed to be between us.\nSo we said: \"OK Danny. If you want to be between us, come to Michele's house on Friday night and we'll be waiting.\"\nAnd then he showed up, and we were like: \"Danny, it was a joke!\"\nAnd then we turned the sprinklers on him!\nOh my God!\nDidn't he die?\nI think so.\nHey Romy, remember Mrs. Divitz's class, there was like always a word problem. Like, there's a guy in a rowboat going X miles, and the current is going like, you know, some other miles, and how long does it take him to get to town? It's like, 'Who cares? Who wants to go to town with a guy who drives a rowboat?\nAll I ever wanted was for people to think that we were better than we were in high school. And now we're just a stupid joke, just like we always were.\nRomy, can I tell you the truth? I never knew that we weren't that great in high school. I mean, we always had so much fun together... I thought high school was a blast! And until you told me that our lives weren't good enough, I thought everything *since* high school was a blast. I think we should go back out there as ourselves, and just have fun like we always do. The hell with everyone else!\nI don't think I can.\nWell, do you think you can stop being such a baby? God! I feel like I've been, like, chasing you all over this reunion. We have come all this way, now we are going to enjoy ourselves whether you like it or not!\nGod, Michele... I've never seen this side of your personality before. You're so bossy and domineering. I like it!\nMe too!\nI'm the Mary, and you're the Rhoda.\nYOU'RE the Rhoda, you're the Jewish one.\nThis dress exacerbates the genetic betrayal that is my legacy.\nOK, I don't even know what you're talking about cause of those words, but come here.\nYou know, even though I had to wear that stupid back brace and you were kind of fat, we were still totally cutting edge.\nSandy Frink has a helicopter?\nYeah, apparently he's worth millions.

So, what do you do?\nI'm a suit salesman.\nWould you excuse me?

I'm not going to have sex with you just to borrow your stupid car!\nI gotta get something!\nOK... close the blinds, and we'll work something out.\nYou have absolutely no proof that you're cuter.\nOh, proof. You want proof? Ok, fine. Who lost their virginity first?\nOh, big wow, with your cousin Barry. I wouldn't brag about it.\nDo you have some sort of business woman special?\nCome again?\nWell, were business women.\nFrom LA.\nAnd you know how some places have like a lunch special?\nFor business women...\nWe don't have anything like that.\nOk we'll take 2 burgers, fries, and medium cokes cause were in a hurry.\nWe're due in Tucson later... some business thing, you know.\nWhat kind of business you all in?\nHeather? Heather Mooney? From Sagebrush High in Tuscon?\nYeah?\nIt's Romy! Romy White!\nYou're shittin' me.\nNo! This is so weird - I didn't know you were living in L.A.\nWell, now that you know, will we be getting together a lot?\nBilly, honey. Tell your mommy that Michelle Wienberger is on the phone.\nNo. Not Until you admit that I'm the Mary, and you're the Rhoda.\nI'm the Mary! You're a pasty hag on your death bed!\nThanks a lot Romy.\nWhat?\nThanks for stealing my boyfriend!\nWhat are you talking about?\nBilly just broke up with me. Apparently he's had a crush on you since Mr. Roswell's class and now that he knows that you like him, he doesn't want to pretend with me anymore. My life was perfect and you ruined it! Oh!\nI swear to God Christy, I didn't even think he'd dance with me!\nWow, she is really P.O.'d. This is so cool!\nI know. It's like I had this dream where Billy was like in love with me, and he was in a wheelchair, but still, it's like it's coming true!\nWell, anyways, are you going?\nI'd rather put this out in my ass!\nI've been killing myself for eight days and I gained a pound.\nThat's impossible. Did you deduct sixteen pounds for your shoes?\nIsn't it weird when you're not friends with your friends anymore? I mean, Michele and I just fell out of touch about two hours ago.\nThe reunion is less than two weeks away. I just can't believe that you turned down a job!\nWell, I thought the whole point of going to the reunion was to impress people.

Now that I'm looking at this, our lives don't seem as impressive as I thought.\nThey don't?\nWell, do you think it's impressive that we're still single, and we've been living together for ten years, and I'm a cashier and you're unemployed?\nNot super-impressive.\nThen, what's the point of going if we're not going to impress people?\nChubbo?\nThe name is Romy.\nYeah, Ramon. That'll happen.\nHi, my name's Romy and I'm an alcoholic.\nHi Romy.\nHey.\nSo, Mi-chelle! What are you up to?\nOh, okay.

Because unlike a certain ball-busting dried up career woman, I might mention, we're all HAPPILY MARRIED!\nThat's right, Christie. Keep telling yourself that.\nRemember the prom? You got so thin by then.\nOh, I know. I was so lucky getting mono. That was like the best diet ever.\nHeather, um, has anyone ever told you that smoking can kill you?\nNo. No one. Thank you.\nDid you lose weight?\nActually, I have been trying this new fat free diet I invented. All I've had to eat for the past six days are gummy bears, jelly beans, and candy corns.\nGod, I wish I had your discipline.\nWanna get a room?\nBut you're married!\nTo Christie!\nYeah, but you have children, and you're a successful real estate developer.\nI do dry wall for her old man's construction company, and you know this new kid, don't even know if he's mine! So, how about that room?\nOkay. Why don't you get that room? Why don't you wash your face and take off all your clothes? And, I'll be there in five minutes.\nAll right! Your fantasy is going to come true tonight. See you later!\nBye.\nNow he's going to see what it feels like to wait.\nSuch a good one.\nOh my God! Remember what a big controversy it was for us to have our picture taken together?\nYeah, because Danny Weller like, lodged that complaint. Because alphabetically he was supposed to be between us.\nSo we said: \"OK Danny. If you want to be between us, come to Michele's house on Friday night and we'll be waiting.\"\nAnd then he showed up, and we were like: \"Danny, it was a joke!\"\nAnd then we turned the sprinklers on him!\nOh my God!\nDidn't he die?\nI think so.\nAw, look, poor thing - they won't let her shop. Yeah - like those salesgirls in Beverly Hills aren't bigger whores than she is.\nHey, um, great suit. Is that an Armani?\nYes. Yes, it is.\nI thought so. So, what do you do?\nI'm a suit salesman.\nWould you excuse me? I cut my foot before and my shoe is filling up with blood.\nDo you live with Michele Weinberger?\nYeah.\nI just figured she'd be married to Sandy by now.\nSandy Frink?\nYes, Sandy Frink! He could barely contain his erection every time she walked by! Why do you think he always carried around that huge notebook?\nThe Frink-a-zoid and Michele... I'm sure! Besides, didn't *you* have a thing for Sandy in high school?\nI did not have a THING! I did not have a thing, I did NOT have a THING! I was VERY much in love with him! VERY much in love and there's a difference!\nThere's a difference!\nThere's a difference! I have to go now!\nAll I ever wanted was for people to think that we were better than we were in high school. And now we're just a stupid joke, just like we always were.\nRomy, can I tell you the truth? I never knew that we weren't that great in high school. I mean, we always had so much fun together... I thought high school was a blast! And until you told me that our lives weren't good enough, I thought everything *since* high school was a blast. I think we should go back out there as ourselves, and just have fun like we always do. The hell with everyone else!\nI don't think I can.\nWell, do you think you can stop being such a baby? God! I feel like I've been, like, chasing you all over this reunion. We have come all this way, now we are going to enjoy ourselves whether you like it or not!\nGod, Michele... I've never seen this side of your personality before. You're so bossy and domineering. I like it!\nMe too!\nI'm the Mary, and you're the Rhoda.\nYOU'RE the Rhoda, you're the Jewish one.\nSandy Frink has a helicopter?\nYeah, apparently he's worth millions. He invented some kind of rubber.\nLike for condoms?\n, :\n\nCut loose! Footloose! Kick off your sunday shoes!\n, :\n\nCut loose! Footloose! Kick off your sunday shoes!\nI have no idea what the rest of the lyrics are...\nYou have to say something nice about my penis!\nOh, Ramon! Your penis is so powerful! I'm coming! Okay, thanks, get off me now.\nHave a \"Romy and Michele\" day!\nMichelle and I have this high school reunion to go to, and we need to show up in a really cool car.\nYeah?\nTodd told me he gave you a really great deal on a convertible and that you were fixing it up.\nYeah?\nSo... can I borrow your car?\nWell, if I loan you my car, what do I get?\nUh... what do you want?\nOh, Romy... you know what I want.\nForget it! I'm not going to have sex with you just to borrow your stupid car!\nI gotta get something!\nOK... close the blinds, and we'll work something out.\nYou have absolutely no proof that you're cuter.\nOh, proof. You want proof? Ok, fine. Who lost their virginity first?\nOh, big wow, with your cousin Barry. I wouldn't brag about it.\nDo you have some sort of business woman special?\nCome again?\nWell, were business women.\nFrom LA.\nAnd you know how some places have like a lunch special?\nFor business women...\nWe don't have anything like that.\nOk we'll take 2 burgers, fries, and medium cokes cause were in a hurry.\nWe're due in Tucson later... some business thing, you know.\nWhat kind of business you all in?\nHeather? Heather Mooney? From Sagebrush High in Tuscon?\nYeah?\nIt's Romy! Romy White!\nYou're shittin' me.\nNo! This is so weird - I didn't know you were living in L.A.\nWell, now that you know, will we be getting together a lot?\nBilly, honey. Tell your mommy that Michelle Wienberger is on the phone.\nNo. Not Until you admit that I'm the Mary, and you're the Rhoda.\nI'm the Mary! You're a pasty hag on your death bed!\nThanks a lot Romy.\nWhat?\nThanks for stealing my boyfriend!\nWhat are you talking about?\nBilly just broke up with me. Apparently he's had a crush on you since Mr. Roswell's class and now that he knows that you like him, he doesn't want to pretend with me anymore. My life was perfect and you ruined it! Oh!\nI swear to God Christy, I didn't even think he'd dance with me!\nWow, she is really P.O.'d. This is so cool!\nI know. It's like I had this dream where Billy was like in love with me, and he was in a wheelchair, but still, it's like it's coming true!\nWell, anyways, are you going?\nI'd rather put this out in my ass!\nI've been killing myself for eight days and I gained a pound.\nThat's impossible. Did you deduct sixteen pounds for your shoes?\nIsn't it weird when you're not friends with your friends anymore? I mean, Michele and I just fell out of touch about two hours ago.\nThe reunion is less than two weeks away. I just can't believe that you turned down a job!\nWell, I thought the whole point of going to the reunion was to impress people. I mean, how am I gonna impress ANYBODY by selling ban-lon smocks at Bargain Mart?\nWell we definitely weren't in the A group, but you know, we weren't really in the B group either.\nOh my god! We weren't in the C group were we?\nOh god no, that was, like, all the losers and honor students, like Sandy Frink and Heather Mooney.\nSo, Romy, what group WERE we in?\nWell, we weren't really in a group, we were more like loners. Oh look! There we are!\nYeah, and alone.\nJust a reminder, girls - you have DETENTION after school today.\nYeah, we're really looking forward to it!\nCan you believe he just got married? Like how desperate is she?\nHey, if anyone needs to make a call, I've got a phone!\nMichele? Now that I'm looking at this, our lives don't seem as impressive as I thought.\nThey don't?\nWell, do you think it's impressive that we're still single, and we've been living together for ten years, and I'm a cashier and you're unemployed?\nNot super-impressive.\nThen, what's the point of going if we're not going to impress people?\nChubbo?\nThe name is Romy.\nYeah, Ramon. That'll happen.\nHi, my name's Romy and I'm an alcoholic.\nHi Romy.\nHey.\nSo, Mi-chelle! What are you up to?\nOh, okay. Um, I invented Post-Its.\nNo offense, Michele, but how in the world did *you* think of Post-Its?\nUh...\nAnd I thought of them completely by myself. I mean, all Michele did was say: \"What about making them yellow?\"\nActually I invented a special kind of glue.\nOh really? Well then I'm sure you wouldn't mind giving us a detailed account of exactly how you concocted this miracle glue, would you?\nNo. Um, well, ordinarily when you make glue first you need to thermoset your resin and then after it cools you have to mix in an epoxide, which is really just a fancy-schmancy name for any simple oxygenated adhesive, right? And then I thought maybe, just maybe, you could raise the viscosity by adding a complex glucose derivative during the emulsification process and it turns out I was right.\nSwear to God, sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.\nDo you want to try to have sex sometime just to see if we are?\nWhat? Yeah, right, Michelle. Just the idea of having sex with another woman creeps me out. But if we're not married by the time we're 30, ask me again.\nOkay.\nOh my God, you did it!\nYeah, I did.\nWhat did you have to do?\nI had to give everyone in the service department hand jobs.\nWell, while you were doing that, I made us a tape of all the nostalgic songs from high school to get us in the mood.\nMichele?\nWhat?\nDo you really think I would do that? For a car? Just get in.\nO.K.\nI don't believe it!\nWhat?\nTHAT!\nThey're back!\nNice outfits. Post-it's must be really lucrative!\nRomy, are you sure you wanna do this?\nOh yeah, Michele. I am SO sure!\nWhat the hell is your problem, Christie? Why the hell are you always such a nasty bitch? I mean, okay, so Michele and I did make up some stupid lie! We only did it because we wanted you to treat us like human beings. But you know what I realized? I don't care if you like us, 'cause we don't like you. You're a bad person with an ugly heart, and we don't give a flying fuck what you think!\nCome on Michele.\nOkay, and... YEAH!\nUnbelievable! They're as deluded about their lives as they are about those HIDEOUS clothes\nActually Christie. They have nice lines. A fun, frisky use of color. All and all, I'd have to say they're really... NOT BAD!\nWell, WE still think they're ridiculous. Don't we girls?\nWhy don't you just let them think for themselves for once?\nYou're just jealous.

It's not working... the battery's dead.\nWait...! What do you mean, it's dead?\nWhat do I mean? I mean the battery's dead. The battery's dead!\nNo, no! What do you mean, the battery's dead?\nHow can I explain this to you differently? The battery is dead. It ceased to live. It's deceased now. The car needs a battery to start, Saul.\nHow did this happen?\nWell we clearly fell asleep with the battery on and-...\nAw, man... Talk radio?\nYes, talk radio.\nSo boring, man! The car just committed suicide.\nI wish I had a job like that. Where I could just sit around and smoke weed all day\nHey you do have that job. You do sit around and smoke weed all day.\nHey you're right. Hey thanks man.\nBFFF?\nBest Fuckin' Friends Forever, man!\nIt's almost a shame to smoke it. It's like killing a unicorn... with, like, a bomb.\nThis is like if that Blue Oyster shit met that Afghan Kush I had - and they had a baby. And then, meanwhile, that crazy Northern Light stuff I had and the Super Red Espresso Snowflake met and had a baby. And by some miracle, those two babies met and fucked - this would the shit that they birthed.\nWow. This is the product of baby fucking.\nHow about in the park, when I said you were my friend... you didn't say anything back.\nWell, that's easy. It's because we're not friends. You are my drug dealer. The only reason I know you is because I like the drugs you sell. If you didn't sell drugs, I would have no idea who you are, and I wouldn't be here right now. I would be fantastic!\nOh.\nI'm sorry, that sounded really mean... just to hear that, that sounded really mean.\nNo, I see. The monkey's out of the bottle now!\nWhat? That's not even... a figure of speech.\nPandora can't go back into the box - he only comes out.\nI go visit her in high school and all the guys she goes to school with are, like, strong and handsome and really, like, funny and do good impressions of Jeff Goldblum and shit like that. And, like, I just feel like a fat, dumb fuckin' stinky-ass turd when I'm there.\nWhat?\nIt sucks for my ego.\nFuck Jeff Goldblum, man!\nEnjoy your last meal.\nHere, supersize it, bitch.\nEven if he found that roach, how could he find us?\nUm... heat-seeking missiles... bloodhounds... and foxes... barracudas...\nI'm just - I'm kind of flabbergasted when you say things like that. It's weird.\nThank you.\nNot a compliment.\nWhat's down there, a fucking Rancor?\nHoly cock!\nThere's a fly in the ointment, shits hittin' the fan, the lion will speak!\nI thought hurricane season was over!\nWhat's up with the suit?\nOh, I'm a process server, so I have to wear a suit.\nWow, you're a servant? Like a butler? A chauffeur?\nNo, no. What? No, I'm not like-...\nShine shoes?\nI'm a *process server*!\nDo you know what today is?\nTuesday.\nThis is my cat's birthday today.\nI don't see a cat in here. I'm sorry. Did you let it out by accident?\nNo, because he died three months ago, okay? So now who's the funny guy?\nI'm sorry?\nToday is his birthday and it is a tradition that on his birthday I get up extra early and make him his favorite kind of dessert.\nDon't worry, bro. Your cat's going to heaven.\nYeah, maybe. Maybe he went to heaven. He was a little fucker. He could've gone to hell.\nIn case you haven't noticed - which you haven't, 'cause from what I can tell, you don't notice anything ever - we are not very functional when we're high.\nWell, I don't know, man. I think I'm functioning right now. I was, like, stoned when I saved you with those slushies. What do you gotta say to that?\nWell, that would be true if you had saved me. But you didn't save me. She was gonna help us, but you made things worse. Now we're wanted for all sorts of crazy shit!\nDon't fucking get on my case, all right? Look, only reason I started selling pot is so I could put my bubbeh in a nice retirement home.\nOh, yeah, she must be proud of you for that.\nShe is really proud of me, and I'm gonna become something, man! As soon as she dies, I'm gonna become a civil engineer. I'm gonna design septic tanks for playgrounds. Little kids can take shits! You idiot, what the hell do you do?\nHey, look: it's like my thumb is my cock.\nThat's not gonna get us a ride, man.\nWell be careful, man. Be careful. Wear shoes in the house. Safety. Safety first, then teamwork.\nI think we should stay!\nWhy?\n...Cause I'm in the dumpster already!\nWhat the fuck is this thing?\nAh. Cross joint.\nYeah.\nYou ever smoke one of those?\nYou can SMOKE this?\nHell yeah, man!\nNo.\nThis. Is. The future, this is like the apex of the vortex of joint engineering. It's rumored that M. M. O'Shaughnessy designed the first one - the guy who, uh, designed the Golden Gate Bridge. My second favorite civil engineer behind Hannskarl Bandel: Madison Square Garden... What you do is you light all three ends at the same time...\nReally?\nand then the smoke converges, creating a TRIFECTA of joint-smoking power. This is it, man. This is what your grandchildren are gonna be smoking. Future. That - future...\nYou don't think I can handle danger?\nWhat are you talking about?\nYou can.\nI totally can. And for you to come into my house and not tell secrets because you think you're saving me, well, in reality it just makes you look like a dumbass, cause look at this.\nYou see this? You see that? There's no hair under here, bro.\nWhat's the significance of that?\nIt makes me aerodynamic when I fight. I can take danger.\nI'm gonna get us out of here!\nNo, you're not. But it's okay.\nWhen my foot was in the hole - and my groin - man, I felt like a wishbone.\nJust sit back and get ready to enjoy some of the rarest weed known to mankind.\nIt's really that rare?\nIt's, like, the rarest.\nIt's almost a shame to smoke it. It's like killing a unicorn... with, like, a bomb.\nYou're in the jungle now, Baby!\nYou know you gonna die right?\nYeah...\nI'm gonna kill the fuck out you... I hope you enjoy these last... 17 minutes of your life... cause when Ted gets here, he's gonna be like, 'Kill that motha fucker, kill that motha fuckin ass'... watch your head!\nMan, why'd we have to go to the woods?\nWell you didn't come up with any ideas!\nYeah, I came up with two! Nowhere and Quizno's.\nHey, man, what happened to your lip?\nYeah... it looks like you've been crying or something...\nUm, actually, my lip, that's a cold sore. And I've never had a cold sore before, so I cried.\nDude, a cold sore? Does that mean like... herpes?\nYes, that's what it means. I have herpes.\nHerpes... Whoa, do you know how many, like, joints we've shared?\nYes, I know, I'm a disgusting person.\nHello? Hey, man.\nWhat the fuck? I didn't buzz you in. How the monkey did you get in here?\nOh, shit, some guy with a faux 'hawk let me in. He was leaving when I was-...\nFuckin' Kyle, man?\nIt might've been Kyle.\nThat asshole.\nI'm sorry.\nWhat the fuck's the buzzer for, anyway?\nI don't know. I'm sorry about that. I don't know your protocol yet.\nHe fucking killed him!\nWho killed who?\nA cop, a lady, and a guy!\nA cop, a lady, and a guy, man? That's like a massacre. You saw it?\nNo, it was just a guy!\nWhat happened to the lady?\nYou lied to me.\nI did. I lied big time to you.\nDale said that that you didn't even have herpes, and I said that you did.\nHonestly, like, from now on, just, like, from everything that we've gone through, from, like, seeing this fuckin' asshole's nuts smashed with my Daewoo, I want to be a better friend to you. I really do.\nI fuckin' love you, dog. I fuckin' love you.\nI wanna be inside you, homes.\nNo more lies, Red.\nThis is my moment.\nThis is your moment.\nYou killed my ear!\nYou shot me!\nI didn't do that!\nHE shot me!\nYou shot him?\nnods his head\nGet your hands off me!\nShut up! we've had enough of you!\nI'm not your friend!\nI'm cold...\nYou're cold?

That like a massacre, man!\nOh, wow, you got a cute picture.\nOh, yeah, me and my bubbeh. Hey, let me ask you something. Do you think you could pull the plug on someone if you needed to? Like euthanasia?\nLike on her?\nIf I needed to.\nUm... I'm kind of in a hurry, man. I don't know if we should start going down that road. I could talk all day about euthanasia. Don't get me started.\nWell, save it!\nWe'll save it for next time. We'll keep it going.\nI wish we could just go nowhere.\nHey, what's up, dudes?\nWhat's up?

Hit it up, dude!\nRelax, man, just sit back and get ready to enjoy some of the rarest weed known to man.\nIt's really that rare?\nIt's like the rarest. It's almost a shame to smoke it. It's like... killin' a unicorn... with, like, a bomb...\nAre you the only guy in town who has this? You're actually the only guy?\nYeah. My guy Red said he was givin' me an exclusive sneak preview.\nAnd am I the only guy who you sold it to; the other guys got snicklefritz?\nYeah.

I wish I had that...\nAre you kidd - you do, you have the easiest job on Earth. You DO smoke weed all day.\n...Hahaha, that's true!\nYou didn't think of that, huh?\nI do have a good job...\nYeah, you do nothing!\nThanks, man!\nNo problem.\nThank you.\nHerpes is for life, bro!\nYeah, well, I'm gonna try to definitely put some sort of medical ointment on it. I've been takin Vicodin; that really doesn't take down the swelling, though.\nIt's from that time. I told you, man! You wanted to eat that lollipop out of that stripper's snatch! You wanted to do it!\nOut of her vagina, I know! Remember what you did? What'd you do?\nNothing.\nYou ate a box of Nerds outta her butt-hoooole.\nWhoa! What the fuck was that?\nI was trying to hit that tree. I missed.\nWhat tree?\nThat one.\nWhy didn't you smash it on a rock like a normal person like I did?\nI don't know! How often does somebody smash things? I'm rusty, fuck.\nOh, man, did you at least see where it landed?\nI don't know. Just call it.\nCall it? With what? My phone has been smashed!\nY'know, I bet they can't even triangulate those things.\nWell, you shouldn't have said anything, because now you convinced me they can! You were very convincing back there!\nOkay, okay. Fine, I'll go find it. Fuck.\nDo you see it?\nSee what?\nThe phone, you idiot!\nI'm here to save my best friend... I've got an idea! Rub your wrists against my belt buckle!\nI'm gonna save you, man!\nYeah! Yeah!\nLet me save you!\nSmell it. SMELL it! Enjoy. It's like... God's vagina!\nUhhh!\nWhat, do you wanna bathe in it?\nI just want to live in here!\nYes, you wanna be it?\nOh, my God, I just wanna shove it up my nose and have that smell all day. That's amazing! It's beautiful!\nShove it anywhere you like!\nWhat's it called?\nPineapple Express.\nYeah I know where he lives, what are you insinuating, that I'm forgetful?\nInsinuating...\nYeah you know what that means? It means like...\nI do what that means actually.\n...to seem like.\nOkay here's what you do. You equip yourself...\nI'm equipping! Equip me, sir!\nWhat you do... is you light all three ends at the same, and the smoke converges, creating a *trifecta* of joint-smoking power. This is it, man. This is what your grandchildren are gonna be smoking. Future, that future.\nSee, Dale here, is a... protest servant, and...\nNo, I'm not. That's not who I am.\nTIME OUT!

    "59": "How is that not the worse news?\nThe laptop situation really only affects you, whereas the White Castle situation affects us both equally.\nNeil, you wouldn't happen to know how to get on the highway from here, would you?\nDude, I don't even know where the fuck I am right now. I was at this party earlier tonight and some guy hooked me up with this incredible \"X\" - next thing I know I'm being thrown out of a moving car. I've been trippin' balls ever since.\nThat's crazy, dude. We've been having a pretty crazy, night, too. We've just been driving around looking for White Castle but we keep getting sidetracked.\nYeah, dude, you fascinate me. Forget White Castle, let's go get some pussy!\nHuh?\nIt's a fucking sausage fest in here, bros. Let's get some poontang, THEN we'll go to White Castle.\nNo, Neil, you don't understand. We've been craving these burgers all night.\nYeah, I've been craving burgers, too. Furburgers. Come on, dudes, let's pick up some trim at a strip club. The Doogie line always works on strippers.\nLapdance...\nThere's a gas station. I'm gonaa see if I can get some directions.\nYou don't need dir- gah! Hurry up, dudes, hurry up! I'm losing wood.\nHurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry...\nLook, chill.\nWe'll be right back, Neil.\nDude, what is the deal with Neil Patrick Harris? Why is he so horny?\nRold? Is that you?\nKumar?\nHey, are the cops still here?\nWhat the hell are you doing?\nI just called and made up some story about a shooting in Millbrook Park.\nJesus Christ! What'd you do that for?\nI'm fucking starving! I figured I'd bust you out and we'd go get some burgers.\nAhh.\n'Scuse me, I just...\nHuh?\nI have to ask you, why'd you... wha... wha... why are you peeing... right here?\nWhat?\nI mean... why'd you pee right next to me when you could like, choose that bush, or...\nWell, this bush looked like I should pee on it. Why are you peeing on it?\nWell, no one was here when I chose this bush.\nOh, so you get to pee on it and no one else does? Huh?\nNo, it's just... I just...\nThis your bush? You have a special bond with this bush?\nNo, I just thought that...\nYou the king of the forest?\nI'm sorry?\nWhat?\nYou fuckin' tree-hugger. IS THIS YOUR SPECIAL BUSH?\nNever mind. Forget it, I really don't feel like gettin' stabbed tonight.\nNice pubes.\nThanks.\nDude, where's my car?\nWhere's his car, dude?\nWhat the hell are you doing with my wife?\nY-you said outside that we could have sex with her!\nShit! Shit!\nI most certainly did not!\nYes you did!\nDid not!\nYes you did!\nOh, no, I didn't.\nYou did, you did.\nYou sure...?\nYou said it!\nMy mistake! Well, since we're all here... How 'bout a four-some?\nDing-dong! May I interject for a second? As a Burger Shack employee for the past three years, if there's one thing I've learned, it's that if you're craving White Castle, the burgers here just don't cut it. In fact, just thinking about those tender little White Castle burgers with those little, itty-bitty grilled onions that just explode in your mouth like flavor crystals every time you bite into one... just makes me want to burn this motherfucker down. Come on, Pookie, let's burn this motherfucker down! Come on, Pookie! Let's burn it, Pookie! Let's burn this motherfucker down! Let's burn it down! Let's burn it! So you guys maybe should just suck it up and go to White Castle.\nYou can always get your work done in the car.\nLet's do it.\nAll right. Awesome. Then listen, listen - no matter what, we are not ending this night without White Castle in our stomachs. Agreed?\nAgreed.\nWise choice. You guys might have wanted to stay away from our special sauce tonight. Me and Pookie, we added a secret ingredient. I'll give you a hint. It's semen.\nSemen.\nAnimal semen.\nRoldy! Roldy! dude, you gotta come quick. There is these two filthy pussies just aching to get boned by us!\nI mean... duh... that there are these two lovely young pussies who would like to have a chat with you and I.\nDo you actually believe that after the way you've just behaved that I would even consider recommending you for admission?\nNo. I'm gonna be honest with you. The only reason I'm applying is so my dad will keep paying for my apartment. I really don't have a desire to go to med school.\nBut you have perfect MCAT scores!\nYeah, just cause you're hung like a moose doesn't mean you gotta do porn.\nHey, what's that smell?\nWhat smell? Kumar...\n\nHey Kumar! Kumar! Where are you...\nKumar! Still in jail, asshole! Come here!\nDo you know what the hell we had to go through after you took the car?\nYeah, it was a dick move on my part. That's why I'm paying for your meal. Prick.\nHere's 50 for the meal, and 200 for the car.\nWhat happened to my car?\nI made some love stains in the back. You'll see...\nDude, we're so high right now!\nWe're not low!\nGo on inside, boys, and make yourselves at home. You can rest up, get something to drink, fuck my wife, whatever you want. Just don't do anything the good lord would'nt do.\nDude am I going deaf or did he just say we could fuck his wife?\nDude, am I really high, or is this actually working?\nBoth.\nSo she's kinda fucking cute. Let her touch your penis.\nI forgot my cell phone.\nYou wanna run back and get it?\nNo, we've gone too far.\nHow were Katie Holmes' tits?\nYou know the Holocaust?\nYeah?\nPicture the opposite of that!\nNice!\nWhat kind of name is that anyhow? Kumar? What is that five o's or two u's?\nNo, it's actually one \"u\"\nYeah, bullshit.\nWhat the hell are you doing? Gawd!\nYou been out cold for the past half an hour. I figured maybe if I did some gay shit, you'd wake up.\nIf you did some gay shit? What kinda - where are we? Didn't we come here on a cheetah? Where's the cheetah?\nIt ran away. Listen, forget about the cheetah, okay?\nAre those my scissors? Dude, I trim my nose hair with those!\nDude, I've been cutting my ass hair with them for the past six months.\nLet's find us some tunes baby,\nCole's extreme mix volume 5, what is this shit?\nThese guys are fucking posers!\nThank you, come again!\nI hope you are here to apologize for what you did at your interview this afternoon.\nWhat the hell's wrong with you, Kumar? God! You're, like, 22 years old. I mean, when are you going to stop this post-college rebel baloney? Like your life's so hard.\nEat my balls, Saikat.\nI will not tolerate this business from you any longer. You have one more interview tomorrow morning, and if I hear from Dr. Wein that you are anything short of spectacular, I'll completely cut you off!\nDad, come on.\nDaddy is not coming on anything! You will be there, and you will behave. I have put too much time and energy into you to let you go and fuck it all up!\n...The universe tends to unfold as it should.\nWhat is that? Some fortune cookie?\nI want that.\nWhat? A Hot Dog Heaven super chili cheese dog?\nNo. I want that feeling. The feeling that comes over a man when he gets exactly what he desires. I need that feeling!\nAre you saying what I think you're saying?\nWe gotta go to White Castle.\nYES! YES! I knew you had it in you dude!\nI can't believe you were gonna ditch for the Joy Luck Club, dude. You know what their parties are like.\nC'mon, what did you want me to say? I was under pressure.\nJust say no. That's all it takes.\nHere.\nTake a hit of that.\nHere, that's sixt - 80 bucks.\n80 bucks?\nYeah, 80 bucks.\nYo, this is worth 40 tops bro!\nBro? I'm not your bro, bro. ok, and that's 80 bucks. You don't feel like getting high tonight? If you don't feel like getting high, that's cool with me because there's lots of people around here. See this guy? Hey, what's up, George? I smoke buds with George all the time.\nWhat kind of a hippie are you?\nWhat kind of hippie am I? Man, I'm a business hippie, I understand the concept of supply and demand.\nNow we're in Newark, of all places. You know we're gonna get shot.\nMaybe it's not as bad as they say. Maybe it's just a bunch of hype.\nCheck it out. Those guys look like a lame version of us.\n, :\nHoly shit!\n, :\nHoly shit!\nLet's get the fuck outta here. Go! Go! Drive! Drive!\nYeah, that was your fault.\nFuck you.\nFuck you.\nOh, nice. 16 Candles is on, man.\nAnd the award for the least heterosexual statement ever made in this apartment goes to... Harold Lee! Come on down, man! Take a bow!\nShut up, man. It's a classic.\nI am so hungry. I'm gonna eat, like, 20 of those burgers, man.\nDude, fuckin' I will see your 20 burgers and raise you 5 orders of fries.\nHang on a second, nurse. What we should probably use is marijuana. That'll sufficiently sedate the patient for surgery.\nMarijuana?... But why?\nWe don't have time for questions. We need marijuana now, as much of it as possible! Like a big bag of it.\nCheck out those boils on his neck! You gotta look! One of them is actually pulsating!\nWill you shut up? He's right next to me! He can hear you!\nUgh! Now there's some sort of Puss! Just look!\n\nSee? Isn't that the most disgusting thing you've ever seen?\nYou think that just because you're whispering he can't hear what you are saying? He's two feet away from us! He can hear this entire conversation! He can hear me talking... right now!\nDon't worry about it, he can't hear anything. Not with all that crust in his ear.\nI heard everything you said.\nHey, why don't you leave that guy alone and go jerk off to some snowboarding videos or something?\nSo where you going to go now, Neil?\nWherever God takes me!\nSo, I gotta ask you Neil, did you ever get it on with Wanda off the set?\nDude, I humped every piece of ass ever on that show.\nEven the chick who played the hot nurse?\nNo... I didn't go all the way with her.\nIs there... is there a problem, Officer... Palumbo?\nIs there a problem? Have you heard of jaywalking?\nYes, I have. I'm really sorry. It won't happen again.\nThat's great. I'm writing you up a ticket.\nA ticket? Are you serious?\nWho the fuck are you, shitwad?\n$220? Are you crazy? Excuse me, Officer sir! Let me just take a few guesses here!\nI'm really sorry for this...\nNo sudden movements! Back it up!\nYou were probably the big asshole in high school, right?\nAbsolutely right.\nAnd you used to pick on guys like us everyday for fun?\nWith pleasure.\nBut then graduation day came! We went to college, while you went nowhere. And then you began to think to yourself, \"Gee. How can I still give them grief? Oh, I know, I'll just become a cop.\" Yeah? Well, congratulations! Your dream has come true! Now, why don't you just take this quiet little Asian guy with the American name that treats you so well and give him some more tickets or better just take him to jail.\nEven better.\nYou're going downtown thanks to your friend here.\nOh, great American name, Harold!\nYaaah!\nHuh.\nOh, shoot.\nExcuse me officer. Let me take a couple of guesses. You were probably the big asshole in your high school, right?\nAbsolutely right.\nUsed to pick on guys like us every day, right?\nWith pleasure.\nThen graduation day came, and we went to college, and you went nowhere, and you thought, \"Hey, how can I still give them shit? I know, I'll become a cop.\"\nShotgun anus!\nI want 30 sliders, 5 french fries, and 4 large cherry cokes.\nI want the same except make mine diet cokes.\nHey Roldy?\nWhat?\nThere's something I forgot to tell you.\nWhat?\nI never hang-glided before.\nWHAT?\nWell, congratu-fuckin'-lations, your dream has come true!\nDude, am I going deaf or did he just say we could fuck his wife?\n\nAh!

You can rest up, get something to drink, fuck my wife, whatever you want. Just don't do anything Jesus wouldn't!\nDid he just say we could fuck his wife?\nWe should give this man some marijuana. Nurse! Get all the medical marijuana you can! Like a big bag of it?\nMarijuana?... But why?\nKumar: My names Kumar.\nFreakshow:\nHow are you, Kenny?\nKumar:\nUm... And this is Harold.\nFreakshow: Hi, Gerald how are you?\nBitch! Learn how to fuckin' make coffee, you fucking whore!\nHow is that not the worse news?\nThe laptop situation really only affects you, whereas the White Castle situation affects us both equally.\nNeil, you wouldn't happen to know how to get on the highway from here, would you?\nDude, I don't even know where the fuck I am right now.

Some fortune cookie?\nI want that.\nWhat? A Hot Dog Heaven super chili cheese dog?\nNo. I want that feeling. The feeling that comes over a man when he gets exactly what he desires. I need that feeling!\nAre you saying what I think you're saying?\nWe gotta go to White Castle.\nYES! YES! I knew you had it in you dude!\nI can't believe you were gonna ditch for the Joy Luck Club, dude. You know what their parties are like.\nC'mon, what did you want me to say? I was under pressure.\nJust say no. That's all it takes.\nHere.\nTake a hit of that.\nHere, that's sixt - 80 bucks.\n80 bucks?\nYeah, 80 bucks.\nYo, this is worth 40 tops bro!\nBro? I'm not your bro, bro. ok, and that's 80 bucks. You don't feel like getting high tonight? If you don't feel like getting high, that's cool with me because there's lots of people around here. See this guy? Hey, what's up, George? I smoke buds with George all the time.\nWhat kind of a hippie are you?\nWhat kind of hippie am I? Man, I'm a business hippie, I understand the concept of supply and demand.\nNow we're in Newark, of all places. You know we're gonna get shot.\nMaybe it's not as bad as they say. Maybe it's just a bunch of hype.\nCheck it out. Those guys look like a lame version of us.\n, :\nHoly shit!\n, :\nHoly shit!\nLet's get the fuck outta here. Go! Go! Drive! Drive!\nYeah, that was your fault.\nFuck you.\nFuck you.\nOh, nice. 16 Candles is on, man.\nAnd the award for the least heterosexual statement ever made in this apartment goes to... Harold Lee! Come on down, man! Take a bow!\nShut up, man. It's a classic.\nI am so hungry. I'm gonna eat, like, 20 of those burgers, man.\nDude, fuckin' I will see your 20 burgers and raise you 5 orders of fries.\nHang on a second, nurse. What we should probably use is marijuana. That'll sufficiently sedate the patient for surgery.\nMarijuana?... But why?\nWe don't have time for questions. We need marijuana now, as much of it as possible! Like a big bag of it.\nCheck out those boils on his neck! You gotta look! One of them is actually pulsating!\nWill you shut up? He's right next to me! He can hear you!\nUgh! Now there's some sort of Puss! Just look!\n\nSee? Isn't that the most disgusting thing you've ever seen?\nYou think that just because you're whispering he can't hear what you are saying? He's two feet away from us! He can hear this entire conversation! He can hear me talking... right now!\nDon't worry about it, he can't hear anything. Not with all that crust in his ear.\nI heard everything you said.\nHey, why don't you leave that guy alone and go jerk off to some snowboarding videos or something?\nSo where you going to go now, Neil?\nWherever God takes me!\nSo, I gotta ask you Neil, did you ever get it on with Wanda off the set?\nDude, I humped every piece of ass ever on that show.\nEven the chick who played the hot nurse?\nNo... I didn't go all the way with her.\nIs there... is there a problem, Officer... Palumbo?\nIs there a problem? Have you heard of jaywalking?\nYes, I have. I'm really sorry. It won't happen again.\nThat's great. I'm writing you up a ticket.\nA ticket? Are you serious?\nWho the fuck are you, shitwad?\n$220? Are you crazy? Excuse me, Officer sir! Let me just take a few guesses here!\nI'm really sorry for this...\nNo sudden movements! Back it up!\nYou were probably the big asshole in high school, right?\nAbsolutely right.\nAnd you used to pick on guys like us everyday for fun?\nWith pleasure.\nBut then graduation day came! We went to college, while you went nowhere. And then you began to think to yourself, \"Gee. How can I still give them grief? Oh, I know, I'll just become a cop.\" Yeah? Well, congratulations! Your dream has come true! Now, why don't you just take this quiet little Asian guy with the American name that treats you so well and give him some more tickets or better just take him to jail.\nEven better.\nYou're going downtown thanks to your friend here.\nOh, great American name, Harold!\nYaaah!\nHuh.\nOh, shoot.\nExcuse me officer. Let me take a couple of guesses. You were probably the big asshole in your high school, right?\nAbsolutely right.\nUsed to pick on guys like us every day, right?\nWith pleasure.\nThen graduation day came, and we went to college, and you went nowhere, and you thought, \"Hey, how can I still give them shit? I know, I'll become a cop.\"\nShotgun anus!\nI want 30 sliders, 5 french fries, and 4 large cherry cokes.\nI want the same except make mine diet cokes.\nHey Roldy?\nWhat?\nThere's something I forgot to tell you.\nWhat?\nI never hang-glided before.\nWHAT?\nWell, congratu-fuckin'-lations, your dream has come true!\nDude, am I going deaf or did he just say we could fuck his wife?\n\nAh! AH! What the hell are you doing?\nYou've been out cold for the past half hour, I figured if I did some gay shit you'd wake up.\nGo on inside, boys, and make yourselves at home. You can rest up, get something to drink, fuck my wife, whatever you want. Just don't do anything Jesus wouldn't!\nDid he just say we could fuck his wife?\nWe should give this man some marijuana. Nurse! Get all the medical marijuana you can! Like a big bag of it?\nMarijuana?... But why?\nKumar: My names Kumar.\nFreakshow:\nHow are you, Kenny?\nKumar:\nUm... And this is Harold.\nFreakshow: Hi, Gerald how are you?\nBitch! Learn how to fuckin' make coffee, you fucking whore!\nI fear that I will always be / A lonely number like root three / A three is all that's good and right, / Why must my three keep out of sight / Beneath a vicious square root sign, / I wish instead I were a nine / For nine could thwart this evil trick, / with just some quick arithmetic / I know I'll never see the sun, as 1.7321 / Such is my reality, a sad irrationality / When hark! What is this I see, / Another square root of a three / Has quietly come waltzing by, / Together now we multiply / To form a number we prefer, / Rejoicing as an integer / We break free from our mortal bonds / And with a wave of magic wands / Our square root signs become unglued / And love for me has been renewed.\nSo you get high and you put other people who smoke weed in jail?\nDUH!\nThat's so hypocritical!\nOh yeah? Well let me ask you something, Kumar, do you like giving hand jobs?\nNo sir.\nDo you like gettin' hand jobs?\nHeh, yeah.\nYeah well, that makes you a fuckin' hypocriticizer too, so shut the fuck up! Now smoke my weed.\nIt's because of assholes like you that we're even in this fucking place - fucking cowards!\nWell maybe if the people in your country stopped eating *doughnuts* and started realizing what their government is doing to the world, \"assholes\" like us wouldn't exist!\nFuck you! Doughnuts are awesome!\nAnyway, last day of shooting, I told her. I said... \"T-Bird, we're gonna have to break up.\"\nWhy did you do that?\nI didn't think I could take on that kind of responsibility. It was such a big mistake.\nWhy? I mean, with T-Bird gone, couldn't you have sex with whoever you wanted?\nLet me be clear. There is nothing on the planet that I love more than a hot, new pussy.\nSure.\nNothing. What does the P.H. Stands for in N.P.H?\nPatrick Harris.\nNo, common mistake. Poon handler.\nI've never had to suck a dick before.\nMe neither.\nI bet it sucks dick!\nYou remember that time that you broke into the animal lab and like stole that monkey and put it in Andy Rosenberg's dorm room?\nFirst of all, that was Goldstein's idea, and second of all, had I known that the monkey had AIDS, I never would've done that.\nThat looks like Osama Bin Laden's beard!\nYo, I'm not joining the mile high club with you!\nWhat about the really high club?\nIn less than eight hours we're gonna be in Amsterdam. This is nuts. This is nuts!\nI know, dude. It's gonna be exactly like Eurotrip only it's not going to suck. It's going to be awesome.\nIt's not not going to be awesome.\nI have a lost love story of my own.\nOh yeah?\nI'll never forget her. Her name was Tashonda. She was Whoopi Goldberg's stand-in. Her skin was so soft, her lips were so sweet. She had these tiny little Hershey kisses nipples that you just wanted to suck on all night long. Anyway, last day of shooting I told her. I said \"T-Bird, we're gonna have to break up\".\nWhy'd you do that?\nI didn't think I could take on that kind of responsibility. What a big mistake!\n\nThe point is boys, even though I loved having sex with some hot random trim, a day hasn't gone by where I haven't thought of Tashonda. Every time I see a bag of Hershey kisses, my balls get so wet.\nSir, I need you to step aside please. I need to search you.\nDid I beep?\nOh no, you didn't beep. Just a random security check. If you can just step aside, please. Just over here.\nRandom, huh?\nYeah.\nSo this has nothing to do with my ethnicity?\nCome on, just do what the guy says.\nSir, it's our job as airport security to search for all possible weapons or illegal drugs.\nSo just because of the color of my skin you assume that I have drugs on me? Are you a racist?\nRacist? Dude, I'm black!\nHe's black! He's not racist!\nPlease, dude. You're barely even brown. Compared to me, you look like Matthew Perry.\nNo...!\nHey, who you callin' Matthew Perry, bitch?\nI'm calling you Matthew Perry, you Matthew Perry-looking bitch!\nHarold Lee, I'd like to introduce you to an invention of mine.\nMeet the smokeless bong.\nYou made this?\nYou know I did. When you were slaving away at work, I was actually being a productive member of society.\nAre all the guards in Guantanamo Bay gay?\nFuck no! There ain't nothing gay about getting your dick sucked! You're the ones that're gay for sucking my dick!\nWhat?\nIn fact, it creeps me out just being around you fags! Alright, get down on your knees and open your mouths.\nWhy don't you kick our asses instead?\nGET ON YOUR FUCKING KNEES NOW!\nHope you boys like extra mayo.\nWhat's up with this party?\nWhat do you mean?\nThere's exposed vagina all over your house.\nOh, yeah, that was my idea. I don't know about you guys - I'm sick of all the hype over topless.\nReally? I always liked topless.\nYeah, well I'm starting the bottomless trend! Hence the bottomless party.\nThis car is frickin' sweet!\nOh yeah! Yeah, it's sweet! 'Cuz we're fugitives. Driving a yellow convertible with the top down, dressed like assholes!\nOh God, dude!\nWhat the fuck? What the fuck? What are you doing?\nI'm taking the most incredible dump of all time, man.\nYou couldn't wait until I got out of the shower?\nUm, may I remind you that we both just ate 30 burgers and 4 large orders of fries?\nDon't worry, in a little bit I'm sure it'll hit you too.\nMaybe, but I'm going to wait until you get out of the shower!\nWell don't wait too long. We gotta leave for the airport in an hour.\nAn hour?\nUh-huh. Oh, hey, Roldy?\nYeah?\nNice pubes.\nWhy does everything has to be a huge argument with you, man?\nBecause this is America, dude, and as long as I have my freedom of speech no one's going to shut me up.\nI'm telling you Jorge, the first thing you have to do when you get to America - buy a device called TiVo. Okay? Freedom means nothing if you're a slave to regular programming. I promise you that.\nDid you take calculus in high school or something?\nNo, actually my dad taught me in sixth grade.\nWhat are you, like Doogie Howser?\nNo. Although that would be incredible. He's my hero. I love that show.\nThe other night I ended up at that Asian party and I shtupped Cindy Kim!\nShut the fuck up! Are you serious?\nYeah man, she even gave me a blumpkin!\nWhat is a blumpkin?\nIt's when a girl gives you head while you're sitting on the toilet taking a shit!\nLook how cute this deer is, dude. Not like those asshole deer in New Jersey.\nHey, you don't happen to have a Baby Ruth on you, do you?\nNo. Why do you need a Baby Ruth?\nThat's how Chunk got over with Sloth in The Goonies.\nThis thing looks like Sloth?\nAll I saw was the creature's hand.\nThe hand looks like Sloth?\nThe fucking hand of an evil monster, dude. Like claws and shit!\nI thought you were joking when you said that you have an inbred son who lives in your basement?\nWell it ain't a joke! Raylene and I here are siblings. And we get it on. But that don't mean we oughtta be judged!\nI have this fantasy...\nWhat is it?\nI thought it would be kind of cool to bring someone else in bed with us?\nWho?\nHey baby.\nIs that a KKK bonfire?\nYeah, I think it is.\nMaybe we should get the fuck out of here.\nThanks for stopping.\nNo problem.\nNeil?\nGary and Kumar!\nWhat are you doing here, man?\nThis is where God took me.\nCan you focus on the driving? Focus on the road. You've had dozens of shrooms, my friend.\nUh, dude, I was able to perform an apendectomy at age 14. I think I can handle a couple of mushrooms.\nWasn't that just the TV show?\nHoly fucking shit that was awesome!\nTry having that conversation on shrooms. I deserve an Oscar for that performance!\nYou do!\nDudes, I'm going to take a little detour on the way, alright?\nNo, Neil, no. We're almost there, man.\nNo buts! No buts! I'm going to a whorehouse and I'm gonna get my fuck on! If you two don't want to get your dicks wet, that's fine with me!\nWe gotta get Neil!\nWhy?\nWe're stealing his car! We can't leave him back there!\nHe stole your fucking car last week!\nI fucked up, okay? And I always fuck up. I am a fuck up!\nYou think?\nHarold, you're my best friend, dude. You mean the world to me, man. I love you.\nQueers.\nAnd I promise you if we figure out a way to get out of this, I'm gonna change, okay? It's not just going to be about Kumar all the time. It's going to be about Kumar and Harold.\nHarold and Kumar.\nI kind of like the first way better.\nOh man, that was so fucking extreme!\nLook, I can't promise you the kind of lifestyle that Colton could. I can't promise you that I'll mature over night. But what I can promise you is...\nSorry, I smoked weed with the president and I totally forgot what I was going to say.\nLadies and Roldy, how would you like to get really fucking high since we're in Amsterdam?\nYeah.\nShall we?\nSounds like a plan.\n, :\nLet's do it!\n, :\nLet's do it!\nYou guys wanna hear something fucked up and awesome? I took a Korean guy's toothbrush and I rubbed it all over my dick!\nYou did that?\nYou fucking pissed on me you racist fuck!\nHey, I ran into Todd at Whitaker's, of course. He told me, uh, you got a job working for the government!\nYeah! Yeah, President Bush and my dad were in the same fraternity!\nOh, sheesh.\nWhen he gave my dad that appointment in the Defense Department, I became his right hand man.\nDouche.\nDude, this thing is huge!

But, I do not believe we will get Eddie Van Halen until we have a triumphant video.\nTed, it's pointless to have a triumphant video before we even have decent instruments.\nWell, how can we have decent instruments when we don't really even know how to play?\nThat is why we NEED Eddie Van Halen!\nAnd THAT is why we need a triumphant video.\n, :\nEXCELLENT!\n, :\nEXCELLENT!\nUh oh, we're late!\nFor what?\nFor school, dude!\nOh yeah.\nIt's you!\nYeah!

You know what that would mean, don't ya, Ted?\nThat I would have to go to Oates Military Acadamy, sir.\nUh-huh. I spoke to Colonel Oates this morning. He's anxious to meet you, Ted.\nTed, what in the hell do you think you're doing?\nTrash can... remember a trash can!\nTrash can?

I fell out of my suit when I hit the floor.\n, :\n\nFag!\n, :\n\nFag!\nTed, while I agree that, in time, our band will be most triumphant. The truth is, Wyld Stallyns will never be a super band until we have Eddie Van Halen on guitar.\nYes, Bill. But, I do not believe we will get Eddie Van Halen until we have a triumphant video.\nTed, it's pointless to have a triumphant video before we even have decent instruments.\nWell, how can we have decent instruments when we don't really even know how to play?\nThat is why we NEED Eddie Van Halen!\nAnd THAT is why we need a triumphant video.\n, :\nEXCELLENT!\n, :\nEXCELLENT!\nUh oh, we're late!\nFor what?\nFor school, dude!\nOh yeah.\nIt's you!\nYeah! It's us!\nWho are we?\nBill, I think they want us to say something.\nWhat should I say?\nMake something up.\nBe excellent to each other.\nParty on, dudes!\nGood one, dude.\nWell, we gotta get back to our report.\nYeah. We'd take you with us, but it's a history report, not a future report.\nLater.\nLater.\nTed?\nI'm in love, dude.\nWhoa. Those must be the princesses you told yourself about at the Circle-K. We gotta go. It's a history report, not a babe report.\nBut, Bill, those are historical babes.\nOkay, you're the ladies' man. How we gonna meet 'em?\nHere's the deal. What I win, I keep. What you win, I keep.\n, :\nSounds good, Mr. The Kid!\n, :\nSounds good, Mr. The Kid!\nNot bad, eh, Socrates?

What am I gonna do with you, huh? You can't be...\nGreat.\nYou lose my keys, you fail history, you spend all your time with your loser friend planning a band that'll never happen. Now, you're not to leave this house again until tommorow morning.\nYes?\nCaptain Logan? This is Deputy Van Halen down at the station.\nDeputy Van Halen?\nI'm new dude - sir. Look, we found your keys. If you want 'em, better come and get 'em.\nWhen I get back from the station, I want you packed and ready to go. Got it?\nWe are in serious trouble. My dad already signed me up, my plane leaves tommorow night.\nOnly if we fail, dude.\n, :\nNo way!\n, :\nNo way!\nUh, Ms. Preston. We'd like you to meet some of our... friends.\nYeah. This is Dave Beeth-Oven.\nAnd, uh, Maxine of Arc, Missy. Herman the Kid.\nBob \"Genghis\" Khan. So-cratz Johnson. Dennis Frood. And, uh, uh... Abraham Lincoln.\nWant a Twinkie, Genghis Khan? Say please! Mmmm...\nI don't think it's gonna work.\nNon?\nTriomphe Napoleon!\nIt's your *MOM* dude!\n, :\nExcellent.\n, :\nExcellent.\nHey, Bill. This is just like Frontierland!\nYeah, but you can get shot here, Ted.\nOh.\nSo just try to act natural.\nOkay. Howdy, partner!\nHowdy.\nWatch out for the horse crap, Ted.\nOh. Thanks, dude.\nWhoa, who's the senorita? She's cute.\nIt's his mom, dude.\n\"Dear Bill and Ted, good luck on the report. Sincerely, Bill S. Preston, Esquire and Ted 'Theodore' Logan.\"\nThat was nice of us.\n\"P.S. Duck!\"\n\nExcellent work, Dude!\nWay to go!\n, :\nCatch you later, Bill and Ted.\n, :\nCatch you later, Bill and Ted.\nThat conversation made more sense this time.\nDude, it's Sigmund Frood.\nHow much time we got left?\nTons. Why?\nExtra credit, dude.\nHow's it goin', Frood-dude?\nYou pack your bags, Ted.\nWhat?\nYou're going to military school, Ted.\nBut, Dad...\nNo, I don't wanna hear it, Ted.\nBut...\nTed!

Hey, we know that name!\nYeah! Hey,\nlook him up. Oh, it's under So-cratz.\nI am the Earl of Preston.\nAnd I am the Duke of Ted.\nOkay, wait, if we were one of Europe's greatest leaders, and we were stranded in San Dimas for one day, where would we go?\n, :\n\nWaterloo!\n, :\n\nWaterloo!\nWhat are you doin' home, Dad?\nI'm looking for my keys.\nOh!\nYou haven't done anything with them, have ya?\nNo, sir.\nI spoke to your principal today, Ted. He said you're failing history.\nMe and Bill...\nHe also said that if fail history, you flunk out of school. You know what that would mean, don't ya, Ted?\nThat I would have to go to Oates Military Acadamy, sir.\nUh-huh. I spoke to Colonel Oates this morning. He's anxious to meet you, Ted.\nTed, what in the hell do you think you're doing?\nTrash can... remember a trash can!\nTrash can? What are you talking about...\nGreetings, my excellent friends.\nDo you know when the Mongols ruled China?\nWell, perhaps we can ask them.\nWhat's that?\nI don't know.\n, :\nSHIT!\n, :\nSHIT!\nExcuse me. When did the Mongols rule China?\nI don't know. I just work here.\nIf only we could go back to two days ago before your dad lost his keys, and steal them.\nWell, why don't we?\nCuz we don't have time, dude.\nWe could do it after the report.\nOh, yeah! Where should we put 'em?\nHow 'bout behind this sign?\nOK... Whoa! It worked!\nRight, so when we're done with the report, we have to remember to do this or else it won't happen... but it did happen!

I led thousands of men into battle with everything from horses and swords to artillery and tanks. I've seen the headwaters of the Nile, and tribes of natives no white man had ever seen before. I've won and lost a dozen fortunes, KILLED MANY MEN and loved only one woman with a passion a FLEA like you could never begin to understand. That's who I am.

You, in the crate! Get your lion butt outta there!\nWhat happened to her?\nLooks like her heart gave out in all the excitement.

What do they call a Big Mac?\nWell, a Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it le Big-Mac.\nLe Big-Mac. Ha ha ha ha. What do they call a Whopper?\nI dunno, I didn't go into Burger King.\nWant some bacon?\nNo man, I don't eat pork.\nAre you Jewish?\nNah, I ain't Jewish, I just don't dig on swine, that's all.\nWhy not?\nPigs are filthy animals. I don't eat filthy animals.\nBacon tastes gooood. Pork chops taste gooood.\nHey, sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie, but I'd never know 'cause I wouldn't eat the filthy motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in shit. That's a filthy animal. I ain't eat nothin' that ain't got sense enough to disregard its own feces.\nHow about a dog? Dogs eats its own feces.\nI don't eat dog either.\nYeah, but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal?\nI wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy but they're definitely dirty. But, a dog's got personality. Personality goes a long way.\nAh, so by that rationale, if a pig had a better personality, he would cease to be a filthy animal. Is that true?\nWell we'd have to be talkin' about one charming motherfuckin' pig.

Maybe if I had Lava or something, I coulda done a better job.\nI used the same fuckin' soap you did and when I got finished, the towel didn't look like no goddamn Maxi-Pad!\nOh, man, I will never forgive your ass for this shit. This is some fucked-up repugnant shit.\nJules, did you ever hear the philosophy that once a man admits that he's wrong that he is immediately forgiven for all wrongdoings?

I'm here to help - if my help's not appreciated then lotsa luck, gentlemen.\nNo, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that, your help is definitely appreciated.\nI don't mean any disrespect, I just don't like people barking orders at me.\nIf I'm curt with you it's because time is a factor.

Clean the fucking car.\nVincent, do you still want to hear my Fox Force Five joke?\nSure, but I think I'm still a little too petrified to laugh.\nNo, you wont laugh, 'cus it's not funny. But if you still wanna hear it, I'll tell it.\nI can't wait.\nThree tomatoes are walking down the street- a poppa tomato, a momma tomato, and a little baby tomato. Baby tomato starts lagging behind. Poppa tomato gets angry, goes over to the baby tomato, and smooshes him... and says, Catch up.\nWhoa!\nWhat the fuck's happening, man? Ah, shit man!\nOh man, I shot Marvin in the face.\nWhy the fuck did you do that!\nWell, I didn't mean to do it, it was an accident!\nOh man I've seen some crazy ass shit in my time...\nChill out, man. I told you it was an accident. You probably went over a bump or something.\nHey, the car didn't hit no motherfucking bump!\nHey, look man, I didn't mean to shoot the son of a bitch. The gun went off. I don't know why.\nWell look at this fucking mess, man. We're on a city street in broad daylight here!\nI don't believe it.\nWell believe it now, motherfucker! We gotta get this car off the road!

He lives in Toluca Lake.\nWhere's Toluca Lake?\nIt's just over the hill here over by Burbank Studios. If Jimmie's ass ain't home, I don't know what the fuck we're going to do, man. 'Cause I ain't got no other partners in 8-1-8.\nHey Jimmie, yo! How you doin', man? It's Jules. Listen up man. Me and my homeboy are in serious fucking shit. We're in a car and we gotta get off the road, pronto. I need to use your garage for a couple of hours.\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go home and have a heart attack.\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... stop right there. Eatin' a bitch out, and givin' a bitch a foot massage ain't even the same fuckin' thing.\nIt's not. It's the same ballpark.\nAin't no fuckin' ballpark neither. Now look, maybe your method of massage differs from mine, but, you know, touchin' his wife's feet, and stickin' your tongue in her Holiest of Holies, ain't the same fuckin' ballpark, it ain't the same league, it ain't even the same fuckin' sport. Look, foot massages don't mean shit.\nHave you ever given a foot massage?\nDon't be tellin' me about foot massages. I'm the foot fuckin' master.\nGiven a lot of 'em?\nShit yeah. I got my technique down and everything, I don't be ticklin' or nothin'.\nWould you give a guy a foot massage?\nFuck you.\nYou give them a lot?\nFuck you.\nYou know, I'm getting kinda tired. I could use a foot massage myself.\nMan, you best back off, I'm gittin' a little pissed here.\nHey, whattya think about Trudi? She ain't got a boyfriend. You wanna hang out, get high?\nWhich one's Trudi? The one with all the shit in her face?\nNo, that's Jody. That's my wife.\nWe should have shotguns for this kind of deal.\nHow many up there?\nThree or four.\nThat's countin' our guy?\nNot sure.\nSo that means there could be up to five guys up there?\nIt's possible.\nWe should have fuckin' shotguns.\nHey kids! How you boys doin'?\nHey, keep chillin'. You know who we are? We're associates of your business partner Marsellus Wallace. You do remember your business partner don't you? Let me take a wild guess here. You're Brett, right?\nYeah.\nI thought so. You remember your business partner Marsellus Wallace, don't you, Brett?\nYeah, yeah, I remember him.\nGood. Looks like me an Vincent caught you boys at breakfast. Sorry about that. Whatcha havin'?\nHamburgers.\nHamburgers! The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast. What kind of hamburgers?\nCh-cheeseburgers.\nNo, no no, where'd you get 'em? McDonalds? Wendy's? Jack in the Box? Where?\nBig Kahuna Burger.\nBig Kahuna Burger. That's that Hawaiian burger joint. I hear they got some tasty burgers. I ain't never had one myself. How are they?\nThey're good.\nMind if I try one of yours? This is yours here, right?\nMmm-mmmm. That is a tasty burger. Vincent, ever have a Big Kahuna Burger?\nWanna bite? They're real tasty.\nAin't hungry.\nWell, if you like burgers give 'em a try sometime. I can't usually get 'em myself because my girlfriend's a vegitarian which pretty much makes me a vegitarian. But I do love the taste of a good burger. Mm-mm-mm. You know what they call a Quarter Pounder with cheese in France?\nNo.\nTell 'em, Vincent.\nA Royale with cheese.\nA Royale with cheese! You know why they call it that?\nBecause of the metric system?\nCheck out the big brain on Brett! You're a smart motherfucker. That's right. The metric system. What's in this?\nSprite.\nSprite, good. You mind if I have some of your tasty beverage to wash this down?\nGo right ahead.\nAh, hit the spot.\nYou're going to give her an injection of adrenaline directly to her heart. But she's got, uh, breastplate...\nSo you gotta pierce through that. So what you have to do is, you have to bring the needle down in a stabbing motion.\nI-I gotta stab her three times?\nNo, you don't gotta fucking stab her three times! You gotta stab her once, but it's gotta be hard enough to break through her breastplate into her heart, and then once you do that, you press down on the plunger.\nWhat happens after that?\nI'm kinda curious about that myself...\nThis was Divine Intervention! You know what \"divine intervention\" is?\nYeah, I think so. That means God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets.\nYeah, man, that's what it means. That's exactly what it means! God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets.\nI think we should be going now.\nDon't do that! Don't you fucking do that! Don't blow this shit off! What just happened was a fucking miracle!\nChill the fuck out, Jules, this shit happens.\nWrong! Wrong, this shit doesn't just happen.\nDo you wanna continue this theological discussion in the car, or at the jailhouse with the cops?\nWe should be fuckin' dead now, my friend! We just witnessed a miracle, and I want you to fucking acknowledge it!\nOkay man, it was a miracle, can we leave now?\nI think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot.\nPilot? What's a pilot?\nWell, you know the shows on TV?\nI don't watch TV.\nYeah, but, you are aware that there's an invention called television, and on this invention they show shows, right?\nYeah.\nWell, the way they pick TV shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that one show to the people who pick shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they want to make more shows. Some get chosen and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.\nYou know what they put on French fries in Holland instead of ketchup?\nWhat?\nMayonnaise.\nGoddamn.\nI've seen 'em do it, man. They fuckin' drown 'em in that shit.\nLook, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'?\nI ain't saying it's right. But you're saying a foot massage don't mean nothing, and I'm saying it does. Now look, I've given a million ladies a million foot massages, and they all meant something. We act like they don't, but they do, and that's what's so fucking cool about them. There's a sensuous thing going on where you don't talk about it, but you know it, she knows it, fucking Marsellus knew it, and Antwone should have fucking better known better. I mean, that's his fucking wife, man. He can't be expected to have a sense of humor about that shit. You know what I'm saying?\nThat's an interesting point. Come on, let's get into character.\nHello.\nLance! It's Vincent. I'm in big fuckin' trouble, man. I'm coming to your house.\nWhoa. Whoa. Hold your horses, man. What's the problem?\nI've got this chick, she fuckin' O.D.in' on me!\nWell, don't bring her here! I'm not even fuckin' joking with you, man! Do not be bringing some fucked-up pooh-bah to my house!\nNo choice.\nShe's O.D.in'?\nShe's fuckin' dyin' on me, man!\nOkay, then you bite the fuckin' bullet, take her to a hospital and call a lawyer.\nNegative.\nThis is not my fuckin' problem, man! You fucked her up, you fuckin' deal with this!\nStrip.\nAll the way?\nTo your bare ass.\nIs this necessary?\nYes. You know what you guys look like?\nWhat?\nLike a couple of guys who just blew off somebody's head!\nNow Jimmie, hand them the soap.\nWell, now I'm sure you've all been to county.\nYou lookin at something, friend?\nYou ain't my friend, Palooka.\nWhat's that?\nI think you heard me just fine, Punchy.\nLook, do you wanna play blindman? Go walk with the shepherd. But me, my eyes are wide fucking open.\nWhat the fuck does that mean?\nIt means, that's it for me. From here on in you can consider my ass retired.\nJesus Christ.\nDon't blaspheme.\nGoddamn.\nI said don't do that!\nJules, if you give that fuckin' nimrod fifteen hundred dollars, I'm gonna shoot him on general principles.\nYou remember Antoine Roccamora, half black, half Samoan, used to call him Tony Rocky Horror?\nYeah, maybe. Fat, right?\nI wouldn't go so far as to call the brother fat, I mean he got a weight problem. What's the nigger gonna do?

I'm gonna sit across from her, chew my food with my mouth closed, laugh at her fucking jokes, and that's it.\nWhy the fuck didn't you tell us somebody was in the bathroom? Slipped your mind? Did you forget that somebody was in there with a goddamn hand cannon?\nThat's the Marilyn Monroe section that's Mamie Van Doren... I don't see Jayne Mansfield, she must have the night off or something.\nWhat the fuck is this place?\nThis is \"Jack Rabbit Slim's\". An Elvis man should love it.\nCome on, Mia. Let's go and get a steak.\nYou can get a steak here daddy-o. Don't be a...\nOh after you, Kitty Kat.\nHere, I'll tell you what to do.\nNo no no no man, man I ain't giving her... You... you, you're gonna give her the shot...\nNo, you're gonna give her the shot...\nI ain't givin' her the shot...\nWell, I ain't givin' her the shot!\nI never done this before!\nYeah, I ain't ever done it before either, alright? I ain't starting now! Look, you brought her here, and that means that you're giving her the shot. The day that I bring an OD-ing bitch over to your house, then I give her the shot. Give her the shot.\nGive it to me.\nHere.\nGimme that.\nStill got your Malibu?\nAw, man. You know what some fucker did the other day?\nWhat?\nFucking keyed it.\nOh, man, that's fucked up.\nTell me about it. I had it in storage for three years, it was out for five days and some dickless piece of shit fucked with it.\nThey should be fucking killed. No trial, no jury, straight to execution.\nBoy, I wish I could've caught him doing it. I'd have given anything to catch that asshole doing it. It'd been worth him doing it just so I could've caught him doing it.\nWhat a fucker!\nWhat's more chickenshit than fucking with a man's automobile? I mean, don't fuck with another man's vehicle.\nYou don't do it.\nIt's just against the rules.\nMaybe I can give you guys a ride. Where do you live?\nRedondo Beach.\nInglewood.\nIn your future... I see a cab ride. Move out of the sticks, gentlemen.\nI think we should be leaving now.\nYeah, that's probably a good idea.\nSo, tell me again about the hashbars?\nOkay, what you wanna know?\nHash is legal there in Amsterdam, right?\nYeah, it's legal, but it ain't a hundred percent legal. I mean, you can't just walk into a restaurant, roll a joint and start puffing away. You're only supposed to smoke in your home or certain designated places.\nAnd those are hashbars?\nYeah. It breaks down like this: it's legal to buy it, it's legal to own it, and, if you're the proprietor of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it. It's still illegal to carry it around, but that doesn't really matter 'cause... get a load of this: if you get stopped by the cops in Amsterdam, it's illegal for them to search you. I mean, that's a right the cops in Amsterdam don't have.\nI'm going, that's all there is to it, I'm fuckin' going.\nYeah baby, you'd dig it the most.\nHurry up, Lance! We're losing her!\nI'm lookin' as fast as I can!\nWhat's he looking for?\nI dunno. Some book.\nWhat're you looking for?\nA little black medical book!\nWhat're you looking for?\nA little black fuckin' medical book! It's like a textbook they give to nurses.\nI never saw no medical book.\nTrust me, I have one.\nWell, if it's so important, why don't you keep it with the shot?\nI DON'T KNOW! STOP BOTHERING ME!\nListen, while you're looking for it, that girl's gonna die on our carpet! You're never gonna find anything in this mess!\nI'm gonna fuckin' kill you IF YOU DON'T SHUT UP!\nSTOP ARGUING AND GET IN HERE!\nYou know how they use that gun to pierce your ears? They don't use that when they pierce your nipples, do they?\nForget that gun. That gun goes against the entire idea behind piercing. All of my piercings, sixteen places on my body, all of them done with a needle. Five in each ear, one through the nipple on my left breast, one through my right nostril, one through my left eyebrow, one in my lip, one in my clit... and I wear a stud in my tongue.\nExcuse me, but I was just wondering... why do you wear a stud in your tongue?\nIt's a sex thing. It helps fellatio.\nDon Vincenzo. Step into my office?\nDon't you just love it when you come back from the bathroom and find your food waiting for you?\nWe're lucky we got anything at all. I don't think Buddy Holly's much of a waiter.\nI don't know why, I just thought he'd be European or something because he...\nYeah, man, he's about as European as fuckin' English Bob.\nThat's a pretty fucking good milkshake. I don't know if it's worth five dollars but it's pretty fucking good.\nYou are not bringing this fucked-up bitch into my house!\nThis fucked-up bitch is Marsellus Wallace's wife! Do you know who Marsellus Wallace is? Do you? If she croaks on me, I'm a fuckin' greasespot!\nNow boys, listen up. We're going to a place called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow. I'll drive the tainted car. Jules, you ride with me. Vincent, you follow in my Acura. We run across the path of any John Q. Laws, nobody does a fucking thing unless I do it first. What did I just say?\nDon't do shit unless.\nUnless what?\nUnless you do it first.\nSpoken like a true prodigy. How about you, Lash LaRue? You think you can keep your spurs from jinglin' and janglin'?\nLook, Mr. Wolf, my gun went off, I don't know why, and now you're helping us out of the situation. I'm cool with it, all right?\nFair enough. Now I drive real fucking fast, so keep up. I get my car back any differently than when I gave it, Monster Joe's gonna be disposing of two bodies.\nYou know the shows on TV?\nI don't watch TV.\nYeah, but, you are aware that there's an invention called television, and on this invention they show shows, right?\nI'll just walk the earth.\nWhat'cha mean walk the earth?\nYou know, walk the earth, meet people... get into adventures. Like Caine from \"Kung Fu.\"\nI'll have the Douglas Sirk steak, and a vanilla Coke.\nHow would you like that? Burnt to a crisp or bloody as hell?\nBloody as hell.\nI promise I won't laugh.\nThat's what I'm afraid of, Vincent.\nWho's she?\nLook, go to the fridge and get the thing with the O.D. adrenalin shot.\nWhat's wrong with her?\nShe's O.D.ing!\nGet her the hell outta her!\n, :\nGET THE SHOT!\n, :\nGET THE SHOT!\nFuck you! Fuck you, too!\nWhat a fuckin' bitch!\nYou just keep talking to her, all right? She's getting the shot, I'm gonna get my little black medical book.\nWhat the fuck do you need a medical book for?\nI've never had to give an adrenalin shot.\nYou never give an adrenalin shot?\nI've never had to, all right! I don't go joy-poppin' with bubble-gummers! My friends can handle their highs!\nGET THE SHOT!\nOh, fuck! I'm fucked. Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!\nIs he a friend of yours?\nHmm? Oh, Vincent, Marvin. Marvin, Vincent.\nBetter tell him to shut the fuck up. He's gettin' on my nerves!\nMarvin? Marvin... MARVIN!\nI'd knock that shit off if I was you.\nThank you. Mind if I shoot it up here?\nHey, mi casa su casa.\nRemember, I just got back from Amsterdam.\nAm I a nigger? Are we in Inglewood? No... You're in my home. White people who know the difference between good shit and bad shit, this is the house they come to. Now, my shit, I'll take the Pepsi challenge with that Amsterdam shit, any day of the fuckin' week.\nThat's a bold statement.\nThis ain't Amsterdam, Vince. This is a sellers market. Coke is fucking dead as... dead. Heroin, it's coming back in a big fucking way.\nIf you'll excuse me, I gotta go home and have a heart attack.\nIn conversation, do you listen or wait to talk?\nI have to admit that I wait to talk, but I'm trying harder to listen.\nGet her the shot!\nI will if you let me.\nI ain't fuckin' stopping you!\nWell, then quit talking to me, talk to her.\nGet the shot!\nOh, Jesus Christ. Oh, fuck me! Fuck me!\nGo home, cool off, and that's all you got to do. \n\nGiven quotes from the character above, which of the following tropes would you say this character represents?\n\nA: Absent Minded Professor\nB: Adventurer Archaeologist\nC: Arrogant Kungfu Guy\nD: Big Man On Campus\nE: Bounty Hunter\nF: Brainless Beauty\nG: Broken Bird\nH: Bromantic Foil\nI: Bruiser With A Soft Center\nJ: Bully\nK: Byronic Hero\nL: Casanova\nM: Chanteuse\nN: Charmer\nO: Child Prodigy\nP: Classy Cat Burglar\nQ: Consummate Professional\nR: Corrupt Corporate Executive\nS: Coward\nT: Crazy Jealous Guy\nU: Crazy Survivalist\nV: Cultured Badass\nW: Dean Bitterman\nX: Dirty Cop\nY: Ditz\nZ: Doormat\nAA: Drill Sargeant Nasty\nAB: Dumb Blonde\nAC: Dumb Muscle\nAD: Eccentric Mentor\nAE: Egomaniac Hunter\nAF: Evil Prince\nAG: Fastest Gun In The West\nAH: Father To His Men\nAI: Final Girl\nAJ: Gadgeteer Genius\nAK: Gentleman Thief\nAL: Granola Person\nAM: Grumpy Old Man\nAN: Hardboiled Detective\nAO: Heartbroken Badass\nAP: Henpecked Husband\nAQ: Hitman With A Heart\nAR: Jerk Jock\nAS: Junkie Prophet\nAT: Klutz\nAU: Loser Protagonist\nAV: Loveable Rogue\nAW: Master Swordsman\nAX: Morally Bankrupt Banker\nAY: Officer And A Gentleman\nAZ: Ophelia\nBA: Playful Hacker\nBB: Prima Donna\nBC: Psycho For Hire\nBD: Pupil Turned To Evil\nBE: Retired Outlaw\nBF: Revenge\nBG: Romantic Runnerup\nBH: Self Made Man\nBI: Slacker\nBJ: Stoner\nBK: Storyteller\nBL: Stupid Crooks\nBM: Surfer Dude\nBN: The Chief\nBO: The Editor\nBP: Tranquil Fury\nBQ: Trickster\nBR: Valley Girl\nBS: Warrior Poet\nBT: Young Gun\n",

Give me some water!\nListen, you can run water over your hand and make it worse or...\nLook at me... or you can use vinegar and neutralize the burn.\nPlease let me have it... *Please*!\nFirst you have to give up, first you have to *know*... not fear... *know*... that someday you're gonna die.\nSticking feathers up your butt does not make you a chicken.\nWe're a generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need.\nThe first soap was made from heroes' ashes, like the first monkey shot into space.Without pain, without sacrifice, we would have nothing. Like the first monkey shot into space.\nIt could be worse. A woman could cut off your penis while you're sleeping and toss it out the window of a moving car.\nThere's always that.\nI am Jack's colon.\nI get cancer, I kill Jack.\nTyler, what the fuck is going on here?\nI ask you for one thing, one simple thing.\nWhy do people think that I'm you? Answer me!\nSit.\nNow answer me, why do people think that I'm you.\nI think you know.\nNo, I don't.\nYes, you do. Why would anyone possibly confuse you with me?\nUh... I... I don't know.\nYou got it.\nNo.\nSay it.\nBecause...\nSay it.\nBecause we're the same person.\nThat's right.\nOh, it's late. Hey, thanks for the beer.\nYeah, man.\nI should find a hotel.\nWhat?\nWhat?\nA hotel?\nYeah.\nJust ask, man.\nWhat are you talking about?\nThree pitchers of beer, and you still can't ask.\nWhat?\nYou call me because you need a place to stay.\nOh, hey, no, no, no, I didn't mean...\nYes, you did. So just ask. Cut the foreplay and just ask.\nWould - would that be a problem?\nIs it a problem for you to ask?\nCan I stay at your place?\nYeah.\nWHOA! WHOA! WHOA! Ok, you are now firing a gun at your 'imaginary friend' near 400 GALLONS OF NITROGLYCERINE!\nShut up! Our fathers were our models for God. If our fathers bailed, what does that tell you about God?\nNo, no, I... don't...\nListen to me! You have to consider the possibility that God does not like you. He never wanted you. In all probability, he hates you. This is not the worst thing that can happen.\nIt isn't?\nWe don't need him!\nDo you know what a duvet is?\nIt's a comforter...\nIt's a blanket. Just a blanket. Now why do guys like you and me know what a duvet is? Is this essential to our survival, in the hunter-gatherer sense of the word? No. What are we then?\n...Consumers?\nRight. We are consumers. We're the by-products of a lifestyle obsession.\nBob is dead, they shot him in the head!\nYou wanna make an omelet, you gotta break some eggs.\nFuck off with your sofa units and strine green stripe patterns, I say never be complete, I say stop being perfect, I say let... lets evolve, let the chips fall where they may.\nTomorrow will be the most beautiful day of Raymond K. Hessel's life. His breakfast will taste better than any meal you and I have ever tasted.\nWhere'd you go, psycho boy?\nI felt like destroying something beautiful.\nThis is crazy...\nPeople do it everyday, they talk to themselves... they see themselves as they'd like to be, they don't have the courage you have, to just run with it.\nWhat do you do for a living?\nWhy? So you can pretend like you're interested?\nThis isn't love, it's sport fucking.\nDo you hear me now?\nNo, I didn't quite catch that, Lou.\nStill not getting it.\nOkay, I got it. Shit, I lost it.\nMy dad never went to college, so it was real important that I go.\nSounds familiar.\nSo I graduate, I call him up long distance, I say \"Dad, now what?\" He says, \"Get a job.\"\nSame here.\nNow I'm 25, make my yearly call again. I say Dad, \"Now what?\" He says, \"I don't know, get married.\"\nI can't get married, I'm a 30 year old boy.\nWe're a generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need.\nWhat are you doing?\nGuys, what would you wish you'd done before you died?\nPaint a self-portrait.\nBuild a house.\nAnd you?\nI don't know. Turn the wheel now, come on!\nYou have to know the answer to this question! If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?\nI don't know, I wouldn't feel anything good about my life, is that what you want to hear me say? Fine. Come on!\nNot good enough.\nHitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat. It's not a goddamn seminar. Stop trying to control everything and just let go! LET GO!\nYou don't know which wire to pull.\nI know everything you do, so if you know I know.\nOr maybe, since I knew you'd know I spent all days thinking about the wrong wires.\nHi. You're going to call off your rigorous investigation. You're going to publicly state that there is no underground group. Or... these guys are going to take your balls. They're going to send one to the New York Times, one to the LA Times press-release style. Look, the people you are after are the people you depend on. We cook your meals, we haul your trash, we connect your calls, we drive your ambulances. We guard you while you sleep. Do not... fuck with us.\nTyler, I'm grateful to you; for everything that you've done for me. But this is too much. I don't want this.\nWhat do you want? Wanna go back to the shit job, fuckin' condo world, watching sitcoms? Fuck you, I won't do it.\nSelf improvement is masturbation. Now self destruction...\nIn the world I see - you are stalking elk through the damp canyon forests around the ruins of Rockefeller Center. You'll wear leather clothes that will last you the rest of your life. You'll climb the wrist-thick kudzu vines that wrap the Sears Tower. And when you look down, you'll see tiny figures pounding corn, laying strips of venison on the empty car pool lane of some abandoned superhighway.\nI look around, I look around, I see a lot of new faces.\nShut up. Which means a lot of you have been breaking the first two rules of Fight Club.\nFuck what you know. You need to forget about what you know, that's your problem. Forget about what you think you know about life, about friendship, and especially about you and me.\nYou have a kind of sick desperation in your laugh.\nOK: any historic figure.\nI'd fight Gandhi.\nGood answer.\nHow about you?\nLincoln.\nLincoln?\nBig guy, big reach. Skinny guys fight 'til they're burger.\nI'll bring us through this. As always. I'll carry you - kicking and screaming - and in the end you'll thank me.\nReject the basic assumptions of civilization, especially the importance of material possessions.\nAll the ways you wish you could be, that's me. I look like you wanna look, I fuck like you wanna fuck, I am smart, capable, and most importantly, I am free in all the ways that you are not.\nThis is your pain. This is your burning hand. It's right here. Look at it.\nI'm going to my cave. I'm going to my cave and I'm going to find my power animal.\nNo! Don't deal with this the way those dead people do. Deal with it the way a living person does.\nPeople are always asking me if I know Tyler Durden.\nThree minutes. This is it - ground zero. Would you like to say a few words to mark the occasion?\n...i... ann... iinn... ff... nnyin...\nWith a gun barrel between your teeth, you speak only in vowels.\nI can't think of anything.\nFor a second I totally forgot about Tyler's whole controlled demolition thing and I wonder how clean that gun is.\nWe're consumers. We are by-products of a lifestyle obsession. Murder, crime, poverty, these things don't concern me. What concerns me are celebrity magazines, television with 500 channels, some guy's name on my underwear. Rogaine, Viagra, Olestra.\nMartha Stewart.\nFuck Martha Stewart. Martha's polishing the brass on the Titanic. It's all going down, man. So fuck off with your sofa units and Strinne green stripe patterns.\nTyler was a night person. While the rest of us were sleeping, he worked. He had one part time job as a projectionist. See, a movie doesn't come all on one big reel. It comes on a few. So someone has to be there to switch the projectors at the exact moment that one reel ends and the next one begins. If you look for it, you can see these little dots come into the upper right-hand corner of the screen.\nIn the industry, we call them \"cigarette burns.\"\nThat's the cue for a changeover. He flips the projectors, the movie keeps right on going, and nobody in the audience has any idea.\nWhy would anyone want this shit job?\nBecause it affords him other interesting opportunities.\nLike splicing single frames of pornography into family films.\nYou're insane.\nNo, you're insane.\nDid you know that if you mix equal parts of gasoline and frozen orange juice concentrate you can make napalm?\nNo, I did not know that; is that true?\nThat's right... One could make all kinds of explosives, using simple household items.\nReally...?\nIf one were so inclined.\nTyler, you are by far the most interesting single-serving friend I've ever met... see I have this thing: everything on a plane is single-serving...\nOh I get it, it's very clever.\nThank you.\nHow's that working out for you?\nWhat?\nBeing clever.\nGreat.\nKeep it up then... Right up.\nNow a question of etiquette; as I pass, do I give you the ass or the crotch...?\nFight Club was the beginning, now it's moved out of the basement, it's called Project Mayhem.\nWe are all part of the same compost heap.\nNow, ancient people found their clothes got cleaner if they washed them at a certain spot in the river. You know why?\nNo.\nHuman sacrifices were once made on the hills above this river. Bodies burnt, water speeded through the wood ashes to create lye.\nThis is lye - the crucial ingredient. The lye combined with the melted fat of the bodies, till a thick white soapy discharge crept into the river. May I see your hand, please?\nWhat is this?\nThis...\n... is chemical burn.\nAll right, if the applicant is young, tell him he's too young. Old, too old. Fat, too fat. If the applicant then waits for three days without food, shelter, or encouragement he may then enter and begin his training.\nGod Damn! We just had a near-life experience, fellas.\nWould you like to say a few words to mark the occasion?\nmumbles...\nI'm sorry...\nI still can't think of anything.\nAh... flashback humor.\nIs that what a man looks like?\nSelf-improvement is masturbation. Now self-destruction...\nYou don't know where I've been. You don't know where I've been. Just let us have the basement, Lou!\nTell him. Tell him, The liberator who destroyed my property has realigned my perceptions.\nShe's a predator posing as a house pet.\nNow why would you want to go and blow your head off?\nNot my head, Tyler, *our* head.\nThe salt balance has to be just right, so the best fat for making soap comes from humans.\nWait. What is this place?\nA liposuction clinic.\nYou're fucking Marla, Tyler.\nUh, technically, you're fucking Marla, but it's all the same to her.\nIf you could fight anyone, who would you fight?\nI'd fight my boss, prob'ly.\nReally.\nYeah, why, who would you fight?\nI'd fight my dad.\nI don't know my dad. I mean, I know him, but... he left when I was like six years old. Married this other woman, had some other kids. He like did this every six years, he goes to a new city and starts a new family.\nFucker's setting up franchises.\nI had it all. I had a stereo that was very decent, a wardrobe that was getting very respectable. I was close to being complete.\nShit man, now it's all gone.\nWhat do you do?\nWhat do you mean?\nWhat do you do for a living?\nWhy? So you can pretend like you're interested?\nI want you to listen to me very carefully, Tyler.\nOkay...\nMy eyes are open.\nI want you to hit me as hard as you can.\nWhat do you want me to do? You want me to hit you?\nCome on, do me this one favor.\nWhy?\nWhy? I don't know why, I don't know. Never been in a fight, you?\nNo, but that's a good thing.\nNo, man it's not. How much can you know yourself if you've never been in a fight? I don't wanna die with out any scars.\n*slaps the Narrator, throws away goggles* Listen to me! You have to consider the possibility that God does not like you, never wanted you, and in all probability, he HATES you. It's not the worst thing that can happen.\nIt isn't?\nWe don't NEED Him!\n*squirms* We don't - we don't - !\nFuck damnation, man! Fuck redemption! We're God's unwanted children, SO BE IT!\nYou're too old, fat man. Your tits are too big.\nGet the fuck off my porch.\nWhat are we doing tonight?\nTonight? We make soap.\nReally.\nTo make soap, first we render fat.\nWHOA! WHOA! OK, you are now firing a gun at your imaginary friend NEAR 400 GALLONS OF NITROGLYCERIN!\nLike a monkey, ready to be shot into space. Space monkey! Ready to sacrifice himself for the greater good.\nFrom now on, all those with shaved heads: \"Space Monkeys\".\nSo when the snooty cat, and the courageous dog, with the celebrity voices meet for the first time in reel three, that's when you'll catch a flash of Tyler's contribution to the film.\nNobody knows that they saw it, but they did...\nA nice, big cock...\nEven a hummingbird couldn't catch Tyler at work.\nThe richest, creamiest fat in the world. The fat of the land.\n...If you don't claim your humanity you will become a statistic. You have been warned\nIt's getting exciting now, two and one-half. Think of everything we've accomplished, man. Out these windows, we will view the collapse of financial history. One step closer to economic equilibrium.\nFuck.\nHey, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart.\nHello?\nWho is this?\nTyler?\nWho is this?\nUh... we met... we met on the airplane. We had the same suitcase. Uh... the clever guy?\nOh yeah, right.\nOk?\nI called a second ago, th - there was no answer, I'm at the payphone...\nyeah, I *69ed you, I never pick up my phone.\nSo what's up, huh?\nUh, well... You're not gonna believe this...\nJust tell him you fuckin' did it. Tell him you blew it all up. That's what he wants to hear.\nWhat's that smell?\nSomething on your mind, dear?\nMan, you've got some fucked up friends, I'm tellin' ya. Limber, though...\nWhy wasn't I told about Project Mayhem?\nWhat are you talking about?\nWhy didn't you include me, in the beginning?\nFight Club *was* the beginning.\nIf you could fight any celebrity, who would you fight?\nAlive or dead?\nDoesn't matter. Who'd be tough?\nHemingway. You?\nShatner. I'd fight William Shatner.\n*punches Tyler in face* You here me now?\nAlright, alright, I got it. I got it - shit I lost it.\nNo, you have a house.\nRented in your name.\nYou have jobs! You have a whole life!\nYou have night jobs because you can't sleep. Why do you stay up and make soap?\nMarla. You're fucking Marla, Tyler.\nAh technically *you're* fucking Marla, but it's all the same to her.\nOh my God.\nWell you did lose a lot of versatile solutions for modern living\nThis is a chemical burn. It will hurt more than you've ever been burned before. You will have a scar.\nHe was *the* guerilla terrorist in the food service industry.\nDo not watch. I cannot go when you watch.\nApart from seasoning the lobster bisque, he farted on the meringue, sneezed on braised endive, and as for the cream of mushroom soup, well...\nGo ahead. Tell 'em.\n...you get the idea. \n\nGiven quotes from the character above, which of the following tropes would you say this character represents?\n\nA: Absent Minded Professor\nB: Adventurer Archaeologist\nC: Arrogant Kungfu Guy\nD: Big Man On Campus\nE: Bounty Hunter\nF: Brainless Beauty\nG: Broken Bird\nH: Bromantic Foil\nI: Bruiser With A Soft Center\nJ: Bully\nK: Byronic Hero\nL: Casanova\nM: Chanteuse\nN: Charmer\nO: Child Prodigy\nP: Classy Cat Burglar\nQ: Consummate Professional\nR: Corrupt Corporate Executive\nS: Coward\nT: Crazy Jealous Guy\nU: Crazy Survivalist\nV: Cultured Badass\nW: Dean Bitterman\nX: Dirty Cop\nY: Ditz\nZ: Doormat\nAA: Drill Sargeant Nasty\nAB: Dumb Blonde\nAC: Dumb Muscle\nAD: Eccentric Mentor\nAE: Egomaniac Hunter\nAF: Evil Prince\nAG: Fastest Gun In The West\nAH: Father To His Men\nAI: Final Girl\nAJ: Gadgeteer Genius\nAK: Gentleman Thief\nAL: Granola Person\nAM: Grumpy Old Man\nAN: Hardboiled Detective\nAO: Heartbroken Badass\nAP: Henpecked Husband\nAQ: Hitman With A Heart\nAR: Jerk Jock\nAS: Junkie Prophet\nAT: Klutz\nAU: Loser Protagonist\nAV: Loveable Rogue\nAW: Master Swordsman\nAX: Morally Bankrupt Banker\nAY: Officer And A Gentleman\nAZ: Ophelia\nBA: Playful Hacker\nBB: Prima Donna\nBC: Psycho For Hire\nBD: Pupil Turned To Evil\nBE: Retired Outlaw\nBF: Revenge\nBG: Romantic Runnerup\nBH: Self Made Man\nBI: Slacker\nBJ: Stoner\nBK: Storyteller\nBL: Stupid Crooks\nBM: Surfer Dude\nBN: The Chief\nBO: The Editor\nBP: Tranquil Fury\nBQ: Trickster\nBR: Valley Girl\nBS: Warrior Poet\nBT: Young Gun\n",

    "69": "We train young men to drop fire on people, but their commanders won't allow them to write \"fuck\" on their airplanes because it's obscene!\nThe horror... the horror...\nI've seen horrors... horrors that you've seen. But you have no right to call me a murderer. You have a right to kill me. You have a right to do that... but you have no right to judge me. It's impossible for words to describe what is necessary to those who do not know what horror means. Horror... Horror has a face... and you must make a friend of horror. Horror and moral terror are your friends. If they are not, then they are enemies to be feared. They are truly enemies! I remember when I was with Special Forces... seems a thousand centuries ago. We went into a camp to inoculate some children. We left the camp after we had inoculated the children for polio, and this old man came running after us and he was crying. He couldn't see. We went back there, and they had come and hacked off every inoculated arm. There they were in a pile. A pile of little arms. And I remember... I... I... I cried, I wept like some grandmother. I wanted to tear my teeth out; I didn't know what I wanted to do! And I want to remember it. I never want to forget it... I never want to forget. And then I realized... like I was shot... like I was shot with a diamond... a diamond bullet right through my forehead. And I thought, my God... the genius of that! The genius! The will to do that! Perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline, pure. And then I realized they were stronger than we, because they could stand that these were not monsters, these were men... trained cadres. These men who fought with their hearts, who had families, who had children, who were filled with love... but they had the strength... the strength... to do that. If I had ten divisions of those men, our troubles here would be over very quickly. You have to have men who are moral... and at the same time who are able to utilize their primordial instincts to kill without feeling... without passion... without judgment... without judgment! Because it's judgment that defeats us.\nI watched a snail crawl along the edge of a straight razor. That's my dream; that's my nightmare. Crawling, slithering, along the edge of a straight razor... and surviving.\nDid they say why, Willard, why they want to terminate my command?\nI was sent on a classified mission, sir.\nIt's no longer classified, is it? Did they tell you?\nThey told me that you had gone totally insane, and that your methods were unsound.\nAre my methods unsound?\nI don't see any method at all, sir.\nI expected someone like you. What did you expect? Are you an assassin?\nI'm a soldier.\nYou're neither. You're an errand boy, sent by grocery clerks, to collect a bill.\nThey train young men to drop fire on people. But their commanders won't allow them to write 'fuck' on their airplanes because it is obscene.\nHave you ever considered any real freedoms? Freedoms from the opinion of others... even the opinions of yourself?\nI worry that my son might not understand what I've tried to be. And if I were to be killed, Willard, I would want someone to go to my home and tell my son everything. Everything I did, everything you saw, because there's nothing that I detest more than the stench of lies. And if you understand me, Willard, you will do this for me.\nWe must kill them. We must incinerate them. Pig after pig... cow after cow... village after village... army after army...\nWhat do you call it when the assassins accuse the assassin? A lie. A lie and we have to be merciful.\nWhere are you from, Willard?\nI'm from Ohio, sir.\nWere you born there?\nYes, sir.\nWhereabouts?\nToledo, sir.\nHow far are you from the river?\nThe Ohio River, sir?\nUh-huh.\nAbout 200 miles.\nI went down that river once when I was a kid. There's a place in that river - I can't remember - must have been a gardenia plantation at one time. It's all wild and overgrown now, but about five miles, you'd think that heaven just fell on the earth in the form of gardenias. Have you considered any real freedoms?

His pickle was small enough to stay wedged after only four bites.\nI'll bet you're the only guy in the world who still remembers that, Graves.\nOh, I bet you still remember it pretty vividly, Pickle Fucker.\nWhat the fuck?\nPORCH MONKEY?\nOh, no no, it's cool, I'm taking it back.\nIt must be nice to have a job with so much downtime.\nDowntime's important. If I had to deal with all the fucking mouthbreathers non-stop without a break, I'd put my head in the deep-fryer.\nBalls, too...\nFuck, I had to take a fuckin' order off a guy I blew after Junior Prom, once.\nYeah, I've waited on your brother, too.\nYou wouldn't wanna be with a girl with an oversized clit?\nNo, 'cause the next step is a guy with an undersized dick.\nMan, you must love this fucking guy, 'cause he's the biggest pussy I ever met, the dude who lives his life according to everyone else's standards. \"I have to go down to Florida and get married because that what's expected of me.\" And the fucking insane part is, he ain't even crazy about the chick he's marrying or Florida, never mind the fact that he's got a perfectly good chick right here in Jersey who he's nuts about, and even Anne fucking Frank could see she's nuts about him too. And she likes you for who you are, man. She ain't trying to stuff you into a box you'll never fit into, not to mention that she's carrying your hideous fucking chud of a kid. Jesus, if you had any sense whatsoever, you'd fucking stop trying to bray it up with the rest of the sheep and live your life the way it makes sense to you, you fucking ass.\nTerrorists?\nI left the coffee pot on again, didn't I?\nShit! Now where am I gonna bring chicks to fuck when my mom's home?\nYou fuckin' freak.\nI'm not even gonna point out the irony, here.\nHere's the first movie.\nAnd here's the second movie.\nHe is way off, loser.\nYou ready for the third movie?\nJail cell design hasn't changed much in centuries, has it? Maybe it's time they brought in the laser bars, or something.\nOh, they can make a hard plastic cage like Magneto's in X-Men 2! Nauw.\nCome on, dude, let's keep it in the real world, alright? But you know what wouldn't be a bad idea? Carbonite. What do you think, Dante?\nI think I'm gonna kill you!\nWhat up, steel cage match!\nYou ruined my life!\nYour life was already ruined, get off of me!\nWhat were you thinking? A fuckin' Donkey show?\nIt was your going away present!\nSure was! I just never thought I'd be going away to prison!\nBoys? You can't be imprisoned for watching an inter-species sex act. You'll walk. The worst I'll get is a huge fine for animal abuse, and alot of disgusted looks from ass-wipe conservatives who can't appreciate sexual exploration.\nI miss my donkey.\nI can't believe you.\nI finally get my shit together, I'm hours away from getting out of here, and you somehow manage to obliterate all that and reduce me to a convict!\nOh yeah, it's my fault that your life's so fucked up! I'm the engaged guy who knocked up my boss!\nYou knocked up the guy that owns Mooby's? Sick!\nWould you just shut up?\nChicks dig Lord of the Rings, Randal.\nShyeah, the kind of chicks into swords and elves and shit, and I wouldn't fuck them with the Torch of Gondor.\nOh, you're so gross!\nWhy *do* the Go-Karts help?\nI don't know. They just remind me of a better time in my life.\nLike when?\nLike when we were young and the world was still in front of us.\nWe're not that old.\nYeah. But, sometimes I get the feeling the world kinda left us behind a long time ago.\nYou know, you can do something about that.\nI told you, I don't wanna jerk off in the bathroom at work!\nI know you've given a blowjob, right?\nI haven't even put my purse down, yet.\nThat's a yes.\nAnd I know you've gone down on chicks.\nWhat's your point?\nWell, when you're done chowing down on the no-no parts of your lover you kiss 'em, right? That's just like going ass to mouth.\nOkay, I'm pretty sure you just compared a vagina to an asshole.\nAnd?\nHave you restocked all the napkin holders yet?\nThat's an Elias job!\nThat comparison of pink and brown eyes just made it a Randal job.\nZing!\nShut the fuck up, GoBot!\nI could probably sue this whole corporation right now for sexual harassment. You're just making me restock the napkin holders because of my firmly held beliefs on the subject of ass to mouth.\nYou never go ass to mouth!\nWould you grow up?\nSince when did porch monkey suddenly become a racial slur?\nWhen ignorant racists started saying it a hundred years ago!\nOh, bullshit! My grandmother used to call me a porch monkey all the time when I was a kid because I'd sit on the porch and stare at my neighbors!\nDespite the fact that your grandmother might've used it as a term of endearment for you, it's still a racial slur! It'd be like your grandmother calling you a little kike!\nOh, it is not. Plus, my grandmother had nothing but the utmost respect for the Jewish community. When I was a kid she told me to always treat the Jewish kids with the utmost respect, or they'd put the sheni curse on me.\nWhat the fuck, man?\nWhat?\nSheni's a racial slur, too!\nOh, it is not.\nYes, it is!\nShe never called any Jews 'sheni', she just used to say sheni curse a lot. It was cute!\nIt wasn't cute! It was racist!\nI disagree, man, she was just an old timer, that's the way people talked back then! Didn't mean they were racist... Although my grandmother did refer to a broken beer bottle once as a nigger knife... You know, come to think of it, my grandmother was kind of a racist.\nYou think?\nWell,I still don't think porch monkey should be considered a racial term. I mean, I've always used it to describe lazy people, not lazy black people! I think if we really tried, we could re-claim it, and save it.\nIt can't be saved, Randal! The sole purpose for its creation, the only reason it exists in the first place, is to disparage an entire race! And even if it could be saved, you can't save it because you're not black!\nWell listen to you! Telling me I can't do something because of the color of my skin! You're the racist! I'm taking it back, you watch!\nHey, what can I get for you, you little porch monkey?\nIts cool, I'm taking it back.\nHey man.\nWelcome to Mooby's, may I take your order?\nYeah um, let's see... Give me one udderly delicious Moo-ilk shake, Skinny Calf and a, order of onion rings. Thanks.\n\"One ring to rule them all.\"\n\"One ring to find them.\"\nOh Jesus.\n\"One ring to bring them all.\"\n\"And in the darkness bind them!\"\nYes! How many times?\nUmm, three for 'Fellowship', two for 'Towers', *four* for 'Return'.\nFive for return.\nDude.\nOkay, look. There's only one 'Return', okay, and it ain't of 'The King', it's of 'The Jedi'.\nOh, Star Wars geek.\nOh I'm the geek? Look at you two whipping out your preciouses.\nYou'll have to excuse him. He's not 'down' with the trilogy.\nOh, what the fuck happened to this world? There's only one trilogy you fucking morons.\nYou know what, maybe we should start calling your friend Padme, because he loves Mannequin Skywalker so much, right?\nDanger, danger, my name is Anakin. My shitty acting is ruining saga.\nYeah, you're crazy, Jar-Jar.\nOh I'm crazy? Those fucking hobbit movies were boring as hell. All it was was a bunch of people walking. Three movies of people walking to a fucking volcano... Here's the first movie...\n... And here's the second movie...\n...\nHe is way off. Loser.\n...You ready for the third movie?\nFuckin' A.\nWhat are you writing over there, your memoirs?\nI'm battling this jackass on his blog's message boards.\nAbout what?\nAbout how he's got too much free time and no life. A guy in a wheelchair who's always preying on other people's sympathies, writing these long diatribes about how he'll never walk again, and how walkers should appreciate the blessings of their functioning legs, so I've been getting into it with him, throwing it right back in his stupid crippie-boy face about how I love to just sit around, and how I'd rather drive to the end of the block than walk!\nThe guy's in a wheelchair.\nYeah. That's why I called him \"crippie-boy.\"\nEmma, are you like this 'cause you have an unnaturally large clit?\nYou just *had* to tell him, didn't ya?\nIt kinda came out one day!\nHe says it's so big it's almost like a little cock, which says all kinds of weird things about him that I don't even wanna think about.\nYou became persona non-nookie to me the minute he started diddling your pooter.\nSo thinking of me in terms of being a girl kind of creeps you out, does it?\nSweetheart, I don't think of you in terms of being a girl, I don't think of you in any way...\nOh, that was just *wrong*.\nIf you don't get the fuck out of here so that I can spend some quality time with my man, next I'm gonna show you my pooter.\nWhy would you wanna do something like that?\nAlright, alright, I'm leaving!\nI don't think these look right.\nJesus! Step away from the fryer before you burn us all alive!\nIt's not my fault you abandoned your post!\nWas it too much to ask that you handle the fries? The machine does all the work! What's a machine gotta transform into some giant fuckin' robot before you'll take it seriously? Go home!\nThat's bestiality, Randal!\nAt its finest, I hope.\nWho would want to see something like that?\nMe, Dante, *you*.\nI don't wanna see something like that! Why would you wanna see something like that?\nBecause it's fucked up! And, I wanna see if a chick with a mouth full of donkey spunk swallows. Alright, here we go. Kinky Kelly and the Sexy Stud. Straight from their dirty debut in Tijuana, Kelly's taking it on the road. Taking it in the ass, that is. You gotta give it up for Oscar Wilde-like wordplay that good.\nDo they show pictures?\nOnly one of Kinky Kelly sucking off Optimus Prime.\nReally?\nOw.\nLemme borrow your cell phone.\nOh... 'Cause I'm only supposed to use it to call my parents in case of an emergency.\nThis is an emergency. We gotta lock up Kinky Kelly for tonight so we can give Mr. Dante a memorable send off. You love Mr. Dante, don'tcha?\nIn a non-gay way.\nHow the fuck do you always have like two good-looking girls who want you? You're the most hideous fucking chud I've ever met, and you always have a pair of girls fighting over you.\nYou swung at me!\nYou ducked.\nBecause you swung at me!\nI can't believe you. I finally get my shit together. I'm hours from getting outta here, and really starting my life, and you somehow figure out a way to obliterate all that and reduce me to a convict.\nOh, yeah, it's my fault your life's fucked up. \"I'm the engaged guy who knocked up my boss!\"\nYou knocked up the guy who owns Mooby's?\nWhat?\nYou're my best friend, and I love you... In a totally heterosexual way.\nYeah, right.\nLadies and gentlemen, and you, Elias! Straight from the debauchery capital of the world, Tijuana Mexico!\nOh, God, no.\nOh, God, yes!\nSeventeen year olds nowadays are crazy. They're up for anything. They even like it when you go ass to mouth.\nOh, my God.\nWhat?\nAre you serious?\nI don't fuck around when it comes to ass to mouth.\nYou never go ass to mouth!\nIt's never my idea!\nWhat's the point in having an Internet connection if you're not using it to look up weird, fucked-up pictures of dirty sex you'll never have yourself?\nNo, we had sex one night after work a few weeks ago.\nWhat? Where?\nHere, on the prep station table.\nEw, that's my prep table.\nIf Peter Jackson really wanted to blow me away with those \"Rings\" movies, he would have ended the third one on the logical closure point, not the 25 endings that followed.\nEven the fuckin' trees walked in those movies.\nI'd buy the Quick Stop and reopen it myself. That's what I'd do. That's what we should do.\nAvert your eyes, ya' perv!\nNot very hygienic. That's all I'm gonna tell you.\nYou're gonna be rolling in the pussy, man!\nDon't be gross!\nSays the guy who was just playing tonsil hockey with his mother.\nThe best part of this job is all the barely legal pussy that comes in here. And they all look up to me 'cause I've got a driver's license. It's awesome.\nYou know something? You're not even supposed to be here today!\nRandal...\n\"One ring to rule them all.\"\nAnd you wonder why no chick'll let you stick your cock in her.\nI never wondered that.\nYeah, 'cause you've accepted the fact that you'll never get a chick a long time ago.\nI could get a chick if I wanted.\nWho are you kidding? You can't get a chick ya mook, you're too weird and sad.\nI turn down chicks left and right.\nYour chicks are your \"left\" and \"right.\"\nYeah right, what do you know?\nAhh, I know that you're a huge fucking nerd of Potsie-like proportions, and no chicks dig nerds. Especially nerds that are into Lord of the Rings.\nChicks dig Lord of the Rings, Randal.\nYeah. The kind of chicks that are into swords and elves and shit, and I wouldn't fuck them with the torch of Gondor.\nOh, you're so gross!\nThe best part of this job is all the barely legal pussy that comes in here. And they all look up to me 'cause I've got a driver's license. It's awesome.\nYou're thirty-three.\nYou show me one thirty-three year old chick who's buck wild in bed as your seventeen year old counterpie. Seventeen year olds nowadays are crazy. They even like it when you go ass-to-mouth.\nOh... My... God.\nWhat?\nAre you serious?\nI don't fuck around when it comes to ass-to-mouth.\nYou never go ass-to-mouth.\nIt's never my idea. These young girls, they get all horned up and they tell you to go ass-to-mouth.\nYou never go ass-to-mouth, Randal.\nYou sound like my Mom.\nBecks, do you ever go ass-to-mouth?\nYou never go ass-to-mouth.\nYou've never gone ass-to-mouth.\nYou never go ass-to-mouth.\nI've never gone ass to mouth.\nNot even once?\nNot even ever.\nYou're both so repressive.\nAlright look, I know you've given a blowjob, right?\nI haven't even put my purse down yet.\nThat's a yes.\nAnd I know you've gone down on chicks.\nWhat's your point?\nWell, when you're done chowin' down on the no-no parts of your lover, you kiss 'em, right? That's just like going ass to mouth.\nOkay, I'm pretty sure you just compared a vagina to an ass hole.\nSometimes, in the heat of the moment, it's forgivable to go ass to mouth.\nHeh. I knew it.\nSo, where're we doin' this thing?\nOh, right inside the restaurant.\nYou're kidding.\nNot spacious enough?\nNo, it's plenty spacious, just kinda weird, isn't it?\nKinda weird? You're in the bestiality business, dude.\nHey, Fucko, we like to call it inter-species erotica.\nIntriguing.\nCan you feel it?\nFeel what?\nToday is the first day of the rest of our lives.\nI made fun of \"Lord of the Rings\" so hard, it made some supergeek puke all over the counter. Where do we keep the mop and bucket so I can have Elias clean it up?\nIn the closet, with the rest of the cleaning products.\nWe have cleaning products?\nEase up, Pillow Pants. The dude's not into your D&D; GoBots bullshit.\n\"One Ring to rule them all.\"\n\"One Ring to find them.\"\nOh, Jesus.\n\"One Ring to bring them all.\"\n\"And in the darkness, bind them!\"\nAs you know, my online handle is Optimus Prime.\nI know that, I wish I didn't.\nI'm having second thoughts.\nAbout your sexuality?\nI got to rent movies, fuck with assholes, and hang out with my best friend, Dante.\nYou can't get a chick, ya mook. You're too weird and sad.\nI turn down chicks left and right.\nYour chicks *are* your left and right.\nHey! Freddy fucking Mercury! Where the fuck is Kelly?\nThis is Kelly!\nI thought that was the sexy stud.\n*I'm* the sexy stud.\nBut this donkey is a dude!\nKelly can be a guy's name too. Hey!\nWhen it's over, if you want, you can fuck Kelly.\nReally? Sweet!\nYeah.\nIf he's gonna jerk off, I'm gonna jerk off, too\nI don't think he's gonna jerk off.\nMay your first child be a masculine child!\nHow the fuck did you father a child with a chick that's not your fiancé? Holy shit, she got pregnant off the toilet seat you jerked off onto! I fucking knew it!\nDude, I'm pretty sure your old lady wants to get you and me together in a three-way!\nThe Transformers were a total slight against God. In as much as God sent his only begotten son to die on the cross to redeem mankind and all we did to pay him back was make terrible fucking cartoons, like the Transformers.\nDo we have a mop?\nYeah it's in the closet with the other cleaning supplies.\nWe have cleaning supplies?\nI don't mind people snickering at the stupid uniform I've gotta wear, but I'll be damned if I let some self-righteous lucky turd come in here and treat me and Dante like we're a couple of fucking porch monkeys!\nWell, I mean, as you know, my online handle is Optimus Prime.\nI know that. I wish I didn't.\nI thought you weren't even allowed to watch a lot of TV in your house cause you're all Christian and shit.\nWell, as it turns out, cars and trucks that turn into robots aren't really that blasphemous. Because my pastor says that machines can turn into other machines and it's not a slight against God.\nTransformers are a TOTAL slight against God. Inasmuch as God sent his only begotten son to die on the cross to redeem mankind, and all we did to pay him back was make terrible fucking cartoons like the Transformers.\nWhile you guys were gone I had to wait on a guy I gave a blow-job to when I was in 9th grade.\nYeah, I've waited on your brother before, too.\nYou ever see a chick give a mule a blowjob?\nAnd you wonder why no chick will let you stick your cock in her.\nI never wondered that.\nDude, the Transformers sucked.\nOh no they didn't, they're more than meets the eye. \n\nGiven quotes from the character above, which of the following tropes would you say this character represents?\n\nA: Absent Minded Professor\nB: Adventurer Archaeologist\nC: Arrogant Kungfu Guy\nD: Big Man On Campus\nE: Bounty Hunter\nF: Brainless Beauty\nG: Broken Bird\nH: Bromantic Foil\nI: Bruiser With A Soft Center\nJ: Bully\nK: Byronic Hero\nL: Casanova\nM: Chanteuse\nN: Charmer\nO: Child Prodigy\nP: Classy Cat Burglar\nQ: Consummate Professional\nR: Corrupt Corporate Executive\nS: Coward\nT: Crazy Jealous Guy\nU: Crazy Survivalist\nV: Cultured Badass\nW: Dean Bitterman\nX: Dirty Cop\nY: Ditz\nZ: Doormat\nAA: Drill Sargeant Nasty\nAB: Dumb Blonde\nAC: Dumb Muscle\nAD: Eccentric Mentor\nAE: Egomaniac Hunter\nAF: Evil Prince\nAG: Fastest Gun In The West\nAH: Father To His Men\nAI: Final Girl\nAJ: Gadgeteer Genius\nAK: Gentleman Thief\nAL: Granola Person\nAM: Grumpy Old Man\nAN: Hardboiled Detective\nAO: Heartbroken Badass\nAP: Henpecked Husband\nAQ: Hitman With A Heart\nAR: Jerk Jock\nAS: Junkie Prophet\nAT: Klutz\nAU: Loser Protagonist\nAV: Loveable Rogue\nAW: Master Swordsman\nAX: Morally Bankrupt Banker\nAY: Officer And A Gentleman\nAZ: Ophelia\nBA: Playful Hacker\nBB: Prima Donna\nBC: Psycho For Hire\nBD: Pupil Turned To Evil\nBE: Retired Outlaw\nBF: Revenge\nBG: Romantic Runnerup\nBH: Self Made Man\nBI: Slacker\nBJ: Stoner\nBK: Storyteller\nBL: Stupid Crooks\nBM: Surfer Dude\nBN: The Chief\nBO: The Editor\nBP: Tranquil Fury\nBQ: Trickster\nBR: Valley Girl\nBS: Warrior Poet\nBT: Young Gun\n",
    "82": "But they're engaged.\nDoesn't matter, it can't happen.\nWhy not? It's bound to come up.\nIt's impossible. Lois could never have Superman's baby. Do you think her fallopian tubes could handle his sperm? I guarantee he blows a load like a shotgun right through her back. What about her womb? Do you think it's strong enough to carry his child?\nSure, why not?\nHe's an alien, for Christ sake. His Kyrptonian biological makeup is enhanced by Earth's yellow sun. If Lois gets a tan, the kid could kick right through her stomach. Only someone like Wonder Woman has a strong enough uterus to carry his kid. The only way he could bang regular chicks is with a Kryptonite condom, but that would kill him.\nHow is it that I go from the verge of hot Floridian sex with Brandi to Man of Steel coital debates with you in the food court?\nCookie stand isn't part of the food court.\nOf course it is.\nThe food court is downstairs. The cookie stand is upstairs. It not like we're talking quantum physics here.\nThe cookie stands counts as an eatery, eateries are part of the food court.\nBullshit! Eateries that operate within the designated square downstairs qualify as food court. Anything outside, of said designated square, is considered an autonomous unit for mid-mall snacking. Now, if you're going to wax intellectual about the subject...\nOne time my cousin Walter got this cat stuck up his ass. True story. He bought it at our local mall, so the whole fiasco wound up on the news. It was embarrasing for my relatives and all, but next week, he did it again. Different cat, same results, complete with another trip to the emergency room. So, I run into him a week later in the mall and he's buying another cat. And I says to him, \"Jesus, Walt! What are you doing? You know you're just gonna get this cat stuck up your ass too. Why don't you knock it off?\" And he said to me, \"Brodie, how the hell else am I supposed to get the gerbil out?\" My cousin was a weird guy.\nSecond suitor, would you ever make whoopie in public?\nI already did once today.\nBut my cousin Walter jerked off in public once. True story. He was on a plane to New Mexico when all of the sudden the hydraulics went. The plane started spinning around, going out of control, so he decides it's all over and whips it out and starts beating it right there. So all the other passengers take a cue from him and they start whipping it out and beating like mad. So all the passengers are beating off, plummeting to their certain doom, when all of the sudden, snap! The hydraulics kick back in. The plane rights itself and it land safely and everyone puts their pieces or, whatever, you know, away and deboard. No one mentions the phenomenon to anyone else.\nWell, did he cum, or what?\nJesus *Christ*, man! There's just some things you don't talk about in public!\nYou wanna say something?\nYeah. About a million things, but I can't express myself monosyllabically enough for you to understand 'em all.\nYou're giving up? You? You used to be stand-up guy, what happened to him? The guy who punched Amanda Gross's mother after she called him \"low class\".\nThat wasn't me. It was you.\nOh, yeah.\nAnd it wasn't her mother, it was her grandmother.\nNo wonder the bitch went down so fast.\nI took you shopping all the time!\nYou took me where you went shopping, you jerk! You think I care what store in that shitpit dirt mall has the latest Godzilla bootlegs? Do you call eating pizza in the same dive pizzeria every night eating out? Do I give a shit when two major comic book labels are crossing over characters, selling two editions of the same book in varied-ink chromium covers? I'm a girl, damn it! I wanna do girly things! Like fix up someone's hair and get phone calls expressing romantic sentiments!\nIs he gone?\nHalfway to Buy Me Toys by now.\nMan, that bastard's faster than Walt Flanagan's dog...\nAfter all he's done to you, you should still kinda stick it to him.\nHow do you propose I do that?\nYou stinkpalm him.\nStinkpalm?\nYou take your hand and stick it in your ass like this. You been walkin' all day and you're nervous, so no doubt you'll be sweaty as hell.\nYou should see yourself right now, a grown man with his hand down his pants.\nYeah i probably look like my old man. So you shake hands with the guy, \"Hello Mr. Svenning how have you been?\"\nWhats the point?\nYou know how long it takes for that smell to come off? Scrub all you want, it'll stick around for at least two days. How does he explain it to his colleagues and family? They'll think he doesn't know how to wipe his ass properly.\nMeanwhile you yourself are left with a hand that smells like shit.\nSmall price to pay for the smiting of one's enemies.\nSuitor number 3, is your kiss like a soft breeze, a firm handshake or a jackhammer?\nDefinitely a jackhammer, I'm in there with some pressure and when I'm done, you're not the same as before. You're changed.\nWhere do you come up with this shit? That's the cheesiest response to an honest question I have ever heard. I saw you kiss and it wasn't anything like that.\nSuitor #2, you'll have to wait until you're addressed before you respond.\nRichard Dawson, why don't you just go back to your podium until it's time to play The Feud. All right?\nWho the hell did you see me kiss?\nSome dude backstage. I don't know who he was but he seemed unimpressed.\nI didn't kiss any guy backstage. I swear. I'm not gay.\nHey, Suitorette, this guys a homophobe. You heard how repulsed he sounded. Is this the kind of guy you want to spend a vacation with? This hate-monger?\nI don't hate gay people.\nSo you love them?\nYes. I mean no.\nTextbook closet case self-loather. Can't be comfortable with his own sexuality.\nThat's it. You're dead, mallrat! I'm gonna fuck you up beyond repair!\nLadies and gentlemen, this tall drink of water headed my way is a pillar of the shopping community who informed me earlier today of a nefarious plan of his to screw my girlfriend in an extremely uncomfortable place.\nWhat... like the back of a Volkswagen?\nSecond suitor: if we were making whoopee, what sounds would you make?\nWait, what's whoopee?\nYou know, being intimate.\nWhat? Like fucking?\nYeah, who's your favourite New Kid. Yeah, call me Joey. Oh, come on. Don't make me get loose. Yeah, that's right. Call me Donnie. Oh, girl. Oh, please don't go girl.\nGoddamn. This is one wacky game show.\nHey! That girl's only 15!\nAh, 15. I thought she was 36!\nCome on, guys. Tell me you wouldn't have popped her.\nShit, bitch, we're gonna bust up that stage like a high school kegger. We're just gonna outwit Lafours, X-Men style.\nShould I call you Logan, Weapon-X?\nNo, *Wolverine*! Shnickty shnickty shnoine!\nSee, what he's doing is imitating Wolverine's berserker attack with his adamantium claws.\nI never would have guessed.\nMy Grandmother always used to say \"why buy the cow, when you can get the sex for free\".\nShe didn't!\nAll the time, before she became a lesbian on her 60th Birthday, but that's besides the point.\nSay, would you like a chocolate covered pretzel? They're a little melty but damn are they exquisite.\nHow is it that you recall the most trivial events?\nI'll never forget it. How many times do you get to see Smokey fuck the Bandit?\nDidn't I look just like Burt Reynolds?\n, :\nExcept for the moustache.\n, :\nExcept for the moustache.\nHell hath no fury like a woman's scorn for Sega.\nHey, look at that ring. What is that?\nThat is, um, my Junior College class ring. Cum Laude, '69.\nI also hope to cum loud one day, preferably in a 69.\nYou're fucking kidding me! The Easter bunny did this?\nAll I said was that the Easter bunny at the Menlo Park mall was more convincing and he just jumped the railing and knocked me down.\nHe's fucking dead!\nOh let it go, he's under a lot of pressure.\nWhat the hell happened?\nThe guy in the Easter bunny suit kicked his ass.\nI had it coming.\nFuck all that shit! Come on, Silent Bob.\nWhat really happened?\nThe proprietor of Fashionable Male beat a raincheck into my stomach.\nShannon Hamilton?\nYou know that guy?\nI went out with him once after we dated. He tried to screw me some place very uncomfortable.\nWhat? Like the back of a Volkswagen?\nSounds like his M.O.\nYou know about this game show they got goin' on here? We need you guys to somehow ensure that it doesn't happen.\nIs that it? We were gonna do that anyway.\nReally? Why?\nWhat else are we gonna do?\nHow much longer are we gonna be in this chick store? I'm starting to get a mean hard-on.\nThat kid is *back*... on the escalator again!\nThat was too little too late.\nToo little? You said it was a good size!\nThe effort, you retard. The effort was too little too late.\nBut, now that you mention it, when a girl says its a good size, that's a nice way of saying that it's small.\nHey!\nJesus Christ! What the hell gives with the cover boy?\nNone of your business, but he'll kick your ass if he knows what you just pulled.\nAre you insane? The guy looks like a date rapist! Is that my jacket?\nStart the elevator.\nNot until you tell me what the situation is with you and the Sperminator out there! How long has this been going on?\nSince I mustered the good sense to send you packing. He's a much more suitable companion than you any day.\nAre you nuts? The guy's pure testosterone! He's a walking hard-on just looking for a hole!\nWhy do palm reading topless?\nIt makes the news easier to take. She could tell me I was going to die in ten minutes, just as long as she told me topless.\nYour maleness amazes me sometimes.\nI threw her away like a parking ticket.\nSuitor number one. If we fell in love, how would you propose to me?\nWhen Jaws popped out of the water...\nIf we were making whoopee, what kind of noises would you make?\nRrrruff... rr... rruff...\nYou know, that's kind of a personal question, I don't think I should answer that.\nSuitor #2...\nHey, what about me?\nAw Gil, just shut the fuck up!\nWhat are you doing? You promised me breakfast.\nBreakfast, shmreakfast. Look at the score, for Christ's sake. It's only the second period and I'm up 12 to 2. Breakfasts come and go, Rene, but Hartford, \"the Whale,\" they only beat Vancouver once, maybe twice in a lifetime.\nListen, not a year goes by, not a year, that I don't hear about some escalator accident involving some bastard kid which could have easily been avoided had some parent - I don't care which one - but some parent conditioned him to fear and respect that escalator.\nYou have my Punisher War Journal #6, my copy of \"Fletch\" and the remote control to my TV. Now, I know it's going to be hard to give this stuff up because of it's sentimental attachment...\nSentimental attachment? Look, if I have any of that crap it's because you brought it over my house and left it there.\nOkay, then let's talk about coming up with a schedule for visitation rights.\nFor what?\nFor the mall. I figure you can take the odd days, I'll take the even days and weekends. When there's any special feature like a sidewalk sale...\nBrodie, Brodie...\n...or a boat show...\nBrodie! I've always taken you with a grain of salt. On your birthday, when you told me to do a striptease to the theme of \"Mighty Mouse\", I said okay. On prom night at the hotel when you told me to sleep under the bed in case your mother burst in, I did it. And even during my grandmother's funeral when you told my relatives that you could see her nipples through her burial dress, I let that slide.\nBut if you think I'm gonna suffer any of your shit with a smile now that we're broken up, you're in for some serious fucking disappointment!\nMaybe he's calmed down, we'll talk about it reasonably.\nReasonably shmeasonably, you should go over there and give him shit.\nBrandi is the past my friend. You face forward, or you face the possibility of shock and damage.\nYou should learn to heed your own advice.\nWhere the hell did that come from? What's going on here?\nLooks like a stage is being erected.\nWhat is this monstrosity?\nMaybe it's for the Easter Bunny pictures.\nImpossible, the Easter Bunny Court is down at the other end of the mall, it's been there since two days after Christmas. I want answers!\nI would've made a sexy chick!\nYou fuckers think just because a guy reads comics he can't start some shit?\nYou've probably had a slew of women since her, am I right?\nOh, lots of women. Jagger and me, we had a running contest to see who had the most. In fact, last time I checked I was way ahead.\nDAMN that's hot!\nI love the smell of commerce in the morning.\nSuitor Number Three, what would our first date be like?\nWell, uh, first I'd take you shopping to stores you wanna shop in, and then we'd do a little lunch, probably at the Cheese Haus, followed by some golfing. And then at night, we'd take in an opera, probably Die Fledermaus, and then I'd follow it up with a drive to a secluded beach where I'd pop on the radio and we could slow-dance till the sun came up.\nThat was the biggest load of crap I've ever heard! I mean, look at you. You're the kind of guy who would beg for sex. And I should know, we can smell our own.\nHow easily do you quit? Say you wind up with one of us?\nHopefully not Rush Limbaugh over here.\nWell, now, I'm not like Rush Limbaugh.\nWell, why not? Because he's fat? Now you have something against fat people, too?\nT.S. Quint, meet Tricia Jones. They call her \"Trish the Dish.\"\nNobody calls me that.\nYou two are retarded for each other.\nWhy don't they ever bring back or remake good shows, like 'BJ and the Bear.' Now there's a concept I can't get enough of, a man and his monkey.\nYou should see yourself right now - a grown man with his hand down his pants.\nYeah, I probably look like my old man.\nHey, what's going on in there?\nI was warned about you. Take it easy before I have you removed from the mall.\nWarned? What the fuck are you talking about?\nTell him, Steve-Dave!\nFuck you, Fanboy!\nWhen you two testosterone-seething, he-man, comic book fans finish up with this display of tough guy back-and-forth? I have some questions that need answering.\nI was going to propose to her.\nWhere?\nThe Universal Tour.\nYou're kidding. What part?\nWhen Jaws popped out of the water.\nThat's the most romantic thing I've ever heard.\nToo bad I'm not trying to marry you.\nI heard that you were going to propose to Brandi Svenning at some theme park. When are men going to learn that women want ROMANCE, not Mr. Toad's Wild Ride...\nBe fair. EVERYONE wants Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.\nYou're going to listen to *me*? To something that *I* said? Hell, most of the time I'm just talking out of my ass... or sticking my hand in it.\nYeah, and she also said I had no dick. Which precedes the financial question, proving once more what women really look for.\nWhat's he doing?\nShithead here watched Empire and Jedi last week and ever since then, he's been trying to do the Jedi mind trick. The crazy fuck thinks he can levitate shit with his thoughts.\nKnock it off!\nThe force is strong with this one.\nDude, don't encourage him.\nFree your minds.\nI'd like to free something...\nThey look happy, don't they?\nWhat, the bras?\nWoah, she calls you \"callow\" in here.\nYou say that like it's bad.\nIt means frightened and weak-willed.\nReally? Shit. That was the only part of the letter I thought was complimentary.\nOnce I realized the both of you were in the mall together, I decided to set up this little ambush to remove you and your sidekick here from the premises, permanently.\nHey, why am I his side-kick? How do you know he's not *my* side-kick?\nLook, if I had any kind of glow it's because I just got laid. I would look the same had I banged anyone in that elevator... present company excluded.\nDeny it all you want. I think that you're too proud to admit that you want her back.\nI suddenly want something very bad to happen to you.\nSee, that's what you get for fucking with me.\nI call you all time!\n\"Rene, my mom's asleep. Come over.\" You call that romantic? When was the last time you pulled out my chair, or told me I was beautiful?\nAnd this guy does all this in a day?\nThis guy already introduced me to his mother.\nReally?\nWhen I walked away, did you make any effort to repair that breach? No, you ran off and cried on the shoulder of Bumble the Boy Wonder over there.\nBoy Wonder? Hey, I'm all man, lady!\nWant a sip of my soda?\nYou used to like tits too.\nHey, I love tits as much as the next guy, but why should I pay some old hag good money for some supernatural chicanery coupled with a pair of sagging wrinkled weathered boobs?\nTell me about the elevator.\nIt goes up-and-down. Ba-dump-tsss.\nYou're a fickle broad...\nIt's the third nipple that does it.\nOh, you have a third nipple? I didn't notice.\nWhat are you *talking about*? It's as clear as day! Look at it for god's sake!\nYou can stare at it. I don't mind.\nThat is one of your more admirably deplorable traits. You, unlike me, would beat up somebody's grandmother or an entire senior citizens' community if you believed in the principle.\nYeah, but only if they were really old.\nWhy are you glowing?\nI'm *not* glowing!\nThe Thing! Is his dork made out of orange rock like the rest of his body?\nI don't know. It's a superhero secret.\nThey look happy don't they?\nI suppose, as far as couples go.\nYou know, it reminds me of an issue of Spider-man I did. When Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy went lingerie shopping. Of course, the Green Goblin showed up, and he pumpkin-bombed the hell out of the place. But aside from that, it's pretty much the same thing.\nOh, my god... *holy shit*! Aren't you...\nOh, Stan Lee, hi.\nHey, you know where you're going, they screw people in a very uncomfortable place.\nReally?\nYeah.\nHey, hey! You can't strike a prisoner in police custody.\nOh, come on. Just once?\nAll right, but make it fast.\nDid you see that shit? You call that romance?\nI call that illegal.\nSecond Suitor? If you were a comic book character, what character would you be?\nWow! That's a great question. Tough one, though I mean, what does one gauge his response on? Physical prowess? Keen detection skills? The ability to banter well with super villians?\nHow's your comic book collection, Brodie?\nOh it's goin' good. But, I mean...\nOh, comics? what are you talkin' about lady? I don't collect comics! Comics are for kids!\nYou're gonna listen to me? To something I said? Hasn't it become abundantly clear during the tenure of our friendship that I don't know shit?\nTell me, did you ever fart in front of her?\nNo, why do you ask?\nI never farted in front of Renee. Not once. Last week, I let one slip and today she dumps me.\nYou think that's why Renee dumped you? Come on, she's not the shallow type. You're not insinuating...\nShe was going down on me at the time.\n\nWhat can I say, I was feeling very relaxed, when I'm relaxed I squirt.\nIf all she did was dump you, you got off light.\nThe usual vault rules apply: Touch not, lest ye be touched.\nYou're such an anal retentive bastard.\nHey, I tried to teach you how to handle comics in the sixth grade, but oh no. You wanted to play little league instead.\nSilent Bob stole the schematics from some foolish carpenter and found a weakness just like the fucking Death Star. You knock this crossbeam out and, fuckin' bickety-bam, the whole stage comes crashing down.\nWell we were thinking of something simple, but hey, if you want to destroy the stage, we're all for that.\nThere is something out there that can help us ease our simultanious double loss.\nWhat? Ritual suicide?\nNo, you idiot, the fucking mall!\nI'd prefer ritual suicide.\nOh come on man it'll be great. They have these new cookies at the cookie stand, you have to try 'em. They're awesome.\nSmart-ass ex-boyfriend! I've got two things to tell you. One: I don't like you. I see you every week in this mall. I don't like you shiftless layabouts. You're one of those loser fucking mallrat kids. You don't come to the mall to shop or work. You hang out all day, act like you fucking live here. Well, I have no respect for people with no shopping agenda.\nIs this what's known as motivated salesmanship?\nRene told me to leave you alone, but she's fucking clueless. The newly single always feel a bit protective of the ex-boyfriend.\nIf this is her idea of protective, I'd hate to have her mad at me.\nYou see, Bruce, I like to pick up girls on the rebound from a disappointing relationship. They're much more in need of solace and they're fairly open to suggestion. And, I use that to fuck them some place very uncomfortable.\nWhat, like the back of a Volkswagen?\nNo. More like someplace girls dread.\nI got to hit the bathroom.\nPLEASE. Don't say \"hit\".\nCome on, this is the dirt mall. Cops don't come here.\nNeither does any self-respecting consumer.\nDo you really wanna know?\nI asked, didn't I? I'm playing the role; the concerned guy.\nFucussa.\nThat's what I was thinking.\nShe said 'focus'.\nWhatever.\nYou know how when someone lays with their back to you, and you lay behind them really close and you throw one arm over them?\nIt's called spooning.\nYeah, but you gotta put the other arm somewhere. You can either lay on it or shove it between your bodies. The only other option is to stretch it above your head. But sometimes my arm pops out of socket when I'm sleeping like that. So I was constantly searching for someplace to keep my arm while still laying close to her.\nAnd?\nWhat do you mean, 'and'? That's like a metaphor for our whole relationship. I'm all out. I'll meet you at the food court.\nI know exactly how he feels. Excuse me.\nHey Hamilton! Let's try and wrap this up, alright? I promised her breakfast!\nThese should have boards in them. Bloody savage.\nLittle Trisha here is only fifteen, but somehow she's a senior.\nHow did you manage that?\n\nDon't listen to him. I studied my ass off.\nYeah, right. So what do you say? You wanna nail T.S. Or what?\nJesus, Brodie!\nHey guys, you'll never guess who I just met.\nWhat happened to these two?\nPower of the dark side.\nWait a minute. There's only two. There's supposed to be three! What happened to the third guy?\nI never saw a third guy.\nWhat happened to these two?\nUm... they got light headed.\nYou got that right.\nSo, what's going to happen now? They going to cancel the show?\nWhat do you care, asshole?\nI'm supposed to be on it. I'm Gil Hicks, Suitor Number Three.\nWe're gonna take their places. Hi. I'm T.S. Quint, this is my friend Brodie Bruce.\nHey, didn't Svenning have you arrested?\nLook man, don't give him any shit!\nSomething's going on here. Where's Mr. Svenning?\nMr. Svenning has come down with a sudden case of depheria.\nWhat happened to these two?\nThe homeboys got a case of the mad munchies!\nHey, Roddy Roddy, isn't this the guy that Svenning had arrested?\nWhy yes it is. All right Quint, I don't know how you got back in here, but we're postponing the start of the show until I call Mr. Svenning. You've brought down the fire, well now you've got it! Security!\nHey, Roddy!\nSomebody call security? What happened here?\nOh, these two guys got stonned and knocked this guy out. I think he needs medical attention.\nThat's not what happ...\nYeah, could you get him and these two guys out of here? The show's about to start.\nWhatever.\nLook asshole, just go out there with us and behave, and you'll be just fine.\nJay, when Tricia shows up here with a video tape, you give it to Silent Bob.\nCheck. Say, where is that tubby bitch?\nBut they're engaged.\nDoesn't matter, it can't happen.\nWhy not? It's bound to come up.\nIt's impossible. Lois could never have Superman's baby. Do you think her fallopian tubes could handle his sperm? I guarantee he blows a load like a shotgun right through her back. What about her womb? Do you think it's strong enough to carry his child?\nSure, why not?\nHe's an alien, for Christ sake. His Kyrptonian biological makeup is enhanced by Earth's yellow sun. If Lois gets a tan, the kid could kick right through her stomach. Only someone like Wonder Woman has a strong enough uterus to carry his kid. The only way he could bang regular chicks is with a Kryptonite condom, but that would kill him.\nHow is it that I go from the verge of hot Floridian sex with Brandi to Man of Steel coital debates with you in the food court?\nCookie stand isn't part of the food court.\nOf course it is.\nThe food court is downstairs. The cookie stand is upstairs. It not like we're talking quantum physics here.\nThe cookie stands counts as an eatery, eateries are part of the food court.\nBullshit! Eateries that operate within the designated square downstairs qualify as food court. Anything outside, of said designated square, is considered an autonomous unit for mid-mall snacking. Now, if you're going to wax intellectual about the subject...\nOne time my cousin Walter got this cat stuck up his ass. True story. He bought it at our local mall, so the whole fiasco wound up on the news. It was embarrasing for my relatives and all, but next week, he did it again. Different cat, same results, complete with another trip to the emergency room. So, I run into him a week later in the mall and he's buying another cat. And I says to him, \"Jesus, Walt! What are you doing? You know you're just gonna get this cat stuck up your ass too. Why don't you knock it off?\" And he said to me, \"Brodie, how the hell else am I supposed to get the gerbil out?\" My cousin was a weird guy.\nSecond suitor, would you ever make whoopie in public?\nI already did once today.\nBut my cousin Walter jerked off in public once. True story. He was on a plane to New Mexico when all of the sudden the hydraulics went. The plane started spinning around, going out of control, so he decides it's all over and whips it out and starts beating it right there. So all the other passengers take a cue from him and they start whipping it out and beating like mad. So all the passengers are beating off, plummeting to their certain doom, when all of the sudden, snap! The hydraulics kick back in. The plane rights itself and it land safely and everyone puts their pieces or, whatever, you know, away and deboard. No one mentions the phenomenon to anyone else.\nWell, did he cum, or what?\nJesus *Christ*, man! There's just some things you don't talk about in public!\nYou wanna say something?\nYeah. About a million things, but I can't express myself monosyllabically enough for you to understand 'em all.\nYou're giving up? You? You used to be stand-up guy, what happened to him? The guy who punched Amanda Gross's mother after she called him \"low class\".\nThat wasn't me. It was you.\nOh, yeah.\nAnd it wasn't her mother, it was her grandmother.\nNo wonder the bitch went down so fast.\nI took you shopping all the time!\nYou took me where you went shopping, you jerk! You think I care what store in that shitpit dirt mall has the latest Godzilla bootlegs? Do you call eating pizza in the same dive pizzeria every night eating out? Do I give a shit when two major comic book labels are crossing over characters, selling two editions of the same book in varied-ink chromium covers? I'm a girl, damn it! I wanna do girly things! Like fix up someone's hair and get phone calls expressing romantic sentiments!\nIs he gone?\nHalfway to Buy Me Toys by now.\nMan, that bastard's faster than Walt Flanagan's dog...\nAfter all he's done to you, you should still kinda stick it to him.\nHow do you propose I do that?\nYou stinkpalm him.\nStinkpalm?\nYou take your hand and stick it in your ass like this. You been walkin' all day and you're nervous, so no doubt you'll be sweaty as hell.\nYou should see yourself right now, a grown man with his hand down his pants.\nYeah i probably look like my old man. So you shake hands with the guy, \"Hello Mr. Svenning how have you been?\"\nWhats the point?\nYou know how long it takes for that smell to come off? Scrub all you want, it'll stick around for at least two days. How does he explain it to his colleagues and family? They'll think he doesn't know how to wipe his ass properly.\nMeanwhile you yourself are left with a hand that smells like shit.\nSmall price to pay for the smiting of one's enemies.\nSuitor number 3, is your kiss like a soft breeze, a firm handshake or a jackhammer?\nDefinitely a jackhammer, I'm in there with some pressure and when I'm done, you're not the same as before. You're changed.\nWhere do you come up with this shit? That's the cheesiest response to an honest question I have ever heard. I saw you kiss and it wasn't anything like that.\nSuitor #2, you'll have to wait until you're addressed before you respond.\nRichard Dawson, why don't you just go back to your podium until it's time to play The Feud. All right?\nWho the hell did you see me kiss?\nSome dude backstage. I don't know who he was but he seemed unimpressed.\nI didn't kiss any guy backstage. I swear. I'm not gay.\nHey, Suitorette, this guys a homophobe. You heard how repulsed he sounded. Is this the kind of guy you want to spend a vacation with? This hate-monger?\nI don't hate gay people.\nSo you love them?\nYes. I mean no.\nTextbook closet case self-loather. Can't be comfortable with his own sexuality.\nThat's it. You're dead, mallrat! I'm gonna fuck you up beyond repair!\nLadies and gentlemen, this tall drink of water headed my way is a pillar of the shopping community who informed me earlier today of a nefarious plan of his to screw my girlfriend in an extremely uncomfortable place.\nWhat... like the back of a Volkswagen?\nSecond suitor: if we were making whoopee, what sounds would you make?\nWait, what's whoopee?\nYou know, being intimate.\nWhat? Like fucking?\nYeah, who's your favourite New Kid. Yeah, call me Joey. Oh, come on. Don't make me get loose. Yeah, that's right. Call me Donnie. Oh, girl. Oh, please don't go girl.\nGoddamn. This is one wacky game show.\nHey! That girl's only 15!\nAh, 15. I thought she was 36!\nCome on, guys. Tell me you wouldn't have popped her.\nShit, bitch, we're gonna bust up that stage like a high school kegger. We're just gonna outwit Lafours, X-Men style.\nShould I call you Logan, Weapon-X?\nNo, *Wolverine*! Shnickty shnickty shnoine!\nSee, what he's doing is imitating Wolverine's berserker attack with his adamantium claws.\nI never would have guessed.\nMy Grandmother always used to say \"why buy the cow, when you can get the sex for free\".\nShe didn't!\nAll the time, before she became a lesbian on her 60th Birthday, but that's besides the point.\nSay, would you like a chocolate covered pretzel? They're a little melty but damn are they exquisite.\nHow is it that you recall the most trivial events?\nI'll never forget it. How many times do you get to see Smokey fuck the Bandit?\nDidn't I look just like Burt Reynolds?\n, :\nExcept for the moustache.\n, :\nExcept for the moustache.\nHell hath no fury like a woman's scorn for Sega.\nHey, look at that ring. What is that?\nThat is, um, my Junior College class ring. Cum Laude, '69.\nI also hope to cum loud one day, preferably in a 69.\nYou're fucking kidding me! The Easter bunny did this?\nAll I said was that the Easter bunny at the Menlo Park mall was more convincing and he just jumped the railing and knocked me down.\nHe's fucking dead!\nOh let it go, he's under a lot of pressure.\nWhat the hell happened?\nThe guy in the Easter bunny suit kicked his ass.\nI had it coming.\nFuck all that shit! Come on, Silent Bob.\nWhat really happened?\nThe proprietor of Fashionable Male beat a raincheck into my stomach.\nShannon Hamilton?\nYou know that guy?\nI went out with him once after we dated. He tried to screw me some place very uncomfortable.\nWhat? Like the back of a Volkswagen?\nSounds like his M.O.\nYou know about this game show they got goin' on here? We need you guys to somehow ensure that it doesn't happen.\nIs that it? We were gonna do that anyway.\nReally? Why?\nWhat else are we gonna do?\nHow much longer are we gonna be in this chick store? I'm starting to get a mean hard-on.\nThat kid is *back*... on the escalator again!\nThat was too little too late.\nToo little? You said it was a good size!\nThe effort, you retard. The effort was too little too late.\nBut, now that you mention it, when a girl says its a good size, that's a nice way of saying that it's small.\nHey!\nJesus Christ! What the hell gives with the cover boy?\nNone of your business, but he'll kick your ass if he knows what you just pulled.\nAre you insane? The guy looks like a date rapist! Is that my jacket?\nStart the elevator.\nNot until you tell me what the situation is with you and the Sperminator out there! How long has this been going on?\nSince I mustered the good sense to send you packing. He's a much more suitable companion than you any day.\nAre you nuts? The guy's pure testosterone! He's a walking hard-on just looking for a hole!\nWhy do palm reading topless?\nIt makes the news easier to take. She could tell me I was going to die in ten minutes, just as long as she told me topless.\nYour maleness amazes me sometimes.\nI threw her away like a parking ticket.\nSuitor number one. If we fell in love, how would you propose to me?\nWhen Jaws popped out of the water...\nIf we were making whoopee, what kind of noises would you make?\nRrrruff... rr... rruff...\nYou know, that's kind of a personal question, I don't think I should answer that.\nSuitor #2...\nHey, what about me?\nAw Gil, just shut the fuck up!\nWhat are you doing? You promised me breakfast.\nBreakfast, shmreakfast. Look at the score, for Christ's sake. It's only the second period and I'm up 12 to 2. Breakfasts come and go, Rene, but Hartford, \"the Whale,\" they only beat Vancouver once, maybe twice in a lifetime.\nListen, not a year goes by, not a year, that I don't hear about some escalator accident involving some bastard kid which could have easily been avoided had some parent - I don't care which one - but some parent conditioned him to fear and respect that escalator.\nYou have my Punisher War Journal #6, my copy of \"Fletch\" and the remote control to my TV. Now, I know it's going to be hard to give this stuff up because of it's sentimental attachment...\nSentimental attachment? Look, if I have any of that crap it's because you brought it over my house and left it there.\nOkay, then let's talk about coming up with a schedule for visitation rights.\nFor what?\nFor the mall. I figure you can take the odd days, I'll take the even days and weekends. When there's any special feature like a sidewalk sale...\nBrodie, Brodie...\n...or a boat show...\nBrodie! I've always taken you with a grain of salt. On your birthday, when you told me to do a striptease to the theme of \"Mighty Mouse\", I said okay. On prom night at the hotel when you told me to sleep under the bed in case your mother burst in, I did it. And even during my grandmother's funeral when you told my relatives that you could see her nipples through her burial dress, I let that slide.\nBut if you think I'm gonna suffer any of your shit with a smile now that we're broken up, you're in for some serious fucking disappointment!\nMaybe he's calmed down, we'll talk about it reasonably.\nReasonably shmeasonably, you should go over there and give him shit.\nBrandi is the past my friend. You face forward, or you face the possibility of shock and damage.\nYou should learn to heed your own advice.\nWhere the hell did that come from? What's going on here?\nLooks like a stage is being erected.\nWhat is this monstrosity?\nMaybe it's for the Easter Bunny pictures.\nImpossible, the Easter Bunny Court is down at the other end of the mall, it's been there since two days after Christmas.

And then at night, we'd take in an opera, probably Die Fledermaus, and then I'd follow it up with a drive to a secluded beach where I'd pop on the radio and we could slow-dance till the sun came up.\nThat was the biggest load of crap I've ever heard! I mean, look at you. You're the kind of guy who would beg for sex. And I should know, we can smell our own.\nHow easily do you quit? Say you wind up with one of us?\nHopefully not Rush Limbaugh over here.\nWell, now, I'm not like Rush Limbaugh.\nWell, why not? Because he's fat? Now you have something against fat people, too?\nT.S. Quint, meet Tricia Jones. They call her \"Trish the Dish.\"\nNobody calls me that.\nYou two are retarded for each other.\nWhy don't they ever bring back or remake good shows, like 'BJ and the Bear.' Now there's a concept I can't get enough of, a man and his monkey.\nYou should see yourself right now - a grown man with his hand down his pants.\nYeah, I probably look like my old man.\nHey, what's going on in there?\nI was warned about you. Take it easy before I have you removed from the mall.\nWarned? What the fuck are you talking about?\nTell him, Steve-Dave!\nFuck you, Fanboy!\nWhen you two testosterone-seething, he-man, comic book fans finish up with this display of tough guy back-and-forth? I have some questions that need answering.\nI was going to propose to her.\nWhere?\nThe Universal Tour.\nYou're kidding.

Which precedes the financial question, proving once more what women really look for.\nWhat's he doing?\nShithead here watched Empire and Jedi last week and ever since then, he's been trying to do the Jedi mind trick. The crazy fuck thinks he can levitate shit with his thoughts.\nKnock it off!\nThe force is strong with this one.\nDude, don't encourage him.\nFree your minds.\nI'd like to free something...\nThey look happy, don't they?\nWhat, the bras?\nWoah, she calls you \"callow\" in here.\nYou say that like it's bad.\nIt means frightened and weak-willed.\nReally? Shit. That was the only part of the letter I thought was complimentary.\nOnce I realized the both of you were in the mall together, I decided to set up this little ambush to remove you and your sidekick here from the premises, permanently.\nHey, why am I his side-kick?

I think that you're too proud to admit that you want her back.\nI suddenly want something very bad to happen to you.\nSee, that's what you get for fucking with me.\nI call you all time!\n\"Rene, my mom's asleep. Come over.\" You call that romantic? When was the last time you pulled out my chair, or told me I was beautiful?\nAnd this guy does all this in a day?\nThis guy already introduced me to his mother.\nReally?\nWhen I walked away, did you make any effort to repair that breach? No, you ran off and cried on the shoulder of Bumble the Boy Wonder over there.\nBoy Wonder? Hey, I'm all man, lady!\nWant a sip of my soda?\nYou used to like tits too.\nHey, I love tits as much as the next guy, but why should I pay some old hag good money for some supernatural chicanery coupled with a pair of sagging wrinkled weathered boobs?\nTell me about the elevator.\nIt goes up-and-down. Ba-dump-tsss.\nYou're a fickle broad...\nIt's the third nipple that does it.\nOh, you have a third nipple? I didn't notice.\nWhat are you *talking about*? It's as clear as day! Look at it for god's sake!\nYou can stare at it. I don't mind.\nThat is one of your more admirably deplorable traits. You, unlike me, would beat up somebody's grandmother or an entire senior citizens' community if you believed in the principle.\nYeah, but only if they were really old.\nWhy are you glowing?\nI'm *not* glowing!\nThe Thing! Is his dork made out of orange rock like the rest of his body?\nI don't know. It's a superhero secret.\nThey look happy don't they?\nI suppose, as far as couples go.\nYou know, it reminds me of an issue of Spider-man I did. When Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy went lingerie shopping. Of course, the Green Goblin showed up, and he pumpkin-bombed the hell out of the place. But aside from that, it's pretty much the same thing.\nOh, my god... *holy shit*! Aren't you...\nOh, Stan Lee, hi.\nHey, you know where you're going, they screw people in a very uncomfortable place.\nReally?\nYeah.\nHey, hey! You can't strike a prisoner in police custody.\nOh, come on. Just once?\nAll right, but make it fast.\nDid you see that shit? You call that romance?\nI call that illegal.\nSecond Suitor? If you were a comic book character, what character would you be?\nWow! That's a great question. Tough one, though I mean, what does one gauge his response on? Physical prowess? Keen detection skills? The ability to banter well with super villians?\nHow's your comic book collection, Brodie?\nOh it's goin' good. But, I mean...\nOh, comics? what are you talkin' about lady? I don't collect comics! Comics are for kids!\nYou're gonna listen to me? To something I said? Hasn't it become abundantly clear during the tenure of our friendship that I don't know shit?\nTell me, did you ever fart in front of her?\nNo, why do you ask?\nI never farted in front of Renee. Not once. Last week, I let one slip and today she dumps me.\nYou think that's why Renee dumped you? Come on, she's not the shallow type. You're not insinuating...\nShe was going down on me at the time.\n\nWhat can I say, I was feeling very relaxed, when I'm relaxed I squirt.\nIf all she did was dump you, you got off light.\nThe usual vault rules apply: Touch not, lest ye be touched.\nYou're such an anal retentive bastard.\nHey, I tried to teach you how to handle comics in the sixth grade, but oh no. You wanted to play little league instead.\nSilent Bob stole the schematics from some foolish carpenter and found a weakness just like the fucking Death Star. You knock this crossbeam out and, fuckin' bickety-bam, the whole stage comes crashing down.\nWell we were thinking of something simple, but hey, if you want to destroy the stage, we're all for that.\nThere is something out there that can help us ease our simultanious double loss.\nWhat? Ritual suicide?\nNo, you idiot, the fucking mall!\nI'd prefer ritual suicide.\nOh come on man it'll be great. They have these new cookies at the cookie stand, you have to try 'em. They're awesome.\nSmart-ass ex-boyfriend! I've got two things to tell you. One: I don't like you. I see you every week in this mall. I don't like you shiftless layabouts. You're one of those loser fucking mallrat kids. You don't come to the mall to shop or work. You hang out all day, act like you fucking live here. Well, I have no respect for people with no shopping agenda.\nIs this what's known as motivated salesmanship?\nRene told me to leave you alone, but she's fucking clueless. The newly single always feel a bit protective of the ex-boyfriend.\nIf this is her idea of protective, I'd hate to have her mad at me.\nYou see, Bruce, I like to pick up girls on the rebound from a disappointing relationship. They're much more in need of solace and they're fairly open to suggestion. And, I use that to fuck them some place very uncomfortable.\nWhat, like the back of a Volkswagen?\nNo. More like someplace girls dread.\nI got to hit the bathroom.\nPLEASE. Don't say \"hit\".\nCome on, this is the dirt mall. Cops don't come here.\nNeither does any self-respecting consumer.\nDo you really wanna know?\nI asked, didn't I? I'm playing the role; the concerned guy.\nFucussa.\nThat's what I was thinking.\nShe said 'focus'.\nWhatever.\nYou know how when someone lays with their back to you, and you lay behind them really close and you throw one arm over them?\nIt's called spooning.\nYeah, but you gotta put the other arm somewhere. You can either lay on it or shove it between your bodies. The only other option is to stretch it above your head. But sometimes my arm pops out of socket when I'm sleeping like that. So I was constantly searching for someplace to keep my arm while still laying close to her.\nAnd?\nWhat do you mean, 'and'? That's like a metaphor for our whole relationship. I'm all out. I'll meet you at the food court.\nI know exactly how he feels. Excuse me.\nHey Hamilton! Let's try and wrap this up, alright? I promised her breakfast!\nThese should have boards in them. Bloody savage.\nLittle Trisha here is only fifteen, but somehow she's a senior.\nHow did you manage that?\n\nDon't listen to him. I studied my ass off.\nYeah, right. So what do you say? You wanna nail T.S. Or what?\nJesus, Brodie!\nHey guys, you'll never guess who I just met.\nWhat happened to these two?\nPower of the dark side.\nWait a minute. There's only two. There's supposed to be three! What happened to the third guy?\nI never saw a third guy.\nWhat happened to these two?\nUm... they got light headed.\nYou got that right.\nSo, what's going to happen now? They going to cancel the show?\nWhat do you care, asshole?\nI'm supposed to be on it. I'm Gil Hicks, Suitor Number Three.\nWe're gonna take their places. Hi. I'm T.S. Quint, this is my friend Brodie Bruce.\nHey, didn't Svenning have you arrested?\nLook man, don't give him any shit!\nSomething's going on here. Where's Mr. Svenning?\nMr. Svenning has come down with a sudden case of depheria.\nWhat happened to these two?\nThe homeboys got a case of the mad munchies!\nHey, Roddy Roddy, isn't this the guy that Svenning had arrested?\nWhy yes it is. All right Quint, I don't know how you got back in here, but we're postponing the start of the show until I call Mr. Svenning. You've brought down the fire, well now you've got it! Security!\nHey, Roddy!\nSomebody call security? What happened here?\nOh, these two guys got stonned and knocked this guy out. I think he needs medical attention.\nThat's not what happ...\nYeah, could you get him and these two guys out of here? The show's about to start.\nWhatever.\nLook asshole, just go out there with us and behave, and you'll be just fine.\nJay, when Tricia shows up here with a video tape, you give it to Silent Bob.\nCheck.

Yeah, I was out there tryin' to whack these junk bond fuckos and these idiots were flushing game with sticks of dynamite! And the dog that they borrowed, little Budro, was a retriever, get it? Budro was never a target, Budro was acting on instinct. I would never hurt an animal and I'm offended at the accusation...\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, Chatty Cathy! Clip yer string, I don't need to know! But, just for the record, here's what I heard: the marks borrowed your client's prize hunting pup. So, bad luck for Budro and bad luck for Blank. Poodle pumper. Hound hitter. Pooch puncher!\nBut listen, uh, if you wanna go, I can't think of any reason why we wouldn't go together.\nI can.\nKid, I'm putting together a little concern, which would enable those of us in our, uh, rarified profession to avoid embarrassing overlaps.\nWhat, like a union?\nMore like a club. You know, work less, make more.\nWow, sounds like a great idea, but... thank you, no.\nNo? You remember Burma?\nYeah, I do.\nThat nut, General Kwang? You were like a... colonel in that army, weren't you?\nYeah, yeah, he sold you all those tanks, you shipped 'em to Alabama...\nT-34s, I took a bath on that.\nYeah, that was fun.\nThat's what I'm talking about, kid, we could be working together again, for God's sake! You know, making big money, killing important people!\nLook, I don't want to play against you! This thing is real.\nHow real?\nMaranga Brothers, them, uh, East German ex-Stasi guys...\nOh, I don't like those guys.\nThem butch Filipino ladies...\nWhat, the dwarf, maid...\nStabbers! Queens of the hotel hit, you know.\nYou got a great crew.\nEverybody's in!\nYeah well, not me, so don't paw at me with your dirty little guild, okay?\nWhere ya been these last ten years?\nYeah, where ya been, \"Marv\"?\nYa look great!\nThanks. I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.\nYa do not!\nI do! I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland.\nYou're so funny.\nHe's a funny guy. \n\nGiven quotes from the character above, which of the following tropes would you say this character represents?\n\nA: Absent Minded Professor\nB: Adventurer Archaeologist\nC: Arrogant Kungfu Guy\nD: Big Man On Campus\nE: Bounty Hunter\nF: Brainless Beauty\nG: Broken Bird\nH: Bromantic Foil\nI: Bruiser With A Soft Center\nJ: Bully\nK: Byronic Hero\nL: Casanova\nM: Chanteuse\nN: Charmer\nO: Child Prodigy\nP: Classy Cat Burglar\nQ: Consummate Professional\nR: Corrupt Corporate Executive\nS: Coward\nT: Crazy Jealous Guy\nU: Crazy Survivalist\nV: Cultured Badass\nW: Dean Bitterman\nX: Dirty Cop\nY: Ditz\nZ: Doormat\nAA: Drill Sargeant Nasty\nAB: Dumb Blonde\nAC: Dumb Muscle\nAD: Eccentric Mentor\nAE: Egomaniac Hunter\nAF: Evil Prince\nAG: Fastest Gun In The West\nAH: Father To His Men\nAI: Final Girl\nAJ: Gadgeteer Genius\nAK: Gentleman Thief\nAL: Granola Person\nAM: Grumpy Old Man\nAN: Hardboiled Detective\nAO: Heartbroken Badass\nAP: Henpecked Husband\nAQ: Hitman With A Heart\nAR: Jerk Jock\nAS: Junkie Prophet\nAT: Klutz\nAU: Loser Protagonist\nAV: Loveable Rogue\nAW: Master Swordsman\nAX: Morally Bankrupt Banker\nAY: Officer And A Gentleman\nAZ: Ophelia\nBA: Playful Hacker\nBB: Prima Donna\nBC: Psycho For Hire\nBD: Pupil Turned To Evil\nBE: Retired Outlaw\nBF: Revenge\nBG: Romantic Runnerup\nBH: Self Made Man\nBI: Slacker\nBJ: Stoner\nBK: Storyteller\nBL: Stupid Crooks\nBM: Surfer Dude\nBN: The Chief\nBO: The Editor\nBP: Tranquil Fury\nBQ: Trickster\nBR: Valley Girl\nBS: Warrior Poet\nBT: Young Gun\n",
    "87": "The Casket wasn't the only thing you took from Jotunheim that day, was it?\nNo. In the aftermath of the battle I went into the temple and I found a baby. Small for a Giant's offspring, abandoned, suffering, left to die. Laufey's son.\nLaufey's son?\nYes.\nWhy? You were knee-deep in Jotun blood. Why would you take me?\nYou were an innocent child.\nNo. You took me for a purpose. What was it?... TELL ME!\nI thought we could unite our kingdoms one day. Bring about an alliance, bring about permanent peace... through you.\nWhat?\nBut those plans no longer matter.\nSo I am no more than another stolen relic, locked up here until you might have use of me?\nWhy do you twist my words?\nYou could have told me what I was from the beginning! Why didn't you?\nYou're my son... I wanted only to protect you from the truth...\nWhat, because I... I... I am the monster parents tell their children about at night?\nNo! No!\nYou know, it all makes sense now, why you favored Thor all these years, because no matter how much you claim to love me, you could never have a Frost Giant sitting on the throne of Asgard!\nGuards! Guards, please help!\nYou are a vain, greedy, cruel boy!\nAnd you are an old man and a fool!\nYes... I was a fool, to think you were ready.\nFather...\nFIE!\nThor Odinson... you have betrayed the express command of your king. Through your arrogance and stupidity, you've opened these peaceful realms and innocent lives to the horror and desolation of war! You are unworthy of these realms, you're unworthy of your title, you're unworthy... of the loved ones you have betrayed! I now take from you your power! In the name of my father and his father before, I, Odin Allfather, cast you out!\nI never wanted the throne, I only ever wanted to be your equal!\nLoki, this is madness!\nIs it madness? Is it? IS IT? I don't know what happened on Earth to make you so soft! Don't tell me it was that woman?... Oh, it was. Well maybe, when we're done here, I'll pay her a visit myself!\nI could have done it, Father! I could have done it! For you! For all of us!\nNo, Loki.\nLoki, no... NO!\nWhy have you done this?\nTo prove to Father that I am a worthy son! When he wakes, I will have saved his life, I will have destroyed that race of monsters, and I will be true heir to the throne!\nYou can't kill an entire race!\nWhy not?... And what is this new found love for the Frost Giants? You, could have killed them all with your bare hands!\nI've changed.\nSo have I. Now fight me!\nKill him.\nAfter all I've done for you?\n...So you're the one who showed us the way into Asgard.\nThat was just a bit of fun, really. To ruin my brother's big day, and to protect the realm from his idiotic rule for a while longer.\nI will hear you.\nI will conceal you and a handful of your soldiers, lead you into Odin's chambers, and you can slay him where he lies.\nWhy not kill him yourself?\nI suspect that the Asgardians would not take kindly to a king who had murdered his predecessor. Once Odin is dead, I will return the Casket to you...\nAnd you can return Jotunheim to all its, uh... glory.\nI... accept.\nLook at you. The mighty Thor! With all your strength! And what good does it do you now? Do you hear me, brother? There's nothing you can do!\nWhat are you doing? If you destroy the Bridge, you'll never see her again!\nForgive me, Jane!\nLoki. What are you doing here?\nI had to see you.\nWhat's happened? Tell me, is it Jotunheim? Let me explain to Father...\nFather is dead.\nWhat?\nYour banishment, the threat of a new war... it was too much for him to bear. You mustn't blame yourself. I know that you loved him. I tried to tell him so, but he wouldn't listen. It was so cruel to put the hammer within your reach knowing that you could never lift it. The burden of the throne has fallen to me now.\nCan I come home?\nThe truce with Jotunheim is conditional upon your exile.\nYes, but... couldn't we find a way...?\nAnd Mother has forbidden your return. This is goodbye, brother. I'm so sorry.\nNo. I am sorry. Thank you for coming here.\nFarewell.\nGoodbye.\n\"Goodbye?\" I just got back.\nThe house of Odin is full of traitors...\nDo not dishonor my father's name with your lies!\nYour father is a murderer and a thief! And why have YOU come, to talk of peace? You long for battle, you crave it! You're nothing more than a boy trying to prove himself a man!\nBe warned, this boy grows tired of your mockery!\nThor, stop and think. Look around you, we're outnumbered...\nKnow your place, brother!\nYou know not what your actions would unleash... I do. Go now, while I still allow it.\nWe will accept your most gracious offer. Come on, brother...\nRun back home, little princess.\nDamn...\nNext?\nDr. Selvig.\nSo, you're the man behind all this? It's quite a labyrinth. I was thinking that you had taken me down here to kill me.\nI've been hearing about the New Mexico situation. Your work has impressed a lot of people who are much smarter than I am.\nI had a lot to work with: the Foster theory, a gateway to another dimension... it's unprecedented...\n...isn't it?\nLegend tells us one thing; history, another. But, every now and then, we find something that belongs to both.\nWhat is it?\nPower, Doctor. If we figure out how to tap it, maybe unlimited power.\nWell, I guess that's worth a look.\nWell, I guess that's worth a look.\nIt's unwise to be in my company right now, brother. Today was to be my day of triumph!\nIt'll come, in time. If it's any consolation, I think you're right. About the Frost Giants, about Laufey, about everything. If they were able to slip past Asgard's defenses once, who's to say they won't try again? Next time with an army.\nExactly!\nThere's nothing you can do without defying Father.\nNo! No, no, no, no! I know that look!\nIt's the only way to ensure the safety of our borders!\nThor, it's madness!\nLoki, you must go to the All-Father and convince him to change his mind.\nAnd if I do, then what? I love Thor more dearly than any of you, but you know what he is. He's arrogant, he's reckless, he's dangerous! You saw how he was today. Is that what Asgard needs from its King?\nHe may speak for the good of Asgard, but he's always been jealous of Thor!\nWe should be grateful to him. He saved our lives.\nLaufey said, there were traitors in the house of Odin. A master of magic could bring three Jotuns into Asgard.\nLoki's always been one for mischief, but you're talking about something else entirely!\nWhy don't you tell her? How you sent the Destroyer to kill our friends, to kill me!\nWhat?\nWell, I must have been enforcing father's last command.\nYou're a talented liar, brother. Always have been.\nIt's good to have you back. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to destroy Jotunheim!\nTell me, Loki, how did you lead the Jotuns into Asgard?\nDo you think the Bifrost is the only way in and out of this realm? There are passages between worlds to which even you, with all your gifts, are blind. But I have need of them no longer, now that I am king. And I say, for your act of treason, you are relieved of your duties as gatekeeper and no longer citizen of Asgard!\nThen I need no longer obey you!\nIt's said you can still hear and see what transpires around you. I hope it's true, so that you may know your death came at the hand of Laufey.\nAnd YOUR death came by the son of Odin!\nI will not fight you, brother!\nI'm not your brother! I never was!\nLeave this to me. Gatekeeper, we seek...\nYou're not dressed warmly enough.\nI'm sorry?\nYou think you can deceive me.\nYou must be mistaken...\nEnough! Heimdall, may we pass?\nNEVER has an enemy escaped my watch until this day. I want to know how it happened.\nAnd tell no one where we have gone until we return. Understand?\nWhat's the matter, silver tongue turned to lead?\nHow do I look?\nLike a king.\nSTOP!\nAm I cursed?\nNo.\nWhat am I?\nYou are my son.\nWhat more than that?\nSo why did he lie?\nHe kept the truth from you so you would never feel different. You are our son, Loki, and we your family.\nWhat troubles you, gatekeeper?\nI turned my gaze upon you in Jotunheim but could neither see you nor hear you. You were shrouded from me like the Frost Giants that had entered this realm.\nPerhaps your senses have weakened after your many years of service.\nOr perhaps someone has found a way to hide that which he does not wish me to see.\nYou have great power, Heimdall. Did Odin fear you?\nNo.\nAnd why is that?\nBecause he is my king, and I am sworn to obey him.\nHe was your king. And you're sworn to obey me now. Yes?\nYes.\nThen you'll open the Bifrost to no-one! Until I have repaired the damage that my brother has done!\nEnsure my brother does not return. Destroy everything.\nAllfather, we must speak with you urgently...\nMy friends.\nWhere is Odin?\nFather has fallen into the Odinsleep. Mother fears he may never awaken again.\nWe would speak with her...\nShe has refused to leave my father's bedside. You can bring your urgent matter to me, your King.\nMy King, we would ask that you end Thor's banishment.\nMy first command cannot be to undo the Allfather's last. We're on the brink of war with Jotunheim. Our people need a sense of continuity, in order to feel safe in these difficult times. All of us must stand together, for the good of Asgard.\nYes... of course.\nGood. Then you will wait for my word.\nIf I may, beg the indulgence of your Majesty, to perhaps reconsider...\nWe're done!\nWe should never have let him go...\nAt least he's only banished, not dead. Which is what we'd all be if that guard hadn't told Odin where we'd gone.\nHow did the guard even know?\nI told him.\nWhat?\nI told him to go to Odin, after we'd left. He should be flogged for taking so long, we should never have reached Jotunheim...\nYOU told the guard?\nI saved our lives, and Thor's! I had no idea Father would banish him for what he did.\nThor!\nWE MUST GO!\nThen go!\nWe mustn't lose hope that your father will return to us, and your brother...\nWhat hope is there for Thor?\nThere's always a purpose to everything your father does.\nThe Casket wasn't the only thing you took from Jotunheim that day, was it?\nNo. In the aftermath of the battle I went into the temple and I found a baby. Small for a Giant's offspring, abandoned, suffering, left to die. Laufey's son.\nLaufey's son?\nYes.\nWhy? You were knee-deep in Jotun blood.

    "88": "Allow me to be frank at the commencement. You will not like me. The gentlemen will be envious and the ladies will be repelled. You will not like me now and you will like me a good deal less as we go on. Ladies, an announcement: I am up for it, all the time. That is not a boast or an opinion, it is bone hard medical fact. I put it round you know. And you will watch me putting it round and sigh for it. Don't. It is a deal of trouble for you and you are better off watching and drawing your conclusions from a distance than you would be if I got my tarse up your petticoats. Gentlemen. Do not despair, I am up for that as well. And the same warning applies. Still your cheesy erections till I have had my say. But later when you shag - and later you will shag, I shall expect it of you and I will know if you have let me down - I wish you to shag with my homuncular image rattling in your gonads. Feel how it was for me, how it is for me and ponder. 'Was that shudder the same shudder he sensed? Did he know something more profound? Or is there some wall of wretchedness that we all batter with our heads at that shining, livelong moment. That is it. That is my prologue, nothing in rhyme, no protestations of modesty, you were not expecting that I hope. I am John Wilmot, Second Earl of Rochester and I do not want you to like me.\nAll men would be cowards if they only had the courage.\nThis is your first season on the London stage?\nIt is, my lord.\nMrs. Barry, you must acquire the trick of ignoring those who do not like you. In my experience, those who do not like you fall into two categories: The stupid and the envious. The stupid will like you in five years time. The envious, never.\nDid you miss me?\nI missed the money.\nGood. I don't like a whore with sentiment.\nBut life is not a succession of urgent \"nows\". It's a listless trickle of \"why should I's\".\nIf god wants men to have faith, why does he not make us more disposed to believe?\nMost men are so disposed.\nBut not me.\nThis fellow is my servant. He has just filched two shillings from my coat pocket.\nA thief and a rogue.\nMy lord, you express it.\nHaven't quite got the hang of the reign yet, have you?\nI will not employ a thief.\nThen I will.\nHow much was your master paying you?\nSix shillings a week, sir.\nWho talks of thieving?\nMy lord, Alice Twoumy has sent word. Her child is sick and she shan't come.\nWhat was to be her role?\nShe was playing \"Little Clitoris.\"\nOf course. Alcock! This is your moment. You will stand in for her.\nNo, my lord.\nI beg your pardon?\nI'm Alcock. \"Little Clitoris\" is beyond my range.\nSo here he lies at the last. The deathbed convert. The pious debauchee. Could not dance a half measure, could I? Give me wine, I drain the dregs and toss the empty bottle at the world. Show me our Lord Jesus in agony and I mount the cross and steal his nails for my own palms. There I go, shuffling from the world. My dribble fresh upon the bible.

I must have others do it for me here in the theatre.\nYou are spoken of as a man with a stomach for life.\nI am the cynic of our golden age. This bounteous dish, which our great Charles and our great God have more or less in equal measure placed before us, sets my teeth permanently on edge. Life has no purpose. It is everywhere undone by arbitrariness. I do this and it matters not a jot if I do the opposite. But in the playhouse every action, good or bad, has it's consequences. Drop a handkerchief and it will return to smother you. The theatre is my drug. And my illness is so far advanced that my physic must be of the highest quality.\nMy lord, on these conditions, I endeavour to do what you want.\nHow old are you, Mr Downs?\nEighteen, my lord.\nYoung man, you will die of this company. Do not laugh, I'm serious.\nAnd yet you do not draw the moral of the incident.\nWhich is?\nThat any experiment of interest in life will be carried out at your own expense. Mark it well.\nAh, to die onstage at the hands of a beautiful woman.\nI am no such!\nWhen I wake in the country, I dream of being in London. When I get here, it's full of people like you.\nWell freeze my piss if the royal finger ain't beckoning me. How exciting.\nI don't mean to upset people, but I must speak my mind. For what's in my mind is far more interesting than what's outside my mind.\nMakes you impossible to live with, though. You see?\nDid I once praise you for your blunt manner?\nIt was your reason for employing me.\nIt could as easy be your grounds for dismissal.\nThe entire piece has been devised with the French in mind. In France, fornication in the streets with total strangers is *compulsory*.\nI shall never forgive you for teaching me how to love life.\nI handed you a chance to show your shining talent and what do you give me in return? A pornographic representation of a royal court where the men only deal in buggery and the women's sole object of interest is the dildo!\nA monument to your reign!\nGive you your first London spurt of the summer.\nI brought the wife with me.\nBit of a waste shooting good jism up the lawful.\nWhat is your name?\nAlcock.\nLike master, like servant.\nYour father spirited me out of England when my life was at stake, so I looked after him and after you.\nYou put me in the Tower.\nAnd I let you out. The time has come for you to pay your dues. People listen to you, Johnny. If you took your seat in the Lords, you could make great speeches that would influence events. Anyone can oppose, it's fun to be against things, but there comes a time when you have to start being for things as well.\nYou abducted me in a coach like this when I was still a virgin heiress.\nAnd did you like abduction?\nPassionately.\nThat would not be appropriate for a man of breeding.\nIf you had ever loved a man, you would say that speech with regret because you would fear the loss of him.\nAnd supposing I have loved?\nThen show me in the speech.\nI am come to train you... in your acting.\nSo you said when we first met, but your reputation being what it is, I thought you meant something different.\nI have, I hope, many reputations.\nI love London. Everyone catches its generous spirit so quickly.\n\"And wit was his vain frivolous pretence of pleasing others, at his own expense.\"\nYou are one of life's understudies!\nMy lord!\nI asked for no interruption.\nMy suit is one of the utmost urgency: the stage direction at the end of this scene requires, in my opinion, some authorial exposition.\nIt seems straightforward enough.\nYes, um,\n\"Then dance six naked men and women, the men doing obedience to the women's cunts, kissing and touching them often, the women in like manner to the men's pricks, kissing and dandling their cods and then fall to fucking, after which the women sigh and the men look simple and so sneak off.\" The end of the second act.\nA strong scene, an eminently playable scene, and though I say it myself, a climactic one.\nAnd w-will the kind of equipment that that young lady has in her hand\nbe available for gentlemen for... strapping around the middle for the execution of this scene?\nI had not envisioned you to be so encumbered; I feel this scene should be given... in the flesh.\nAnd will we give... two performances on the day?\nNo, Mr. Harris.\nI am glad to hear that from the author.\nWith the dress rehearsal, the court performance and the public showing, I envisage three.\nRight; I don't know if you've met my regular understudy, Mr. Lightman, he's a most dependable fellow.\nSir, you have the honour of playing *my* understudy.\nWell, I shall take this opportunity to withdraw from the engagement.\nYou are one of *life's* understudies!\nI wish to be moved. I cannot feel in life. I must have others do it for me in theater.\nI told you.\nJohnny, you finally did something for me.\nI didn't do it for you, I did it for me.\nInk! Ink! Bring me ink!\nNot drink, lump! Ink!\nAnyone can drink.\nNot many can match my determination.\nI never wanted you for a mistress, Lizzy. I wanted you for my wife.\nOh, written a new play has he? All those afternoons pretending to slope of and roger his mistress, like a decent chap, he was lurking in his rooms poking away at a play. That is disgusting, George.\nGive me a major work of literature and I'll give you 500 guineas.\nWhen would you like it? Friday?\nI am nature. you are art. Let us see how we compare.\nThe theatre is my drug, and my illness is so far advanced that my physic must be of the highest quality.\nThere is spirit in her.\nWhen a gent sees the spirit, and not the eyes or the tits, then a gent is in trouble.\nI can't get money out of Louis unless I dissolve Parliament, and I can't get money out of Parliament unless I fight Louis.\nWell, choose.\nI need money from both of them.\nIs the fault mine? If I were a better wife would you not need the whorehouse and the inn?\nEvery man needs the whorehouse and the inn.\nAllow me to be frank at the commencement. You will not like me. The gentlemen will be envious and the ladies will be repelled. You will not like me now and you will like me a good deal less as we go on. Ladies, an announcement: I am up for it, all the time. That is not a boast or an opinion, it is bone hard medical fact. I put it round you know. And you will watch me putting it round and sigh for it. Don't. It is a deal of trouble for you and you are better off watching and drawing your conclusions from a distance than you would be if I got my tarse up your petticoats. Gentlemen. Do not despair, I am up for that as well. And the same warning applies. Still your cheesy erections till I have had my say. But later when you shag - and later you will shag, I shall expect it of you and I will know if you have let me down - I wish you to shag with my homuncular image rattling in your gonads. Feel how it was for me, how it is for me and ponder. 'Was that shudder the same shudder he sensed? Did he know something more profound? Or is there some wall of wretchedness that we all batter with our heads at that shining, livelong moment. That is it. That is my prologue, nothing in rhyme, no protestations of modesty, you were not expecting that I hope. I am John Wilmot, Second Earl of Rochester and I do not want you to like me.\nAll men would be cowards if they only had the courage.\nThis is your first season on the London stage?\nIt is, my lord.\nMrs. Barry, you must acquire the trick of ignoring those who do not like you. In my experience, those who do not like you fall into two categories: The stupid and the envious. The stupid will like you in five years time. The envious, never.\nDid you miss me?\nI missed the money.\nGood. I don't like a whore with sentiment.\nBut life is not a succession of urgent \"nows\". It's a listless trickle of \"why should I's\".\nIf god wants men to have faith, why does he not make us more disposed to believe?\nMost men are so disposed.\nBut not me.\nThis fellow is my servant. He has just filched two shillings from my coat pocket.\nA thief and a rogue.\nMy lord, you express it.\nHaven't quite got the hang of the reign yet, have you?\nI will not employ a thief.\nThen I will.\nHow much was your master paying you?\nSix shillings a week, sir.\nWho talks of thieving?\nMy lord, Alice Twoumy has sent word. Her child is sick and she shan't come.\nWhat was to be her role?\nShe was playing \"Little Clitoris.\"\nOf course. Alcock! This is your moment. You will stand in for her.\nNo, my lord.\nI beg your pardon?\nI'm Alcock. \"Little Clitoris\" is beyond my range.\nSo here he lies at the last. The deathbed convert. The pious debauchee. Could not dance a half measure, could I? Give me wine, I drain the dregs and toss the empty bottle at the world. Show me our Lord Jesus in agony and I mount the cross and steal his nails for my own palms. There I go, shuffling from the world. My dribble fresh upon the bible. I look upon a pinhead and I see angels dancing. Well? Do you like me now? Do you like me now? Do you like me now? Do you like me... now?\nI wish to be moved. I cannot feel in life. I must have others do it for me here in the theatre.\nYou are spoken of as a man with a stomach for life.\nI am the cynic of our golden age.

Hi. How ya doin'?\nWe made it.\nHer hair glows!\nWe're alive. We're alive!\nI didn't see that coming.\nEugene.\nThe hair actually glows.\nEugene.\nWhy does her hair glow!\nEugene!\nWhat?\nIt doesn't *just* glow.\nWhy is he smiling at me?\nOh... oh no... where is my satchel?\nI've hidden it. Somewhere you'll never find it.\nIt's in that pot, isn't it?\nRapunzel?\nEugene!\nDid I ever tell you I've got a thing for brunettes?\nGo. Live your dream.\nI will.\nYour dream stinks. I was talking to her.\nThat's a lot of hair.\nShe's growing it out.\nFrying pans... who knew, right?\nBut I know what the big question is? Did Rapunzel and I ever get married? Well I am happy to say after years and years of asking, I finally said yes.\nEugene!\nOkay, okay. I asked her.\nAnd we're living happily ever after!\nYes we are.\nI have made the decision to trust you.\nA horrible decision really.\nYou smell that? Take a deep breath through the nose.\nReally let that seep in. What are you getting? Because to me, that's part man-smell, and the other part is really bad man-smell. I don't know why, but overall it just smells like the color brown. Your thoughts?\nIs it ruffians? Thugs? Have they come for me?\nStay calm. It can probably smell fear.\nSomething brought you here, Flynn Rider. Call it what you will... fate... destiny...\nA horse.\nI could get used to a view like this. Yep, I'm used to it. Guys I want a castle.\nYou should know that this is the strangest thing I've ever done!\n... How 'bout best two out of three?\nLet me just get this straight, I take you to see the lanterns, bring you back home, and you'll give me back my satchel?\nI promise.\nAnd when I promise something, I never ever break that promise.\nEVER!\nAll right, listen! I didn't want to have to do this, but you leave me no choice. Here comes the smolder.\nThis is kind of an off-day for me. This doesn't normally happen.\nFine! I'll take you to see the lanterns.\nReally?\nOops.\nYou broke my smolder.\nNo... no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, this is bad, this is very very bad, this is really bad... They just can't get my nose right!\nWho cares?\nWell, it's easy for you to say...\n... You guys look amazing.\nHead down.\nHead down.\nArms in.\nArms in.\nKnees apart.\nKnees apart... Knees apart?\nWhat about you?\nI'm sorry, me?\nWhat's your dream?\nNo, no no. Sorry, boys. I don't sing.\nYou were my new dream.\nAnd you were mine.\nThe party lasted an entire week, and honestly, I don't remember most of it.\nSo, what do you want with my hair? To cut it?\nWhat?\nSell it?\nNo! Listen, the only thing I want to do with your hair is to get out of it... lit-er-a-lly!\nIs that blood in your mustache?\nGoldie, look at this! Look at all the blood in his mustache! Good sir, that's a lot of blood!\nThis is the story of how I died. Don't worry, this is actually a very fun story and the truth is, it isn't even mine. This is the story of a girl named Rapunzel.\n\nYou know, I can't help but notice you seem a little at war with yourself here.\nWhat?\nNow, I'm only picking up bits and pieces here, of course. Overprotective mother, forbidden road trip. I mean, this is serious stuff. But let me ease your conscience. This is part of growing up. A little rebellion, a little adventure, that's good. Healthy, even.\nYou think?\nI know. You're way over thinking this, trust me. Does your mother deserve it? No. Would this break her heart and crush her soul? Of course. But you've just got to do it.\nBreak her heart?\nIn half.\nCrush her soul?\nLike a grape.\nShe would be heartbroken. You're right.\nI am, aren't I? Oh, bother.\nAll right. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm letting you out of the deal.\nWhat?\nThat's right, but don't thank me. Let's turn around and get you home. Here's your pan, here's your frog.\nI get back my satchel and you get back a mother-daughter relationship based on mutual trust, and violà, we part ways as unlikely friends.\nNo. I am seeing those lanterns.\nOh, come on! What is it going to take for me to get my satchel back?\nI will use this.\nIs this you?\nOh, now they're just being mean.\nHey, Max!\nWhat? I bought them!\n... *most* of them!\nHa! You should see your faces because you look -\n... ridiculous.\nSo! Hey can I ask you something? Is there any chance that I'm going to get super strength in my hand? Because I'm not gonna lie, that would be stupendous... Hey, you alright?\nOh. Sorry yes, just... lost in thought I guess.\nI mean because here's the thing. Superhuman good looks, I've always had them. Born with it. But superhuman strength, can you imagine the possibilities of this?\nI have something for you too.\nI should have given it to you before, but I was scared. And the thing is, I'm not scared anymore. You know what I mean?\nI'm starting to.\nSo! You're being strangely cryptic as you wrap your magic hair around my injured hand.\nSorry! Just, don't... don't freak out.\n\nPlease don't freak out!\nI'm not freaking out. Are you freaking out? No, I'm just very interested in your hair and the magical qualities that it possesses. How long has it been doing that, exactly?\nUh, forever, I guess. Mother says when I was a baby, people tried to cut it. They wanted to take it for themselves. But once it's cut, it turns brown and loses its power.\nA gift like that, it has to be protected. That's why Mother never let me... that's why I never left, and...\nYou never left that tower. And you're still gonna go back?\nNo! Yes. Ugh. It's complicated. So, Eugene Fitzherbert, huh?\nYeah, well, I'll spare you the sob story of poor orphan Eugene Fitzherbert. It's a little bit of a... It's a little bit of a downer.\nHuh. There was this book. A book I used to read every night to all the younger kids, \"The Tales of Flynnagan Rider.\" Swashbuckling rogue, richest man alive, not bad with the ladies, either. Not that he'd ever brag about it, of course.\nHmm. Was he a thief, too?\nWell, no. Actually he had enough money to do anything that he wanted to do. He could go anywhere that he wanted to go. And - and for a kid with nothing, I don't know. It just seemed like the better option. You can't tell anyone about this, okay? It could ruin my whole reputation.\nAh. We wouldn't want that.\nWell, a fake reputation is all a man has. Um, well I should um... I - I should get some more firewood.\nHey. For the record, I like Eugene Fitzherbert much better than Flynn Rider.\nWell, then you'd be the first. But thank you.\nAll right, okay, give me a boost, and I'll pull you up.\nGive us the satchel first.\nWhat? I just... I can't believe that after all we've been through together, you don't... trust me?\nOuch.\nNow help us up, pretty boy.\nSorry... my hands are full.\nWell, I hope you're here to apologize.\nWell, I've gotta say, I didn't know you had that in you back there. That was pretty impressive.\nI know!\nI know. So, Flynn, where are you from?\nWhoa, whoa. Sorry, blondie, I don't do backstory. However, I am becoming very interested in yours. Now, I know I'm not supposed to mention the hair.\nNope.\nOr the mother.\nUnh-unh.\nFrankly, I'm too scared to ask about the frog.\nChameleon.\nNuance. Here's my question, though. If you want to see the lanterns so badly, why haven't you gone before?\nUh, heh, well...\nUh, Flynn?\nFlynn?\nRider!\nRun! Run!\nThis is all my fault. She was right. I never should've done this. I'm so, I'm so sorry, Flynn.\nEugene.\nWhat?\nMy real name is Eugene Fitzherbert. Someone might as well know.\nHmm. I have magic hair that glows when I sing.\nWhat?\nI have magic hair that glows when I sing!\nFlower, gleam and glow. Let your power shine.\nWhat about you?\nI'm sorry, me?\nWhat's your dream?\nNo, no, no. Sorry boys, I don't sing.\nI have dreams like you, no really, just much less touchy-feely, / They mainly happen somewhere warm and sunny, / On an island that I own, Tanned and rested and alone, / Surrounded by enormous piles of money.\nI've got a dream,\nShe's got a dream,\nI've got a dream,\nShe's got a dream,\nI just want to see the floating lanterns gleam, / And with every passing hour, I'm so glad I left my tower, / Like all you lovely folks, I've got a dream.\nShe's got a dream, he's got a dream, / I've got a dream, he's got a dream, / So our differences ain't really that extreme, / We're one big team...\nCall us brutal,\nSay sadistic,\nAnd grotesquely optimistic,\n'Cause way down deep inside, we've got a dream.\nI've got a dream, I've got a dream, I've got a dream, I've got a dream,\nYes, way down deep inside, I've got a dream!\nWhat is this?\nOpen up!\nWhat's the password?\nWhat?\nNope.\nOpen this door!\nNot even close.\nYou have three seconds! One... two... three...\nHuh?\nFrying pans! Who knew, right?\nNot the nose, not the nose, not the nose!\nPut him down! Okay, I don't know where I am, and I need him to take me to see the lanterns, because I've been dreaming about them my entire life. Find your humanity! Haven't any of you ever had a dream?\nI had a dream once.\nI'm malicious, mean, and scary, my sneer could curdle dairy, and violence-wise, my hands are not the cleanest. But despite my evil look and my temper and my hook, I've always yearned to be a concert pianist.\nCan't you see me on the stage, performing Mozart, Tickling the ivories 'till they gleam? Yep, I'd rather be called deadly, for my killer show tune medley.\nThank you!\n'Cause way down deep inside I've got a dream!\nHe's got a dream, he's got a dream.\nSee, I ain't as cruel and vicious as I seem, though I feel like breaking femurs, you can count me with the dreamers, for like everybody else, I've got a dream! \n\nGiven quotes from the character above, which of the following tropes would you say this character represents?\n\nA: Absent Minded Professor\nB: Adventurer Archaeologist\nC: Arrogant Kungfu Guy\nD: Big Man On Campus\nE: Bounty Hunter\nF: Brainless Beauty\nG: Broken Bird\nH: Bromantic Foil\nI: Bruiser With A Soft Center\nJ: Bully\nK: Byronic Hero\nL: Casanova\nM: Chanteuse\nN: Charmer\nO: Child Prodigy\nP: Classy Cat Burglar\nQ: Consummate Professional\nR: Corrupt Corporate Executive\nS: Coward\nT: Crazy Jealous Guy\nU: Crazy Survivalist\nV: Cultured Badass\nW: Dean Bitterman\nX: Dirty Cop\nY: Ditz\nZ: Doormat\nAA: Drill Sargeant Nasty\nAB: Dumb Blonde\nAC: Dumb Muscle\nAD: Eccentric Mentor\nAE: Egomaniac Hunter\nAF: Evil Prince\nAG: Fastest Gun In The West\nAH: Father To His Men\nAI: Final Girl\nAJ: Gadgeteer Genius\nAK: Gentleman Thief\nAL: Granola Person\nAM: Grumpy Old Man\nAN: Hardboiled Detective\nAO: Heartbroken Badass\nAP: Henpecked Husband\nAQ: Hitman With A Heart\nAR: Jerk Jock\nAS: Junkie Prophet\nAT: Klutz\nAU: Loser Protagonist\nAV: Loveable Rogue\nAW: Master Swordsman\nAX: Morally Bankrupt Banker\nAY: Officer And A Gentleman\nAZ: Ophelia\nBA: Playful Hacker\nBB: Prima Donna\nBC: Psycho For Hire\nBD: Pupil Turned To Evil\nBE: Retired Outlaw\nBF: Revenge\nBG: Romantic Runnerup\nBH: Self Made Man\nBI: Slacker\nBJ: Stoner\nBK: Storyteller\nBL: Stupid Crooks\nBM: Surfer Dude\nBN: The Chief\nBO: The Editor\nBP: Tranquil Fury\nBQ: Trickster\nBR: Valley Girl\nBS: Warrior Poet\nBT: Young Gun\n",

Doctor Hathaway's gonna hear all about this. You'll rue the day!\n\"Rue the day?\" Who talks like that?\nWell, how'd you do?\nHow'd I do? I passed! But I failed! Yeah!\nWell, then I'm happy and sad for you.\nAnd I suppose you're in on this too. Did you make this stuff?\nI'm not saying.\nWell who's gonna clean it up?\nYou won't have to. It's gonna go from solid form directly to gas.\nWhoa! Really? What is it?\nI'm not sayin', but I can tell you it's fairly rare and very unstable.\nJust like you.\nWhy is that toy on your head?\nBecause if I wear it any place else, it chafes.\nYou see Mitch, I used to be you. And lately I've been missing me so I asked Dr. Hathaway if I could room with me again and he said sure.\nHey how's it going, Jerry?\nWhat do you want, Knight?\nWorld peace, but I don't think this is the time to discuss it.\nGet out!\nThere's something that might interest you, Jerry.\nI'm not interested in anything you have to say.\nDr. Hathaway...\nSusan!\nI solved the power problem, Jerry.\nJerry?\nTake a cab.\nSo you'll hammer later!\nDon't eat that!\nWhy?\nDon't you know that eating that stuff can give you very large breasts?\nOh, my God! I'm too late!\nDid you know there's a guy living in our closet?\nYou've seen him too?\nWho is he?\nHollyfeld.\nWhy does he keep going into our closet?\nWhy do you keep going into our closet?\nTo get my clothes - but that's not why he goes in there.\nOf course not, he's twice your size - your clothes would never fit him.\nYeah...\nThink before you ask these questions, Mitch. Twenty points higher than me? Thinks a big guy like that can wear his clothes?\nAs you know, Mitch and I were working on the cyanide system. Well, earlier today it ate itself. But, these little set-backs are just what we need to take a giant step forward. Right, Kent? Needless to say, I was a little despondent about the melt down, but then, in the midst of my preparations for hari kiri, it came to me. It is possible to synthesize excited bromide in an argon matrix. Yes, it's an excimer frozen in its excited state.\nTh... That's impossible.\nIt's a chemical laser but in solid, not gaseous, form. Put simply, in deference to you, Kent, it's like lasing a stick of dynamite. As soon as we apply a field, we couple to a state that is radiatively coupled to the ground state. I figure we can extract at least ten to the twenty-first photons per cubic centimeter which will give one kilojoule per cubic centimeter at 600 nanometers, or, one megajoule per liter.\nYou didn't touch anything, did you?\nNo.\nGood. Because all of my filth is arranged in alphabetical order. This, for instance, is under 'H' for \"toy.\"\nWhat is it?\nIt's a penis stretcher. Do you want to try it?\nNo!\nI'm just kidding. It's yet another in a long series of diversions in an attempt to avoid responsibility.\nOh, Kent, that is so unfair! And we were going to make you King of the Winter Carnival.\nReally?\nIf you want to leave, go ahead. But, uh... you're going to miss the fun.\nWhat fun?\nIck invented a new virus and we're going to release it in Kent's room.\nKent puts his name on his license plate.\nMy mom does the same thing to my underwear.\nYour mom puts license plates in your underwear? How do you sit?\nYou still run?\nOnly when chased.\nJerry, if you think that by threatening me you can get me to be your slave... Well, that's where you're right. But - and I am only saying this because I care - there are a lot of decaffeinated brands on the market today that are just as tasty as the real thing.\nI'm not kidding, Chris.\nNeither am I, Jerry.\nWould you qualify that as a launch problem or a design problem?\nIt worked!\nThat's neat!\nNow if we can just keep it from exploding!\nExplo-?\nHey Ick, you were just kidding about exploding, right?\nIck? It's a joke, right?\nYou are of no further use to me!\nInteresting way to begin a conversation...\nHe lied to us.\nIt's easy to lie to you, Mitch. You trust people. I'm a cynic.\nWelcome to Pacific Tech's \"Smart People on Ice\".\nYou unbelievable bastard.\nCount on it.\nI'm sorry. It's just that I didn't want you guys to think I was stuffy. You know, no fun. All brain, no penis.\nYou *are* Chris Knight, aren't you?\nI hope so. I'm wearing his underwear.\nHow do these look?\nTerrible - mine looks like him and his looks like me.\nUh, I'll catch up with you guys. I have to go to the bathroom.\nOkay, Kent, but I don't think that's going to help your confidence any, do you?\nIDs?\nHey, could you snap it up buddy, we just flew in, we're tired, we're hungry, we rented this stupid car...\nAre you out of your mind?\nShh. We've got to intimidate these guys. Be cool. It's okay.\nYou're not on the list.\nList. We're not on the list. Yeah, that's because we're classified.\nYeah.\nSecurity. Yes, sir.\nAren't you guys a little young to be technicians?\nYeah, well, lasers are a young science... okay, there, fine, you made me say it. Now we're both in trouble!\nLook, I'll call the duty officer.\nUh.\nHey, uh, there, uh, airborne!\nDon't do that. Listen, if you make that call it's our job: we're four hours late. Give us a break, will ya' buddy? Someday you might be in the private sector too, right?\nYeah.\nWe're dead.\nOh, no.\nAll right!\nWhat if these don't fool anybody?\nThey shoot us.\nYou wanted to see me, Your Joggingness?\nWould you prepared if gravity reversed itself? The only thing I can't figure out is how to keep the change in my pockets. I've got it. Nudity. \n\nGiven quotes from the character above, which of the following tropes would you say this character represents?\n\nA: Absent Minded Professor\nB: Adventurer Archaeologist\nC: Arrogant Kungfu Guy\nD: Big Man On Campus\nE: Bounty Hunter\nF: Brainless Beauty\nG: Broken Bird\nH: Bromantic Foil\nI: Bruiser With A Soft Center\nJ: Bully\nK: Byronic Hero\nL: Casanova\nM: Chanteuse\nN: Charmer\nO: Child Prodigy\nP: Classy Cat Burglar\nQ: Consummate Professional\nR: Corrupt Corporate Executive\nS: Coward\nT: Crazy Jealous Guy\nU: Crazy Survivalist\nV: Cultured Badass\nW: Dean Bitterman\nX: Dirty Cop\nY: Ditz\nZ: Doormat\nAA: Drill Sargeant Nasty\nAB: Dumb Blonde\nAC: Dumb Muscle\nAD: Eccentric Mentor\nAE: Egomaniac Hunter\nAF: Evil Prince\nAG: Fastest Gun In The West\nAH: Father To His Men\nAI: Final Girl\nAJ: Gadgeteer Genius\nAK: Gentleman Thief\nAL: Granola Person\nAM: Grumpy Old Man\nAN: Hardboiled Detective\nAO: Heartbroken Badass\nAP: Henpecked Husband\nAQ: Hitman With A Heart\nAR: Jerk Jock\nAS: Junkie Prophet\nAT: Klutz\nAU: Loser Protagonist\nAV: Loveable Rogue\nAW: Master Swordsman\nAX: Morally Bankrupt Banker\nAY: Officer And A Gentleman\nAZ: Ophelia\nBA: Playful Hacker\nBB: Prima Donna\nBC: Psycho For Hire\nBD: Pupil Turned To Evil\nBE: Retired Outlaw\nBF: Revenge\nBG: Romantic Runnerup\nBH: Self Made Man\nBI: Slacker\nBJ: Stoner\nBK: Storyteller\nBL: Stupid Crooks\nBM: Surfer Dude\nBN: The Chief\nBO: The Editor\nBP: Tranquil Fury\nBQ: Trickster\nBR: Valley Girl\nBS: Warrior Poet\nBT: Young Gun\n",

    "96": "No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on. You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat. You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun. And if you beat him with a gun, you better kill him, because he'll keep comin' back and back until one of you is dead.\nListen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here: the right way, the wrong way, and the way that *I* do it. You understand?\nIn Vegas, everybody's gotta watch everybody else. Since the players are looking to beat the casino, the dealers are watching the players. The box men are watching the dealers. The floor men are watching the box men. The pit bosses are watching the floor men. The shift bosses are watching the pit bosses. The casino manager is watching the shift bosses. I'm watching the casino manager. And the eye-in-the-sky is watching us all.\nWhen you love someone, you've gotta trust them. There's no other way. You've got to give them the key to everything that's yours. Otherwise, what's the point? And for a while, I believed, that's the kind of love I had.\nThe town will never be the same. After the Tangiers, the big corporations took it all over. Today it looks like Disneyland. And while the kids play cardboard pirates, Mommy and Daddy drop the house payments and Junior's college money on the poker slots. In the old days, dealers knew your name, what you drank, what you played. Today, it's like checkin' into an airport. And if you order room service, you're lucky if you get it by Thursday. Today, it's all gone. You get a whale show up with four million in a suitcase, and some twenty-five-year-old hotel school kid is gonna want his Social Security Number. After the Teamsters got knocked out of the box, the corporations tore down practically every one of the old casinos. And where did the money come from to rebuild the pyramids? Junk bonds. But in the end, I wound up right back where I started. I could still pick winners, and I could still make money for all kinds of people back home. And why mess up a good thing? And that's that.\nit wasn't long before what I was afraid what was going to happen: happened, Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas, from then on I couldn't be seen talking to him anywhere in Vegas or anywhere near it.\nso in other words: I'm fucked.\nIn so many words, yes.\nIt just didn't sink into his head what the Black Book is and what it meant, not being banned from every casino is just one thing but being this book gets you into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state, I mean you're listed in there with Al Capone, but Nicky didn't care.\nHello Mrs. Rothstein, how are you?\nYou're one of the most gorgeous women I've ever seen. You're a lucky man, Mr. Rothstein.\nThank you, thanks for that compliment.\nHe was a young kid from the casino. Nice kid, bright boy. What balls on this fuckin' kid. The next day I fired him.\nI'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands?\nNo.\nCan't do it with both hands?\nNo, sir.\nCan you do it with your left hand?\nWell, I... I never tried.\nSo you're a righty?\nYeah.\nNow you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.\nWhere the fuck do you get off talking to people about me behind my back, going over my head?\nWhat people?\nWhat people, d'ja think I wasn't gonna find out?\nI don't even know what you're talking about Nick...\nNo? You said I'm bringing heat on YOU? I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin shit? You're orderin me out? You better get your own fuckin army pal!\nI didn't do anything, I mean, I didn't order you or anybody. I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you and that was a problem.\nYou want me to get out of my own fuckin town?\nYeah I said l-let the bullshit blow over for a while, so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino it's my ass, it's not yours, it's my ass!\nOh I don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin casino because I made that possible. I'm what counts out here, not your fuckin country clubs or your fuckin TV shows! And what the fuck are you doing on TV anyhow? You know I get calls from back home every fuckin day, they think you went bat shit!\nI'm only on TV because I got to be able to hang around the casino. You understand that, you know that, come on.\nYour fuckin ass! You coulda had the food and beverage job without going on television. You wanted to go on TV.\nYeah I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum, I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown, that's right, yeah!\nYou're making a big fuckin spectacle of yourself!\nMe? I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin heat on me, I mean every time I meet somebody the big question is \"do I know you?\"\nOh sure now you wanna bring your fuckin license on me, is that it?\nNo, Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean you asked me and I know you were gonna come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told you? Do you remember what I told you?\nBack- Back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. One minute. I asked you? When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here? Get this through your head, you...\nYou never...\nGet this through your head you Jew motherfucker, you. You only exist out here because of me. That's the only reason. Without me, you, personally, every fuckin' wise guy skell around'll take a piece of your fuckin' Jew ass. Then where you gonna go? You're fuckin' warned. Don't ever go over my fuckin' head again. You motherfucker, you.\nFrom now on, I want you to put an equal amount of blueberries in each muffin.\n...An equal amount of blueberries in each muffin.\nDo you know how long that's going to take?\nI don't care how long it takes. Put an equal amount in each muffin.\nIn the casino, the cardinal rule is to keep them playing and to keep them coming back. The longer they play, the more they lose, and in the end, we get it all.\nBack home, they would have put me in jail for what I'm doing. Here, they're giving me awards.\nNow you need approval from him to go home?\nSo what? So who fucking blew you in the parking lot before you came in, huh?\nYou make me sick, you fuck. Once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.\nOh, fuck you! Fuck you, Sam Rothstein! *Fuck you*!\nNicky's methods of betting weren't scientific, but they worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. I mean, what were they going to do, muscle Nicky? Nicky was the muscle.\nThink he got the point?\nWhat are you doing? He's a square guy, for christ's sakes. You can't treat him like that. He's gonna run to the FBI.\nFuck the FBI! That prick's been dodging me for three weeks. And what is it with you? All of a sudden, you're trying to tell me what to do all the time.\nI'm not trying to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doing? Where's your head?\nWhere's my head? Where's your fucking balls? Huh? You know I'm trying to put something really big together out here. You know what I'm talking about, huh? You know! If you're acting like this now, how can I depend on you? There's a lot of things going to change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're going to have to go my fucking way.\nListen, Nick, you got to understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year going through the place. It's all over, I'm going to tell you, it's all over, if I don't get that license. And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand?\nYeah, forget about your fucking license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fucking license.\nYou know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't want to go along with me, is that it? You should say so.\nNo, I don't want to come along with you. I'll be honest with you.\nJust say so- All right, fine.\nI don't want to be involved in anything you're talking about, okay? I just want to run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it.\nYou mean, quiet like this?\n\"I'm the boss.\" That's quiet?\nThat's all taken out of context. I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened.\nWell, back home they don't know about fucking control. That looks bad.\nLooks bad? I'm going to tell you what looks bad. Every time you're on television, I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad!\nWhat the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?\nWhat happened to me? What happened to you? You lost your control.\nI lost control? Look at you! You're fucking walking around like John Barrymore! A fucking pink robe and a fucking cigarette holder? I lost control? You know, I didn't want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. Even your own wife.\nMy wife?\nYeah.\nNow, what does she have to do with all this?\nWell, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident.\nAll of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?\nNo, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fucking point. The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fucking problem.\nListen, I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.\nI can't do that.\nThe bombing was never authorized, but I suspect I know who lit the fuse. And so did the powers that be.\nWhoever it was, they put the dynamite under the passenger's side. But what they didn't know, what nobody outside the factory knew, was that that model car was made with a metal plate under the driver's seat. It's the only thing that saved my life.\nI tried to do everything I could for you, even though I knew, deep down inside, you would bury me.\nI bury you? You buried yourself.\nAce don't... listen, don't... don't make a scene, all right?\nI want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.\nShe didn't know who to turn to. She... she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin' to save your marriage.\nYeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.\nHey, be fuckin' nice. Calm. Be nice. Don't fuck up in here,\nFour reels, sevens across on three $15,000 jackpots. Do you have any idea what the odds are?\nShoot, it's gotta be in the millions, maybe more.\nThree fuckin' jackpots in 20 minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?\nWell, it happened so quick, 3 guys won; I didn't have a chance...\nYou didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was going on?\nWell, there's no way to determine that...\nYes there is! An infallible way, they won!\nWell, it's a casino! People gotta win sometimes.\nWard, you're pissing me off. Now you're insulting my intelligence; what you think I am, a fuckin' idiot? You know goddamn well that someone had to get into those machines and set those fuckin' reels. The probability of one four-reel machine is a million and a half to one; the probability of three machines in a row; it's in the billions! It cannot happen, would not happen, you fuckin' momo! What's the matter with you? Didn't you see you were being set up on the second win?\nI really think...\nWait! You didn't see that you were being set up on the second win?\nI really think you're overreacting...\nListen, you fuckin' yokel, I've had it with you. I've been carrying your ass in this place ever since I got here. Get your ass and get your things and get out of here.\nYou're firing me?\nI'm firing you. No, I'm not firing, I'm firing you, ya...\nYou might regret this, Mr. Rothstein.\nI'll regret it even more if I keep you on.\nThis is not the way to treat people.\nListen, if you didn't know you were being scammed you're too fuckin' dumb to keep this job, if you did know, you were in on it. Either way, YOU'RE OUT! Get out. Go on, let's go.\nYou come down here right now! Get down here and talk to me, goddamn it! Don't fucking ignore me, you motherfucker! I mean it! You come down here right now! Get down here and talk to me, goddamn it! Fuck you! Goddamn you, come out here! I'm gonna drive your fucking car through the living room! You fucking coward! You motherfucker, you! Come out here and talk to me, you fucker!\nWill you stop it? You're drunk, you're on drugs.\nI am not!\nYou're gonna be sorry if you don't stop it! The whole neighborhood...\nDon't you threaten me! Don't you threaten me! You are not threatening me anymore! You fuck! You fuck! I'm sick of you! I AM fucking Nicky Santoro! I am! He's my new sponsor! How about that, you fuckhead?\nWhat are you looking at? Fuck off!\nYou fucking mo-mo, what's the matter with you?\nThe Feds were watching Nicky play golf for so long that they ran out of gas. Just what I needed, right in front of the control board.\nA hundred dollars to whoever hits the plane.\nThis is the end result of all the bright lights, and the comp trips, and all the champagne, and free hotel suites, and all the broads and all the booze. It's all been arranged just for us to get *your money*.\nAre you out of your fucking mind? You tie up our kid and lock the fucking door? Are you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fucking mind?\nIt was just for a little while, Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there.\nI ought to fucking have you committed. You fucking do that again, I'll...\nI was just gonna be out for a little while. She was asleep. I was gonna be right back before she even woke up.\nListen. Listen, you fucking cunt. Listen to me.\nFuck you. I was gonna be back before she woke up.\nListen to me. Listen carefully. You ever touch her again, you ever do anything like that again, I'll fucking kill ya, pure and simple. You hear me? Pure and fuckin' simple.\nWhy don't you just let me go, Sam?\nI'll fucking kill you. You fucking whore.\nI'll sign anything you want me to sign. I just want the key to my jewelry, and I want you to let me go.\nYou want your jewelry?\nI want you to let me go.\nAnd let you disgrace me, you fucking pig? Let you disgrace me? Get up and be a mother. Get in the car and go to the house right now. Get up and get in the... get... get up. Get up!\nI wouldn't do that if I were you. I wouldn't do that...\nGet the fuck... are you threatening me? I'll fucking kill you in this place. Get up and go home.\nI'm going! I'm going!\nSure enough, an hour later, I get the call.\nAce, what happened over there? I mean, did you know that guy you threw out was with me?\nNo, I didn't know that. But you know what he did? He insulted Billy. And then I walked over to him politely and he tells me to go fuck myself. Then he called me a faggot.\nWhat?\nSo what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.\nWhat? Hold on a second.\nHey, come here.\n\nYou called my friend a faggot? You tell him to go fuck himself?\nNicky, I didn't\nIs that what you did?\nI did. I didn't\nTell him to go fuck himself? You fucking hick! Fucking.\nyou big fucking hick, you. Come here. Come here.\nGet him up. Come here.\n\nYou go over there right now and you apologize. You better hope he lets you back in. If you ever get out of line over there again, I'll smash your fucking head so hard you won't be able to get that cowboy hat on. You hear me? Fucking hick.\nAce, listen to me. this guy obviously doesn't know who he was talking to, you understand? He doesn't know that, uh, we're dear friends. I mean, he's already very sorry. But, uh, if you could do me a favor to let him back in, I swear to you he'll never get out of line again. I promise you that.\nIf he does it again, he's out for good. I don't care what it is, Nick, I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let him in the place again.\nI'm sorry about this. Really. All right, Ace?\nOkay.\nThanks, pal.\nYou took your boots off? You put your feet on the table... you shit-kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smelling motherfucker you! You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the fucking desert! You understand?\nGo over there and apologize.\nGo! Get the fuck over there!\nYou guys have to be kidding, adjourned? What do you mean adjourned? Mr. Chairman, Senator. You promised me a hearing, you won't allow me a hearing? You didn't even look at the FBI reports. When you were my guest, Mr. Chairman, Senator, at the Tangiers hotel, did you not promise me that I would have a fair hearing?\nI was never... I was never your guest at the Tangiers...\nYou were never my guest?\n...that's right.\nI never comped you? I don't comp you at least 2 or 3 times a month? At the Tangiers?\nI... I'd like to answer that at this time, Mr. Rothstein is being very typical to this point. He's lying. The only time I was at the Tangiers was when I had dinner with Barney Greenstein.\nWas I at that dinner? Tell me, was I at that dinner?\nYou were wandering.\nWas I at that dinner? Was I?\nYou were wandering around. You were in the... you were in the building.\nI was in the building? You know damn well I was at that dinner, and you swore to me I would have a fair hearing. Did you not? Did you not? Well, tell me I was at least at the dinner. Allow me that much. Give me that much at least!\nYes, you were.\nYeah. Thanks for not calling me a liar. You son of a bitch.\nAnd this... this is how she backed him off.\nAre we certain that you want the gamin' control board eyeballing your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?\nI think you're way out of line talking to me like that. What your saying is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise.\nNormally, my prospects of coming back alive from a meeting with Nicky were 99 out of 100. But this time, when I heard him say \"a couple of hundred yards down the road\", I gave myself 50-50.\nThey had enough of Nicky. They had enough. I mean, how much more were they gonna take? So, they made an example of him and his brother: they buried them while they were still breathing.\nThe guy is history as far as I'm concerned. History.\nYou can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner.\nSo what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it.\nFor Nicky, Las Vegas was the fucking wild west.\nListen, I gotta meet Clean Face right away, what about the Chez Paris?\nI gotta meet Charlie the Banker right away at your house, OK?\nNo, you can't, you gotta make a reservation, it's all booked up.\nNo no, it's ok.\nIt's impossible, it's booked up, you gotta make a reservation, it's very difficult to get in.\nI don't want a meeting at my house.\nIt's ok, I'll use the service entrance. I'll see you at nine.\nI'll come in from the golf course side. See you at six.\nBefore I ever ran a casino or got myself blown up, Ace Rothstein was a helluva handicapper, I can tell you that. I was so good that when I bet, I can change the odds for every bookmaker in the country. I'm serious. I had it down so cold that I was given paradise on earth. I was given one of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas to run: The Tangiers, by the only kind of guys that can get you that kind of money. Sixty-two million seven hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details.\nMatter of fact, nobody knew all the details. But it should have been perfect. I mean he had me, Nicky Santoro, his best friend watching his ass. And he had Ginger, the woman he loved on his arm. But in the end, we fucked it all up. It should have been so sweet, too. But it turned out to be the last time that street guys like us were ever given anything that fuckin' valuable again.\nI don't give a shit who he's connected to. Tell him to take his fuckin' feet off the table. What's he think this is, a goddamn sawdust joint?\nSir, would you mind taking your feet off the table and putting your shoes back on?\nYeah, I would mind. I'm having a bad night.\nFuckin' asshole won't budge.\nCall security.\nHow are you?\nGood. How are you?\nFine. Good. You want to do me a favor? You want to take your feet off the table and put your shoes back on?\nFuck you!\n\n\nI want you vacate this guy off the premises, and I want you to exit him off his feet and use his head to open the fucking door.\nSir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside?\nBullshit, I ain't going anywhere.\nBullshit, you're coming with us!\nFuck you! FUCK YOU! You know who you're fucking with? Huh? Do you? You fucking faggot! Do you know who you're fucking with?\nHere we go!\nI don't believe this!\n\nA routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino executive, Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein accused the state's top gaming officials of corruption and hypocrisy.\nWhat are you runnin' for, Bob? What are you running for? Don't you remember? You promised me a fair hearing when you were getting comped at my hotel, and you were asking me for copies of your bills so you could put 'em on your expense account!\nIn a wild outburst that followed his gaming license denial, Rothstein followed several stunned commissioners into the hallway where he continued his harangue until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.\nBullshit! Bullshit! We all have a past. You have a past. I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me!\nLong suspected of running the Tangiers without a license, yesterday's hearing was to determine whether someone with Rothstein's history was qualified to officially hold a top gaming post.\nFuckin' hypocrites!\nOkay, I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.\nWho were you with?\nI was with someone.\nI know you were with someone, who were you with?\nI just hope it's not someone who I think it might be. I just hope it's not them.\nWe had a deal, remember? He said if things didn't work out, I could take my stuff and my daughter and leave.\nLook in my eyes. Look - look in my eyes. You know me. Do you see anything in these eyes that would let someone in your condition take my child away from me? You know that'll never happen.\nWould you knock it off, Sam?\nI'm just trying to figure it out.\nNothing to figure out. I'm home, we're working it out.\nYeah, but I've been told before we're working it out. To think that you're home...\nafter what you just put me through with Amy... is a favor to me?\nSo counting the watch, maybe four thousand for expenses over the weekends, of which you must have had a good time. I know he did. That's for sure. I know that fucking peice of shit had a good fucking time. On my money. You might as well have fucked him, which you probably did anyway. You looking me a certain way. You're teary-eyed. I get it. You're good actress, you know that? Good fucking actress. Can't fucking get that pity out of people. I'm no john. You understand? You always thought I was but I'm not. I'm no sucker. Fucking pimp cocksucker. He's lucky I didn't kill him last time. Lucky he's fucking living. And if you had stayed with him, and you would have run away, you would have been dead, both of you. Dead! Dead!\nYou know, I don't know if I could do this even if I wanted to. The Gaming Commission would never give me a license. I have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.\nYou don't have to have a license to work in a casino. All you gotta do is apply for one. The state law says you can work in a casino while they're processing your application. They got a ten-year backlog.\nBut what happens when they do find out?\nWhy would they want to find out? We're putting a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out? And besides, they'll never find out. All you got to do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens is they take your application and they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys working there for thirty years who don't have a license.\nIt's a tough proposition, Andy. You know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way.\nYou got it.\nI'm serious. No interference.\nNobody's going to interfere with you running the casino. I guarantee it.\nIn the casino, the cardinal rule is to keep them playing and keep them coming back. The longer they play, the more they lose. In the end, we get it all.\nBack home, they would have put me in jail for what I'm doing. But out here, they're givin' me awards.\nAnd what happens next? I can't believe it. Who the hell would believe that the FBI had a wire in the place looking for some information about some old homicide about some guy who was whacked out God knows when over God knows what. Would you believe such a thing could happen? Every FBI man across the country had their ears open, this guy basically sunk the whole world.\nGreedy bitch!\nI don't give a shit who he's connected to. Tell him to take his fuckin' feet off the table. What's he think this is, a goddamn sawdust joint?\nYou tied up our little daughter to a bed? What the fuck is the matter with you? Is there something mentally wrong with you?\nIt was only for a couple hours Sam... the babysitter wasn't around, so I did what I could.\nI want you to exit this guy off the premises, I want you to exit him off his feet and I want you to use his head to open the fucking door.\nIf you ever come back again, ever, to take her money, next time bring a pistol. That way you've got a chance.\nNow here's this guy reading the dealer's whole card and signaling his buddy at this table.\nAnd that's just what these hustlers look for. They cruise from casino to casino, looking for weak dealers the way lions look for weak antelope.\nThey never know what hit them. And if, and when, they do find out that they just got zapped by a cattle prod, they wish they really did have a heart attack.\nFrom now on, I want you to put an equal amount of blueberries in each muffin.\nAn equal amount of blueberries in each muffin.\nDo you know how long that's going to take?\nI don't care how long it takes, put an equal amount in each muffin.\nBut one thing I could just never understand was how she could have everything under control but her old pimp Lester Diamond.\nLook, Gin, you know I got other people in this. I got partners. But I want you to understand that I am lookin' out for you in this thing. Okay? You're going to get yours back... and you're gonna get it back first. Okay?\nAll right.\nOkay?\nYeah.\nWhere are you goin'? Where are you? You're in that place. Where are you?\nI'm here.\nNo, you're not. Where are you? Where are you?\nI'm always here for you.\nYou are.\nI am.\n. Be careful.\nThe Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep.\nAnd that's that.\nLook what they did to my hand man!\nAll right, I'm gonna give you a choice. You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here. You can't have both. What do you want?\nI just wanna get outta here.\nAnd don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck up around here. You understand?\nI'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.\nYou're fuckin' right you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here, if we catch either one of ya, we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw? We're gonna use it. We don't fuck around in this place. You got it? Get outta here.\nThank you.\nThrow him out into the alley and just tell the cops he got hit by a car.\nI have a large family.\nHow many kids do you have?\nI'm very proud to say that we have eight children.\nThat's amazing.\nNo, no, please. Please. There's nothing to it, heh. It was my pleasure.\nNo matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on. You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat. You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun. And if you beat him with a gun, you better kill him, because he'll keep comin' back and back until one of you is dead.\nListen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here: the right way, the wrong way, and the way that *I* do it. You understand?\nIn Vegas, everybody's gotta watch everybody else. Since the players are looking to beat the casino, the dealers are watching the players. The box men are watching the dealers. The floor men are watching the box men. The pit bosses are watching the floor men. The shift bosses are watching the pit bosses. The casino manager is watching the shift bosses. I'm watching the casino manager. And the eye-in-the-sky is watching us all.\nWhen you love someone, you've gotta trust them. There's no other way. You've got to give them the key to everything that's yours. Otherwise, what's the point? And for a while, I believed, that's the kind of love I had.\nThe town will never be the same. After the Tangiers, the big corporations took it all over. Today it looks like Disneyland. And while the kids play cardboard pirates, Mommy and Daddy drop the house payments and Junior's college money on the poker slots. In the old days, dealers knew your name, what you drank, what you played. Today, it's like checkin' into an airport. And if you order room service, you're lucky if you get it by Thursday. Today, it's all gone. You get a whale show up with four million in a suitcase, and some twenty-five-year-old hotel school kid is gonna want his Social Security Number. After the Teamsters got knocked out of the box, the corporations tore down practically every one of the old casinos. And where did the money come from to rebuild the pyramids? Junk bonds. But in the end, I wound up right back where I started. I could still pick winners, and I could still make money for all kinds of people back home. And why mess up a good thing? And that's that.\nit wasn't long before what I was afraid what was going to happen: happened, Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas, from then on I couldn't be seen talking to him anywhere in Vegas or anywhere near it.\nso in other words: I'm fucked.\nIn so many words, yes.\nIt just didn't sink into his head what the Black Book is and what it meant, not being banned from every casino is just one thing but being this book gets you into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state, I mean you're listed in there with Al Capone, but Nicky didn't care.\nHello Mrs. Rothstein, how are you?\nYou're one of the most gorgeous women I've ever seen. You're a lucky man, Mr. Rothstein.\nThank you, thanks for that compliment.\nHe was a young kid from the casino. Nice kid, bright boy. What balls on this fuckin' kid. The next day I fired him.\nI'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands?\nNo.\nCan't do it with both hands?\nNo, sir.\nCan you do it with your left hand?\nWell, I... I never tried.\nSo you're a righty?\nYeah.\nNow you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.\nWhere the fuck do you get off talking to people about me behind my back, going over my head?\nWhat people?\nWhat people, d'ja think I wasn't gonna find out?\nI don't even know what you're talking about Nick...\nNo? You said I'm bringing heat on YOU? I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin shit? You're orderin me out? You better get your own fuckin army pal!\nI didn't do anything, I mean, I didn't order you or anybody. I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you and that was a problem.\nYou want me to get out of my own fuckin town?\nYeah I said l-let the bullshit blow over for a while, so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino it's my ass, it's not yours, it's my ass!\nOh I don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin casino because I made that possible. I'm what counts out here, not your fuckin country clubs or your fuckin TV shows! And what the fuck are you doing on TV anyhow? You know I get calls from back home every fuckin day, they think you went bat shit!\nI'm only on TV because I got to be able to hang around the casino. You understand that, you know that, come on.\nYour fuckin ass! You coulda had the food and beverage job without going on television. You wanted to go on TV.\nYeah I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum, I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown, that's right, yeah!\nYou're making a big fuckin spectacle of yourself!\nMe? I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin heat on me, I mean every time I meet somebody the big question is \"do I know you?\"\nOh sure now you wanna bring your fuckin license on me, is that it?\nNo, Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean you asked me and I know you were gonna come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told you? Do you remember what I told you?\nBack- Back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. One minute. I asked you? When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here? Get this through your head, you...\nYou never...\nGet this through your head you Jew motherfucker, you. You only exist out here because of me. That's the only reason. Without me, you, personally, every fuckin' wise guy skell around'll take a piece of your fuckin' Jew ass. Then where you gonna go? You're fuckin' warned. Don't ever go over my fuckin' head again. You motherfucker, you.\nFrom now on, I want you to put an equal amount of blueberries in each muffin.\n...An equal amount of blueberries in each muffin.\nDo you know how long that's going to take?\nI don't care how long it takes. Put an equal amount in each muffin.\nIn the casino, the cardinal rule is to keep them playing and to keep them coming back. The longer they play, the more they lose, and in the end, we get it all.\nBack home, they would have put me in jail for what I'm doing. Here, they're giving me awards.\nNow you need approval from him to go home?\nSo what? So who fucking blew you in the parking lot before you came in, huh?\nYou make me sick, you fuck. Once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.\nOh, fuck you! Fuck you, Sam Rothstein! *Fuck you*!\nNicky's methods of betting weren't scientific, but they worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. I mean, what were they going to do, muscle Nicky? Nicky was the muscle.\nThink he got the point?\nWhat are you doing? He's a square guy, for christ's sakes. You can't treat him like that. He's gonna run to the FBI.\nFuck the FBI! That prick's been dodging me for three weeks. And what is it with you? All of a sudden, you're trying to tell me what to do all the time.\nI'm not trying to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doing? Where's your head?\nWhere's my head? Where's your fucking balls? Huh? You know I'm trying to put something really big together out here. You know what I'm talking about, huh? You know! If you're acting like this now, how can I depend on you? There's a lot of things going to change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're going to have to go my fucking way.\nListen, Nick, you got to understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year going through the place. It's all over, I'm going to tell you, it's all over, if I don't get that license. And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand?\nYeah, forget about your fucking license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fucking license.\nYou know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't want to go along with me, is that it? You should say so.\nNo, I don't want to come along with you. I'll be honest with you.\nJust say so- All right, fine.\nI don't want to be involved in anything you're talking about, okay? I just want to run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it.\nYou mean, quiet like this?\n\"I'm the boss.\" That's quiet?\nThat's all taken out of context. I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened.\nWell, back home they don't know about fucking control. That looks bad.\nLooks bad? I'm going to tell you what looks bad. Every time you're on television, I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad!\nWhat the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?\nWhat happened to me? What happened to you? You lost your control.\nI lost control? Look at you! You're fucking walking around like John Barrymore! A fucking pink robe and a fucking cigarette holder? I lost control? You know, I didn't want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. Even your own wife.\nMy wife?\nYeah.\nNow, what does she have to do with all this?\nWell, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident.\nAll of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?\nNo, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fucking point. The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fucking problem.\nListen, I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.\nI can't do that.\nThe bombing was never authorized, but I suspect I know who lit the fuse. And so did the powers that be.\nWhoever it was, they put the dynamite under the passenger's side. But what they didn't know, what nobody outside the factory knew, was that that model car was made with a metal plate under the driver's seat. It's the only thing that saved my life.\nI tried to do everything I could for you, even though I knew, deep down inside, you would bury me.\nI bury you? You buried yourself.\nAce don't... listen, don't... don't make a scene, all right?\nI want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.\nShe didn't know who to turn to. She... she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin' to save your marriage.\nYeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.\nHey, be fuckin' nice. Calm. Be nice. Don't fuck up in here,\nFour reels, sevens across on three $15,000 jackpots. Do you have any idea what the odds are?\nShoot, it's gotta be in the millions, maybe more.\nThree fuckin' jackpots in 20 minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?\nWell, it happened so quick, 3 guys won; I didn't have a chance...\nYou didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was going on?\nWell, there's no way to determine that...\nYes there is! An infallible way, they won!\nWell, it's a casino! People gotta win sometimes.\nWard, you're pissing me off. Now you're insulting my intelligence; what you think I am, a fuckin' idiot? You know goddamn well that someone had to get into those machines and set those fuckin' reels. The probability of one four-reel machine is a million and a half to one; the probability of three machines in a row; it's in the billions! It cannot happen, would not happen, you fuckin' momo! What's the matter with you? Didn't you see you were being set up on the second win?\nI really think...\nWait! You didn't see that you were being set up on the second win?\nI really think you're overreacting...\nListen, you fuckin' yokel, I've had it with you. I've been carrying your ass in this place ever since I got here. Get your ass and get your things and get out of here.\nYou're firing me?\nI'm firing you. No, I'm not firing, I'm firing you, ya...\nYou might regret this, Mr. Rothstein.\nI'll regret it even more if I keep you on.\nThis is not the way to treat people.\nListen, if you didn't know you were being scammed you're too fuckin' dumb to keep this job, if you did know, you were in on it. Either way, YOU'RE OUT! Get out. Go on, let's go.\nYou come down here right now! Get down here and talk to me, goddamn it! Don't fucking ignore me, you motherfucker! I mean it! You come down here right now! Get down here and talk to me, goddamn it! Fuck you! Goddamn you, come out here! I'm gonna drive your fucking car through the living room! You fucking coward! You motherfucker, you! Come out here and talk to me, you fucker!\nWill you stop it? You're drunk, you're on drugs.\nI am not!\nYou're gonna be sorry if you don't stop it! The whole neighborhood...\nDon't you threaten me! Don't you threaten me! You are not threatening me anymore! You fuck! You fuck! I'm sick of you! I AM fucking Nicky Santoro! I am! He's my new sponsor! How about that, you fuckhead?\nWhat are you looking at? Fuck off!\nYou fucking mo-mo, what's the matter with you?\nThe Feds were watching Nicky play golf for so long that they ran out of gas. Just what I needed, right in front of the control board.\nA hundred dollars to whoever hits the plane.\nThis is the end result of all the bright lights, and the comp trips, and all the champagne, and free hotel suites, and all the broads and all the booze. It's all been arranged just for us to get *your money*.\nAre you out of your fucking mind? You tie up our kid and lock the fucking door? Are you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fucking mind?\nIt was just for a little while, Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there.\nI ought to fucking have you committed. You fucking do that again, I'll...\nI was just gonna be out for a little while. She was asleep. I was gonna be right back before she even woke up.\nListen. Listen, you fucking cunt. Listen to me.\nFuck you. I was gonna be back before she woke up.\nListen to me. Listen carefully. You ever touch her again, you ever do anything like that again, I'll fucking kill ya, pure and simple. You hear me? Pure and fuckin' simple.\nWhy don't you just let me go, Sam?\nI'll fucking kill you. You fucking whore.\nI'll sign anything you want me to sign. I just want the key to my jewelry, and I want you to let me go.\nYou want your jewelry?\nI want you to let me go.\nAnd let you disgrace me, you fucking pig? Let you disgrace me? Get up and be a mother. Get in the car and go to the house right now. Get up and get in the... get... get up. Get up!\nI wouldn't do that if I were you. I wouldn't do that...\nGet the fuck... are you threatening me? I'll fucking kill you in this place. Get up and go home.\nI'm going! I'm going!\nSure enough, an hour later, I get the call.\nAce, what happened over there? I mean, did you know that guy you threw out was with me?\nNo, I didn't know that. But you know what he did? He insulted Billy. And then I walked over to him politely and he tells me to go fuck myself. Then he called me a faggot.\nWhat?\nSo what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.\nWhat? Hold on a second.\nHey, come here.\n\nYou called my friend a faggot? You tell him to go fuck himself?\nNicky, I didn't\nIs that what you did?\nI did. I didn't\nTell him to go fuck himself? You fucking hick! Fucking.\nyou big fucking hick, you. Come here. Come here.\nGet him up. Come here.\n\nYou go over there right now and you apologize. You better hope he lets you back in. If you ever get out of line over there again, I'll smash your fucking head so hard you won't be able to get that cowboy hat on. You hear me? Fucking hick.\nAce, listen to me. this guy obviously doesn't know who he was talking to, you understand? He doesn't know that, uh, we're dear friends. I mean, he's already very sorry. But, uh, if you could do me a favor to let him back in, I swear to you he'll never get out of line again. I promise you that.\nIf he does it again, he's out for good. I don't care what it is, Nick, I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let him in the place again.\nI'm sorry about this. Really. All right, Ace?\nOkay.\nThanks, pal.\nYou took your boots off? You put your feet on the table... you shit-kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smelling motherfucker you! You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the fucking desert! You understand?\nGo over there and apologize.\nGo! Get the fuck over there!\nYou guys have to be kidding, adjourned? What do you mean adjourned? Mr. Chairman, Senator. You promised me a hearing, you won't allow me a hearing? You didn't even look at the FBI reports. When you were my guest, Mr. Chairman, Senator, at the Tangiers hotel, did you not promise me that I would have a fair hearing?\nI was never... I was never your guest at the Tangiers...\nYou were never my guest?\n...that's right.\nI never comped you? I don't comp you at least 2 or 3 times a month? At the Tangiers?\nI... I'd like to answer that at this time, Mr. Rothstein is being very typical to this point. He's lying. The only time I was at the Tangiers was when I had dinner with Barney Greenstein.\nWas I at that dinner? Tell me, was I at that dinner?\nYou were wandering.\nWas I at that dinner? Was I?\nYou were wandering around. You were in the... you were in the building.\nI was in the building? You know damn well I was at that dinner, and you swore to me I would have a fair hearing. Did you not? Did you not? Well, tell me I was at least at the dinner. Allow me that much. Give me that much at least!\nYes, you were.\nYeah. Thanks for not calling me a liar. You son of a bitch.\nAnd this... this is how she backed him off.\nAre we certain that you want the gamin' control board eyeballing your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?\nI think you're way out of line talking to me like that. What your saying is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise.\nNormally, my prospects of coming back alive from a meeting with Nicky were 99 out of 100. But this time, when I heard him say \"a couple of hundred yards down the road\", I gave myself 50-50.\nThey had enough of Nicky. They had enough. I mean, how much more were they gonna take? So, they made an example of him and his brother: they buried them while they were still breathing.\nThe guy is history as far as I'm concerned. History.\nYou can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner.\nSo what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it.\nFor Nicky, Las Vegas was the fucking wild west.\nListen, I gotta meet Clean Face right away, what about the Chez Paris?\nI gotta meet Charlie the Banker right away at your house, OK?\nNo, you can't, you gotta make a reservation, it's all booked up.\nNo no, it's ok.\nIt's impossible, it's booked up, you gotta make a reservation, it's very difficult to get in.\nI don't want a meeting at my house.\nIt's ok, I'll use the service entrance. I'll see you at nine.\nI'll come in from the golf course side. See you at six.\nBefore I ever ran a casino or got myself blown up, Ace Rothstein was a helluva handicapper, I can tell you that. I was so good that when I bet, I can change the odds for every bookmaker in the country. I'm serious. I had it down so cold that I was given paradise on earth. I was given one of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas to run: The Tangiers, by the only kind of guys that can get you that kind of money. Sixty-two million seven hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details.\nMatter of fact, nobody knew all the details. But it should have been perfect. I mean he had me, Nicky Santoro, his best friend watching his ass. And he had Ginger, the woman he loved on his arm. But in the end, we fucked it all up. It should have been so sweet, too. But it turned out to be the last time that street guys like us were ever given anything that fuckin' valuable again.\nI don't give a shit who he's connected to. Tell him to take his fuckin' feet off the table. What's he think this is, a goddamn sawdust joint?\nSir, would you mind taking your feet off the table and putting your shoes back on?\nYeah, I would mind. I'm having a bad night.\nFuckin' asshole won't budge.\nCall security.\nHow are you?\nGood. How are you?\nFine. Good. You want to do me a favor? You want to take your feet off the table and put your shoes back on?\nFuck you!\n\n\nI want you vacate this guy off the premises, and I want you to exit him off his feet and use his head to open the fucking door.\nSir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside?\nBullshit, I ain't going anywhere.\nBullshit, you're coming with us!\nFuck you! FUCK YOU! You know who you're fucking with? Huh? Do you? You fucking faggot! Do you know who you're fucking with?\nHere we go!\nI don't believe this!\n\nA routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino executive, Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein accused the state's top gaming officials of corruption and hypocrisy.\nWhat are you runnin' for, Bob? What are you running for? Don't you remember? You promised me a fair hearing when you were getting comped at my hotel, and you were asking me for copies of your bills so you could put 'em on your expense account!\nIn a wild outburst that followed his gaming license denial, Rothstein followed several stunned commissioners into the hallway where he continued his harangue until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.\nBullshit! Bullshit! We all have a past. You have a past. I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me!\nLong suspected of running the Tangiers without a license, yesterday's hearing was to determine whether someone with Rothstein's history was qualified to officially hold a top gaming post.\nFuckin' hypocrites!\nOkay, I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.\nWho were you with?\nI was with someone.\nI know you were with someone, who were you with?\nI just hope it's not someone who I think it might be. I just hope it's not them.\nWe had a deal, remember? He said if things didn't work out, I could take my stuff and my daughter and leave.\nLook in my eyes. Look - look in my eyes. You know me. Do you see anything in these eyes that would let someone in your condition take my child away from me? You know that'll never happen.\nWould you knock it off, Sam?\nI'm just trying to figure it out.\nNothing to figure out. I'm home, we're working it out.\nYeah, but I've been told before we're working it out. To think that you're home...\nafter what you just put me through with Amy... is a favor to me?\nSo counting the watch, maybe four thousand for expenses over the weekends, of which you must have had a good time. I know he did. That's for sure. I know that fucking peice of shit had a good fucking time. On my money. You might as well have fucked him, which you probably did anyway. You looking me a certain way. You're teary-eyed. I get it. You're good actress, you know that? Good fucking actress. Can't fucking get that pity out of people. I'm no john. You understand? You always thought I was but I'm not. I'm no sucker. Fucking pimp cocksucker. He's lucky I didn't kill him last time. Lucky he's fucking living. And if you had stayed with him, and you would have run away, you would have been dead, both of you. Dead! Dead!\nYou know, I don't know if I could do this even if I wanted to. The Gaming Commission would never give me a license. I have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.\nYou don't have to have a license to work in a casino. All you gotta do is apply for one. The state law says you can work in a casino while they're processing your application. They got a ten-year backlog.\nBut what happens when they do find out?\nWhy would they want to find out? We're putting a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out? And besides, they'll never find out. All you got to do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens is they take your application and they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys working there for thirty years who don't have a license.\nIt's a tough proposition, Andy. You know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way.\nYou got it.\nI'm serious. No interference.\nNobody's going to interfere with you running the casino. I guarantee it.\nIn the casino, the cardinal rule is to keep them playing and keep them coming back. The longer they play, the more they lose. In the end, we get it all.\nBack home, they would have put me in jail for what I'm doing. But out here, they're givin' me awards.\nAnd what happens next? I can't believe it. Who the hell would believe that the FBI had a wire in the place looking for some information about some old homicide about some guy who was whacked out God knows when over God knows what. Would you believe such a thing could happen? Every FBI man across the country had their ears open, this guy basically sunk the whole world.\nGreedy bitch!\nI don't give a shit who he's connected to. Tell him to take his fuckin' feet off the table. What's he think this is, a goddamn sawdust joint?\nYou tied up our little daughter to a bed? What the fuck is the matter with you? Is there something mentally wrong with you?\nIt was only for a couple hours Sam... the babysitter wasn't around, so I did what I could.\nI want you to exit this guy off the premises, I want you to exit him off his feet and I want you to use his head to open the fucking door.\nIf you ever come back again, ever, to take her money, next time bring a pistol. That way you've got a chance.\nNow here's this guy reading the dealer's whole card and signaling his buddy at this table.\nAnd that's just what these hustlers look for. They cruise from casino to casino, looking for weak dealers the way lions look for weak antelope.\nThey never know what hit them. And if, and when, they do find out that they just got zapped by a cattle prod, they wish they really did have a heart attack.\nFrom now on, I want you to put an equal amount of blueberries in each muffin.\nAn equal amount of blueberries in each muffin.\nDo you know how long that's going to take?\nI don't care how long it takes, put an equal amount in each muffin.\nBut one thing I could just never understand was how she could have everything under control but her old pimp Lester Diamond.\nLook, Gin, you know I got other people in this. I got partners. But I want you to understand that I am lookin' out for you in this thing. Okay? You're going to get yours back... and you're gonna get it back first. Okay?\nAll right.\nOkay?\nYeah.\nWhere are you goin'? Where are you? You're in that place. Where are you?\nI'm here.\nNo, you're not. Where are you? Where are you?\nI'm always here for you.\nYou are.\nI am.\n. Be careful.\nThe Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep.\nAnd that's that.\nLook what they did to my hand man!\nAll right, I'm gonna give you a choice. You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here. You can't have both. What do you want?\nI just wanna get outta here.\nAnd don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck up around here. You understand?\nI'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.\nYou're fuckin' right you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here, if we catch either one of ya, we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw? We're gonna use it. We don't fuck around in this place. You got it? Get outta here.\nThank you.\nThrow him out into the alley and just tell the cops he got hit by a car.\nI have a large family.\nHow many kids do you have?\nI'm very proud to say that we have eight children.\nThat's amazing.\nNo, no, please. Please. There's nothing to it, heh. It was my pleasure. \n\nGiven quotes from the character above, which of the following tropes would you say this character represents?\n\nA: Absent Minded Professor\nB: Adventurer Archaeologist\nC: Arrogant Kungfu Guy\nD: Big Man On Campus\nE: Bounty Hunter\nF: Brainless Beauty\nG: Broken Bird\nH: Bromantic Foil\nI: Bruiser With A Soft Center\nJ: Bully\nK: Byronic Hero\nL: Casanova\nM: Chanteuse\nN: Charmer\nO: Child Prodigy\nP: Classy Cat Burglar\nQ: Consummate Professional\nR: Corrupt Corporate Executive\nS: Coward\nT: Crazy Jealous Guy\nU: Crazy Survivalist\nV: Cultured Badass\nW: Dean Bitterman\nX: Dirty Cop\nY: Ditz\nZ: Doormat\nAA: Drill Sargeant Nasty\nAB: Dumb Blonde\nAC: Dumb Muscle\nAD: Eccentric Mentor\nAE: Egomaniac Hunter\nAF: Evil Prince\nAG: Fastest Gun In The West\nAH: Father To His Men\nAI: Final Girl\nAJ: Gadgeteer Genius\nAK: Gentleman Thief\nAL: Granola Person\nAM: Grumpy Old Man\nAN: Hardboiled Detective\nAO: Heartbroken Badass\nAP: Henpecked Husband\nAQ: Hitman With A Heart\nAR: Jerk Jock\nAS: Junkie Prophet\nAT: Klutz\nAU: Loser Protagonist\nAV: Loveable Rogue\nAW: Master Swordsman\nAX: Morally Bankrupt Banker\nAY: Officer And A Gentleman\nAZ: Ophelia\nBA: Playful Hacker\nBB: Prima Donna\nBC: Psycho For Hire\nBD: Pupil Turned To Evil\nBE: Retired Outlaw\nBF: Revenge\nBG: Romantic Runnerup\nBH: Self Made Man\nBI: Slacker\nBJ: Stoner\nBK: Storyteller\nBL: Stupid Crooks\nBM: Surfer Dude\nBN: The Chief\nBO: The Editor\nBP: Tranquil Fury\nBQ: Trickster\nBR: Valley Girl\nBS: Warrior Poet\nBT: Young Gun\n",

We both come a long way since college. You, not so much. I wanted to like that song, but, you heard it... not that good. If I wasn't your friend, I'd say, \"Dave, you go right back out of this office and you keep writing music, you'll get there someday.\" But I am your friend, so I'm going to tell you that there is no sense in writing songs that no one is ever, ever, going to sing.\nEver?\nUncle Ian?\nWhat are you doing here?\nCan I sleep with you?

    "98": "George, I am an old man, and most people hate me. But I don't like them either so that makes it all even.\nLook at you. You used to be so cocky. You were going to go out and conquer the world. You once called me \"a warped, frustrated, old man\"! What are you but a warped, frustrated young man? A miserable little clerk crawling in here on your hands and knees and begging for help. No securities, no stocks, no bonds, nothin' but a miserable little $500 equity in a life insurance policy.\nYou're worth more dead than alive! Why don't you go to the riffraff you love so much and ask them to let you have $8,000? You know why? Because they'd run you out of town on a rail. But I'll tell you what I'm going to do for you, George. Since the state examiner is still here, as a stockholder of the Building and Loan, I'm going to swear out a warrant for your arrest. Misappropriation of funds, manipulation, malfeasance...\nAll right, George, go ahead! You can't hide in a little town like this!\nMerry Christmas, Mr. Potter!\nAnd Happy New Year to you, in jail! Why don't you go on home? They're waiting for you!\nI'm in trouble, Mr. Potter. I need help. Through some sort of an accident, my company's short in their accounts. The bank examiner got there today. I've got to raise eight thousand dollars immediately.\nOh, that's what the reporters wanted to talk to you about.\nThe reporters?\nYes. They called me up from your Building and Loan. Oh, there's a man over there from the D.A.'s office, too. He's looking for you.\nPlease help me, Mr. Potter. Help me, won't you, please? Can't you see what it means to my family? I'll pay any sort of a bonus on the loan, any interest, if you still want the Building and Loan...\nGeorge, could it possibly be there's a slight discrepancy in the books?\nNo, sir, there's nothing wrong with the books. I've just misplaced eight thousand dollars. I can't find it anywhere.\n*You* misplaced eight thousand dollars?\nYes, sir.\nHave you notified the police?\nNo, sir. I didn't want the publicity. Harry's homecoming tomorrow...\nThey're going to believe that one. What've you been doing, George? Playing the market with the company's money?\nNo sir. No sir, I haven't.\nIs it a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.\nWhat?\nNot that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me? Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?\nI can't get a hold of him. He's in Europe.\nWell, what about all your other friends?\nThey don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.\nI've suddenly become quite important. What kind of security what I have, George? Have you gotten any stocks? Bonds? Real estate? Collateral of any kind?\nWell, I have some life insurance. A fifteen thousand dollar policy.\nYes. How much is your equity in it?\nFive hundred dollars.\nFive hundred dollars? And you ask me to lend you eight thousand?\nWhat have you been doing lately, George? Playing the market with the company's money?\nNo, of course not.\nOr is it a woman you're involved with? It's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.\nWhat?\nNot that it's any skin off my nose.\nGeorge, I am an old man and most people hate me. But I don't like them either, so that makes it all even. You know just as well as I do that I run practically everything in this town but the Bailey Building and Loan. You know, also, that for a number of years I've been trying to get control of it. Or kill it. But I haven't been able to do it. You have been stopping me. In fact, you have beaten me, George, and as anyone in this county can tell you, that takes some doing. Now take during the depression, for instance. You and I were the only ones that kept our heads. You saved the Building and Loan, I saved all the rest.\nYes, well, most people say you stole all the rest.\nThe envious ones say that, George. The suckers. Now, I have stated my side very frankly. Now let's look at your side. A young man, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, married, making, say, forty a week.\nForty-five!\nForty-five. Forty-five. Out of which, after supporting your mother and paying your bills, you're able to keep, say, ten, if you skimp. A child or two comes along and you won't even be able to save the ten. Now, if this young man of twenty-eight was a common, ordinary yokel, I'd say he was doing fine. But George Bailey is not a common, ordinary yokel. He is an intelligent, smart, ambitious, young man who hates his job, who hates the Building and Loan almost as much as I do. A young man who's been dying to get out on his own ever since he was born. A young man... the smartest one in the crowd, mind you... A young man who has to sit by and watch his friends go places because he's trapped. Yes, sir, trapped into frittering his life away, playing nursemaid to a lot of garlic eaters. Do I paint the correct picture or do I exaggerate?\nHave you put any real pressure on these people of yours to pay those mortgages?\nTimes are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of these people are out of work.\nWell, then, foreclose.\nI can't do that. These families have children.\nThey're not my children.\nBut they're somebody's children, Mr. Potter.\nAre you running a business or a charity ward? Not with my money!\nMr. Potter, what makes you such a hard-skulled character? You have no family, no children. You can't begin to spend all the money you've got.\nOh, I suppose I should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me!\nHe's not a failure! You can't say that about my father!\nGeorge. George. Quiet, George. Run along. Run along.\nYou're not! You're the biggest man in town!\nBigger than him, bigger than everybody!\nGives you an idea of the Baileys.\nPeter Bailey was not a businessman. That's what killed him. Oh, I don't mean any disrespect to him, God rest his soul. He was a man of high ideals. So called. But ideals without common sense can ruin this town. Now, you take this loan here to Ernie Bishop. You know, that fellow that sits around all day on his brains in his taxi, you know. I happen to know the bank turned down this loan, but he comes *here* and we're building him a house worth five thousand dollars. Why?\nWell, I handled that, Mr. Potter. You have all the papers there. His salary, insurance. I can personally vouch for his character.\nA friend of yours?\nYes, sir.\nUh-huh. You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money. What does that get us? A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas!\nGeorge, there is a rumor around town that you closed your doors. Is that true?\nOh, well, I'm very glad to hear that. George, are you all right? Do you need any police?\nPolice? What for?\nWell, mobs get pretty ugly sometimes, you know. George, I'm going all out to help in this crisis. I've just guaranteed the bank sufficient funds to meet their needs. They'll close up for a week and then reopen.\nHe just took over the bank.\nI may lose a fortune, but I'm willing to guarantee your people, too. Just tell them to bring their shares over here and I will pay fifty cents on the dollar.\nAw, you never miss a trick, do you, Potter? Well, you're going to miss this one!\nIf you close your doors before six p.m., you will never re-open!\nFifteen years ago, a half-dozen houses stuck here and there. There's the old cemetery, squirrels, buttercups, daisies. Dozens of the prettiest little homes you ever saw. Ninety per cent owned by suckers who used to pay rent to you. Your Potter's Field, my dear Mr. Employer, is becoming just that. And are the local yokels making with those David and Goliath wisecracks!\nOh, they are, are they? Even thought they know the Baileys haven't made a dime out of it.\nYou know very well why. The Baileys were all chumps. Every one of these homes is worth twice what it cost the Building and Loan to build. If I were you, Mr. Potter...\nWell, you are not me.\nAs I say, it's no skin off my nose. But one of these days this bright young man is going to be asking George Bailey for a job.\nHe\nwas a man of high ideals, so called. Ideals without common sense can ruin this town.\nErnie Bishop, you know the fella who sits around all day on his brains in his taxi?\nThe Bailey family's been a boil on my neck long enough.\nYou're not talking to someone else? You know me, remember me, George Bailey?\nGeorge Bailey. George Bailey, whose ship has just come in. Provided he has enough brains to climb aboard.\nHow does slacker George feel about that?\nVery jealous, very jealous. He only lost three buttons off his vest.\nGeorge, I am an old man, and most people hate me. But I don't like them either so that makes it all even.\nLook at you. You used to be so cocky. You were going to go out and conquer the world. You once called me \"a warped, frustrated, old man\"! What are you but a warped, frustrated young man? A miserable little clerk crawling in here on your hands and knees and begging for help.

But I don't like them either, so that makes it all even. You know just as well as I do that I run practically everything in this town but the Bailey Building and Loan. You know, also, that for a number of years I've been trying to get control of it. Or kill it. But I haven't been able to do it. You have been stopping me. In fact, you have beaten me, George, and as anyone in this county can tell you, that takes some doing. Now take during the depression, for instance. You and I were the only ones that kept our heads. You saved the Building and Loan, I saved all the rest.\nYes, well, most people say you stole all the rest.\nThe envious ones say that, George. The suckers. Now, I have stated my side very frankly. Now let's look at your side. A young man, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, married, making, say, forty a week.\nForty-five!\nForty-five. Forty-five. Out of which, after supporting your mother and paying your bills, you're able to keep, say, ten, if you skimp. A child or two comes along and you won't even be able to save the ten. Now, if this young man of twenty-eight was a common, ordinary yokel, I'd say he was doing fine. But George Bailey is not a common, ordinary yokel. He is an intelligent, smart, ambitious, young man who hates his job, who hates the Building and Loan almost as much as I do. A young man who's been dying to get out on his own ever since he was born. A young man... the smartest one in the crowd, mind you... A young man who has to sit by and watch his friends go places because he's trapped. Yes, sir, trapped into frittering his life away, playing nursemaid to a lot of garlic eaters. Do I paint the correct picture or do I exaggerate?\nHave you put any real pressure on these people of yours to pay those mortgages?\nTimes are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of these people are out of work.\nWell, then, foreclose.\nI can't do that. These families have children.\nThey're not my children.\nBut they're somebody's children, Mr. Potter.\nAre you running a business or a charity ward? Not with my money!\nMr. Potter, what makes you such a hard-skulled character? You have no family, no children. You can't begin to spend all the money you've got.\nOh, I suppose I should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me!\nHe's not a failure! You can't say that about my father!\nGeorge. George. Quiet, George. Run along. Run along.\nYou're not! You're the biggest man in town!\nBigger than him, bigger than everybody!\nGives you an idea of the Baileys.\nPeter Bailey was not a businessman. That's what killed him. Oh, I don't mean any disrespect to him, God rest his soul. He was a man of high ideals. So called. But ideals without common sense can ruin this town. Now, you take this loan here to Ernie Bishop. You know, that fellow that sits around all day on his brains in his taxi, you know. I happen to know the bank turned down this loan, but he comes *here* and we're building him a house worth five thousand dollars. Why?\nWell, I handled that, Mr. Potter. You have all the papers there. His salary, insurance. I can personally vouch for his character.\nA friend of yours?\nYes, sir.\nUh-huh. You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money. What does that get us? A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas!\nGeorge, there is a rumor around town that you closed your doors. Is that true?\nOh, well, I'm very glad to hear that. George, are you all right? Do you need any police?\nPolice? What for?\nWell, mobs get pretty ugly sometimes, you know. George, I'm going all out to help in this crisis. I've just guaranteed the bank sufficient funds to meet their needs. They'll close up for a week and then reopen.\nHe just took over the bank.\nI may lose a fortune, but I'm willing to guarantee your people, too. Just tell them to bring their shares over here and I will pay fifty cents on the dollar.\nAw, you never miss a trick, do you, Potter? Well, you're going to miss this one!\nIf you close your doors before six p.m., you will never re-open!\nFifteen years ago, a half-dozen houses stuck here and there. There's the old cemetery, squirrels, buttercups, daisies. Dozens of the prettiest little homes you ever saw. Ninety per cent owned by suckers who used to pay rent to you. Your Potter's Field, my dear Mr. Employer, is becoming just that. And are the local yokels making with those David and Goliath wisecracks!\nOh, they are, are they? Even thought they know the Baileys haven't made a dime out of it.\nYou know very well why. The Baileys were all chumps. Every one of these homes is worth twice what it cost the Building and Loan to build. If I were you, Mr. Potter...\nWell, you are not me.\nAs I say, it's no skin off my nose. But one of these days this bright young man is going to be asking George Bailey for a job.\nHe\nwas a man of high ideals, so called. Ideals without common sense can ruin this town.\nErnie Bishop, you know the fella who sits around all day on his brains in his taxi?\nThe Bailey family's been a boil on my neck long enough.\nYou're not talking to someone else? You know me, remember me, George Bailey?\nGeorge Bailey. George Bailey, whose ship has just come in. Provided he has enough brains to climb aboard.\nHow does slacker George feel about that?\nVery jealous, very jealous. He only lost three buttons off his vest. \n\nGiven quotes from the character above, which of the following tropes would you say this character represents?\n\nA: Absent Minded Professor\nB: Adventurer Archaeologist\nC: Arrogant Kungfu Guy\nD: Big Man On Campus\nE: Bounty Hunter\nF: Brainless Beauty\nG: Broken Bird\nH: Bromantic Foil\nI: Bruiser With A Soft Center\nJ: Bully\nK: Byronic Hero\nL: Casanova\nM: Chanteuse\nN: Charmer\nO: Child Prodigy\nP: Classy Cat Burglar\nQ: Consummate Professional\nR: Corrupt Corporate Executive\nS: Coward\nT: Crazy Jealous Guy\nU: Crazy Survivalist\nV: Cultured Badass\nW: Dean Bitterman\nX: Dirty Cop\nY: Ditz\nZ: Doormat\nAA: Drill Sargeant Nasty\nAB: Dumb Blonde\nAC: Dumb Muscle\nAD: Eccentric Mentor\nAE: Egomaniac Hunter\nAF: Evil Prince\nAG: Fastest Gun In The West\nAH: Father To His Men\nAI: Final Girl\nAJ: Gadgeteer Genius\nAK: Gentleman Thief\nAL: Granola Person\nAM: Grumpy Old Man\nAN: Hardboiled Detective\nAO: Heartbroken Badass\nAP: Henpecked Husband\nAQ: Hitman With A Heart\nAR: Jerk Jock\nAS: Junkie Prophet\nAT: Klutz\nAU: Loser Protagonist\nAV: Loveable Rogue\nAW: Master Swordsman\nAX: Morally Bankrupt Banker\nAY: Officer And A Gentleman\nAZ: Ophelia\nBA: Playful Hacker\nBB: Prima Donna\nBC: Psycho For Hire\nBD: Pupil Turned To Evil\nBE: Retired Outlaw\nBF: Revenge\nBG: Romantic Runnerup\nBH: Self Made Man\nBI: Slacker\nBJ: Stoner\nBK: Storyteller\nBL: Stupid Crooks\nBM: Surfer Dude\nBN: The Chief\nBO: The Editor\nBP: Tranquil Fury\nBQ: Trickster\nBR: Valley Girl\nBS: Warrior Poet\nBT: Young Gun\n",

    "100": "Well, that's great. That's just fuckin' great, man! Now what the fuck are we supposed to do? We're in some real pretty shit now, man!\nAre you finished?\nI guess we're not gonna be leaving now, right?\nI'm sorry, Newt.\nYou don't have to be sorry. It wasn't your fault.\nThat's it, man. Game over, man. Game over! What the fuck are we gonna do now? What are we gonna do?\nMaybe we can build a fire, sing a couple of songs, huh? Why don't we try that?\nWe'd better get back 'cause it'll be dark soon and they mostly come at night. Mostly.\nLook, those two specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division. Now, if you're smart, we can both come out of it as heroes and we'll be set up for life.\nYou're crazy Burke, you know that? You really think that you can get a dangerous organism like that past ICC quarantine?\nHow can they impound it if they don't know about it?\nOh, they *will* know about it, Burke, from me. Just like they'll know that you were responsible for the deaths of 158 colonists here.\nWait a second...\nYou sent them to that ship.\nYou're wrong.\nI just checked the colony log. Dated 0-6-1-2-7-9, signed Burke, Carter J. You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them. Why didn't you warn them, Burke?\nOkay, look. What if that ship didn't even exist, huh? Did you ever think about that? I didn't know! So now, if I went in and made a major security issue out of it, everybody steps in. Administration steps in, and there are no exclusive rights for anybody; nobody wins. So I made a decision and it was... wrong. It was a bad call, Ripley. It was a bad call.\nBad call?\nThese people are *dead*, Burke! Don't you have any idea what you have done here? Well, I'm gonna make sure they nail you right to the wall for this! You're not gonna sleaze your way out of this one! Right to the wall!\nRipley...! You know, I... I expected more from you. I thought you'd be smarter than this.\nI'm happy to disappoint you.\nI thought you never missed, Bishop.\nYou never said anything about an android being on board! Why not?\nPff, it never... never occurred to me. It's just common practice. We always have a synthetic on board.\nI prefer the term \"Artificial Person\" myself.\nI say we grease this rat-fuck son-of-a-bitch right now.\nIt just doesn't make any goddamn sense.\nHe figured that he could get an alien back through quarantine, if one of us was... impregnated... whatever you call it, and then frozen for the trip home. Nobody would know about the embryos we were carrying... me and Newt.\nWait a minute, now... we'd all know.\nYes. The only way he could do it is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the way home... namely, yours. Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.\nFuck. He's dead. You're dog-meat, pal!\nThis is so nuts. I mean, listen - listen to what you're saying. It's paranoid delusion. How - It's really sad. It's pathetic.\nYou know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse. You don't see them fucking each other over for a goddamn percentage.\nAll right, we waste him. No offense.\nNo. He's gotta go back.\nIs there a problem?\nI'm sorry. I don't know why I didn't even... Ripley's last trip out, the syn- the artificial person malfunctioned.\n\"Malfunctioned\"?\nThere were problems and a-a few deaths were involved.\nI'm shocked. Was it an older model?\nYeah, the Hyperdine System's 120-A2.\nWell, that explains it then. The A2s always were a bit twitchy. That could never happen now with our behavioral inhibitors. It is impossible for me to harm or by omission of action, allow to be harmed, a human being.\nAll right. We got seven canisters of CM-20. I say we roll them in there and nerve gas the whole fuckin' nest.\nIt's worth the try, but we don't know if that's gonna affect them.\nLook let's just bug out and call it even, okay? What are we even talking about this for?\nI say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit. It's the only way to be sure.\nFuckin' A!\nHold on, hold on just a second. This installation has a substantial dollar value attached to it.\nThey can *bill* me.\nOkay, I know this is an emotional moment for all of us, okay? I know that. But let's not make snap judgments, please. This is clearly... clearly an important species we're dealing with and I don't think that you or I, or *anybody*, has the right to arbitrarily exterminate them.\nWrong.\nYeah. Watch us.\nHey, maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got our asses kicked, pal!\nLook. I'm not blind to what's going on, but I cannot authorize that kind of action. I'm sorry.\nWell, I believe that Corporal Hicks... has authority here.\n*Corporal* Hicks has...\nThis operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command. Am I right, Corporal?\nYeah... yeah, that's right.\nYeah... Look, Ripley, this is a multi-million dollar installation, okay? He can't make that kind of decision. He's just a grunt! Uh, no offense.\nNone taken.\nFerro, do you copy?\nStanding by.\nPrepare for dust-off. We're gonna need immediate evac.\nRoger. On our way.\nI say we take off, nuke the site from orbit.\nIt's the only way to be sure.\nLieutenant, what do those pulse rifles fire?\n10 millimeter explosive tip caseless. Standard light armor piercing rounds. Why?\nWell, look where your team is. They're right under the primary heat exchangers.\nSo?\nSo, if they fire their weapons in there, won't they rupture the cooling system?\nHo, ho, ho. Yeah, she's absolutely right.\nSo? So what?\nLook, this whole station is basically a big fusion reactor, right? So you're talkin' about a thermonuclear explosion and adiós, muchachos.\nOh, great. Wonderful. Shit!\nI'm Burke. Carter Burke. I work for the company. But don't let that fool you, I'm really an okay guy. I'm glad to see you're feeling a little better. They, uh, they tell me that all the weakness and disorientation should pass soon. It's just natural side effects of such an unusually long hypersleep, or something like that.\nWhat do you mean? How long was I out there?\nHas no one discussed this with you yet?\nNo. But, I mean, I don't... recognize this place.\nNo, I know. Uh, okay, it's just that, uh, this might be a shock to you. It's long...\n*How* long? Please.\nFifty-seven years.\nWhat?\nThat's the thing. You were out there for fifty-seven years. What happened was, you had drifted right through the core systems, and it's really just blind luck that a deep salvage team found you when they did. It's one in a thousand, really. I think you're damn lucky to be alive, kiddo. You could be floating out there forever.\nJust tell me one thing, Burke. You're going out there to destroy them, right? Not to study. Not to bring back. But to wipe them out.\nThat's the plan. You have my word on it.\nAll right, I'm in.\nBusy little creatures, huh?\nI don't believe this. You guys throw me at the wolves, and now you want me to go back out there? Forget it. It's not my problem.\nCan I finish ?\nNo. There's no way.\nRipley, you wouldn't be going in with the troops. I can guarantee your safety.\nThese colonials marines are very though hombres. They're packing state of the art firepower. There's nothing they can't handle. Lieutenant, am I right ?\nThat's true. We've been trained to deal with situations like this.\nDo you have any news about my daughter ?\nWell we did come up with some informations. Why don't we sit down. I was hoping to wait until after the inquest... Amanda Ripley-McClaren - married name, I guess - aged 66. And that was the time of her death. Which was two years ago. I'm really sorry.\nAmy...\nUm... She was cremated and interred at Westlake Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin. No children. I checked.\nI'd promised her... that I'll be home for her birthday, Her 11th birthday.\nHow are we today ?\nTerrible\nWell, better than yesterday at least\nWhere am I ?\nYou're Safe. You're at Gateway Station, been here a couple of days. You were pretty groggy at first, but now you're OK. Looks like you've got a visitor.\nJonesy. Come here! Hey, come here.

Uh... OK. It's just that, uh, this might be a shock to you. It's longer...\nHow Long ? Please.\n57 years.\nWhat?\nThat's the thing. You're out there for 57 years. What happened is.

I checked.\nI'd promised her... that I'll be home for her birthday, Her 11th birthday.\nHow are we today ?\nTerrible\nWell, better than yesterday at least\nWhere am I ?\nYou're Safe. You're at Gateway Station, been here a couple of days. You were pretty groggy at first, but now you're OK. Looks like you've got a visitor.\nJonesy. Come here! Hey, come here. How are you, you stupid cat? How are you ? Were have you been ?\nI guess you two have met, huh . I'm Burke. Carter Burke. I work for the company. But don't let that fool you. I'm really an OK guy. I'm glad to see that you're feeling a little bit better. They told me that all the weakness and desorientation should pass soon. It's just natural side effects of such an unusally long hypersleep, or something like that...\nWhat'd you mean, How long was I out there ?\nHas no one discussed this with you yet ?\nNo. But, I mean, I don't recognise this place.\nNo, I know. Uh... OK. It's just that, uh, this might be a shock to you. It's longer...\nHow Long ? Please.\n57 years.\nWhat?\nThat's the thing. You're out there for 57 years. What happened is. You had drifted right through the core system, and It's really just blind luck that a deep-salvage team found you when they did. It was one in a thousand, really. I think you're damn lucky to be alive, kiddo. You could be floating out there forever. \n\nGiven quotes from the character above, which of the following tropes would you say this character represents?\n\nA: Absent Minded Professor\nB: Adventurer Archaeologist\nC: Arrogant Kungfu Guy\nD: Big Man On Campus\nE: Bounty Hunter\nF: Brainless Beauty\nG: Broken Bird\nH: Bromantic Foil\nI: Bruiser With A Soft Center\nJ: Bully\nK: Byronic Hero\nL: Casanova\nM: Chanteuse\nN: Charmer\nO: Child Prodigy\nP: Classy Cat Burglar\nQ: Consummate Professional\nR: Corrupt Corporate Executive\nS: Coward\nT: Crazy Jealous Guy\nU: Crazy Survivalist\nV: Cultured Badass\nW: Dean Bitterman\nX: Dirty Cop\nY: Ditz\nZ: Doormat\nAA: Drill Sargeant Nasty\nAB: Dumb Blonde\nAC: Dumb Muscle\nAD: Eccentric Mentor\nAE: Egomaniac Hunter\nAF: Evil Prince\nAG: Fastest Gun In The West\nAH: Father To His Men\nAI: Final Girl\nAJ: Gadgeteer Genius\nAK: Gentleman Thief\nAL: Granola Person\nAM: Grumpy Old Man\nAN: Hardboiled Detective\nAO: Heartbroken Badass\nAP: Henpecked Husband\nAQ: Hitman With A Heart\nAR: Jerk Jock\nAS: Junkie Prophet\nAT: Klutz\nAU: Loser Protagonist\nAV: Loveable Rogue\nAW: Master Swordsman\nAX: Morally Bankrupt Banker\nAY: Officer And A Gentleman\nAZ: Ophelia\nBA: Playful Hacker\nBB: Prima Donna\nBC: Psycho For Hire\nBD: Pupil Turned To Evil\nBE: Retired Outlaw\nBF: Revenge\nBG: Romantic Runnerup\nBH: Self Made Man\nBI: Slacker\nBJ: Stoner\nBK: Storyteller\nBL: Stupid Crooks\nBM: Surfer Dude\nBN: The Chief\nBO: The Editor\nBP: Tranquil Fury\nBQ: Trickster\nBR: Valley Girl\nBS: Warrior Poet\nBT: Young Gun\n",
    "101": "How do you go about writing a detective story?\nWell, you forget detection and concentrate on crime. Crime's the thing. And then you imagine you're going to steal something or murder somebody.\nOh, is that how you do it? It's interesting.\nYes, I usually put myself in the criminal's shoes and then I keep asking myself, uh, what do I do next?\nDo you really believe in the perfect murder?\nMmm, yes, absolutely. On paper, that is. And I think I could, uh, plan one better than most people; but I doubt if I could carry it out.\nOh? Why not?\nWell, because in stories things usually turn out the way the author wants them to; and in real life they don't... always.\nHmm.\nNo, I'm afraid my murders would be something like my bridge: I'd make some stupid mistake and never realize it until I found everybody was looking at me.\nIt's funny to think that just a year ago, I sat in that Knightsbridge Pub actually planning to murder her. And I might have done it, if I hadn't seen something that changed my mind.\nWell? What did you see?\nI saw you.\nPeople don't commit murder on credit.\nBy the way does Mrs. Van Dorn know about \"Mr. Adams\" or \"Mr. Wilson\" and Miss Wallace? You were planning to marry Mrs. Van Dorn, weren't you?\nSmart, aren't you?\nNo, not really. I've just had time to think things out. Put myself in your position. That's why I know you're going to agree.\nWhat makes you think I'll agree?\nFor the same reason that a donkey with a stick behind him and a carrot in front always goes forwards and not backwards.\nTell me about the carrot.\nAt exactly three minutes to eleven, you'll enter the house through the street door. You'll find the key to this door under the stair carpet here.\nThe fifth step?\nThat's the one. Go straight to the window, and hide behind the curtains. At exactly eleven o'clock, I shall go to the telephone in the hotel to call my boss. I shall dial the wrong number. This number. That's all I shall do.\nAs you said Mark, it might work out on paper, but congratulations, Inspector. Oh, by the way... How about you, Margot?\nYes, I could do with something.\nMark?\nSo could I.\nI suppose you're still on duty, Inspector.\nWell, that's the first and last reunion I ever went to. What a murderous thug I look.\nYes, you do, rather.\nYou know the police would only have to trace one of these notes back to you to hang us both from the same rope?\nThey won't. For a whole year I've been cashing an extra twenty pounds a week, always in fivers. I then change them for those at my leisure.\nLet me see your bank statement.\nBy all means. Don't touch.\nTurn back a page.\nAh, your balance has dropped by over a thousand pounds during the year. Suppose the police ask you about that?\nI go dog-racing twice a week.\nThey'll check your bookmaker!\nLike you, I always bet on the \"Tote.\" Satisfied?\nI'm so glad we don't have to go to Maureen's; she's such a filthy cook.\nWe had a burglary last night, and Margot was attacked. No, she's all right. But the man was killed, and the police are here now. And don't laugh... they're suggesting that Margot killed him intentionally!\nI wouldn't say that if I were you, sir.\nYou know, I think I must have seen you somewhere since we left Cambridge.\nEver been to Wimbledon?\nThat's it! Wendice. Tony Wendice. What's all this about \"Fisher\"?\nWhat's all this about \"Lesgate\"?\nWould you like a cigar?\nWhere's the nearest police station?\nOpposite the church, two minutes walk.\nSuppose I walk there now.\nWhat would you tell them?\nEverything.\nEverything? All about \"Mr. Adams\" and \"Mr. Wilson\"?\nI should simply tell them that you're trying to blackmail me into...\n...Into?\n...murdering your wife.\nI almost wish you would. When she heard that we'd have the biggest laugh of our lives.\nAren't you forgetting something?\nAm I?\nYou've told me quite a lot tonight.\nWhat of it?\nSuppose I tell them how you followed her to that studio in Chelsea and watched them cooking spaghetti and all that rubbish. Wouldn't that ring a bell?\nOh, it certainly would. They'd assume you followed her there yourself.\nMe? Why should I?\nWhy should you steal her handbag? Why should you write her all those blackmail notes? Can you prove you didn't? You certainly can't prove I did. It'll be a straight case of your word against mine.\nThat'd puzzle them, wouldn't it? What could you say?\nI should simply say that you came here tonight, half-drunk, and tried to borrow money on the strength that we were at college together. When I refused, you mentioned something about a letter belonging to my wife. As far as I could make out, you were trying to sell it to me. I gave you what money I had, and you gave me the letter. It has your fingerprints on it, remember? Then you said if I went to the police you'd tell some crazy story about my wanting you to murder my wife. Before you go any further, old boy, do consider the inconvenience. You see, I'm quite well known, and there'd be pictures of you as well. And sooner or later there'd be a deputation of landladies and lodgers who would step forward and testify as to your character. And someone is almost certain to have seen you with Miss Wallace. You were careful not to be seen around with her, I noticed. You usually met in out-of-the-way places where you wouldn't be recognized.\nOne thousand pounds in cash.\nFor a murder?\nFor a few minutes work, that's all it is. And no risk, I guarantee. That ought to appeal to you. You've been skating on pretty thin ice.\nI don't know what you're talking about.\nYou ought to know. It's in all the papers. Middle aged woman found dead due to an overdose of something. Apparently, she'd been taking the stuff for quite some time, and nobody knows where she got it. But we know, don't we? Poor Miss Wallace.\nThis thousand pounds. Where is it?\nIt's in a small attaché case in a check room.\nWhere?\nSomewhere in London. Of course we don't meet again. As soon as you've delivered the goods, I shall mail you the checkroom ticket and the key to the case. You take this hundred pounds on account.\nWhen would this take place?\nTomorrow night.\nTomorrow? Not a chance! I've got to think this over.\nIt has to be tomorrow. I've arranged things that way.\nWhere?\nApproximately where you're standing now.\nDon't make me stay home. You know how I hate doing nothing.\nDoing nothing? Why there are hundreds of things you can do. Have you written to Peggy, thanking her for the weekend? And what about those clippings? It's an ideal opportunity.\nWell I like that. You two go gallivanting while I stay home and do those boring clippings.\nWould any of you fellows have the right time?\nYes, I have. It's seven minutes past eleven.\nI make it only just after that.\nMy watch has stopped. I must have over wound it.\nSo, as I was saying...\nExcuse me, old boy, I have to call my boss.\nWhat makes you think he came in by this door?\nHis shoes.\nHis shoes?\nThe ground was soaking wet last night. If he'd come in by the garden, he'd have left mud all over the carpet. As it is, he didn't leave any marks at all, because he wiped his shoes on the front doormat.\nHow can you tell?\nIt's a fairly new mat, and some of its fibers came off on his shoes.\nOh, but surely...\nAnd there was a small tar stain on the mat, and some of the fibers show that as well. There is no question about it.\nOh, there you are. We thought you were never coming. What have you been up to?\nI'm sorry darling, but the boss came in just as I was leaving.\nTony, this is Mark Halliday.\nHello Mark.\nHello.\nHow about coming with me to a stag party?\nA stag party?\nYes, some American boys have been playing tennis all over the country. We're giving them a sort of farewell dinner.\nSounds great, but I'm not much of a tennis player.\nDoesn't matter. You know New York and all that.\nDarling, Mark's coming to the party tomorrow night.\nOh good. You better drop in here first and have a drink.\nThat's the idea.\nYes, alright. Well I'll try and get a taxi.\nNo, we can usually pick one up. So long, darling.\nEnjoy yourself.\nSo long, Tony.\nGood night.\nOh, by the way, will you be bringing the car with you?\nUh... I'm afraid I can't tonight, it's...\nThat doesn't matter. I had a good look at it anyway. Oh, you might want to bring the registration book and any necessary papers.\nYes, of course.\nI don't see why we can't settle this whole thing here and now, provided you drop the price.\nI'm afraid that's quite out of the question.\nWell, we'll see what a couple of drinks can do. Goodbye.\nGoodbye.\nGood morning, Sir. I'm Chief Inspector Hubbard, in charge of criminal investigation of this division.\nOh, I think we gave your sergeant all the necessary information.\nYes, I've seen his report of course, but there are a few things I'd like to get firsthand.\nThere is evidence however that he was blackmailing you.\nBlackmail?\nYes, I'm afraid it's true, Tony.\nAnd you suggest that he came in by the window. And we know that he came in by that door.\nBut he can't have come in that way. That door was locked. And there are only two keys. My husband had his with him, and mine was in my handbag. Here.\nYou could have let him in.\nJust a minute. I'm supposed to have come in through these windows. Suppose they'd been locked?\nIt wouldn't matter. You see, she often takes a walk around the garden before she goes to bed, and she usually forgets to lock up when she gets back. That's what I shall tell the police.\nYes, but she may say that...\nBut she isn't going to say anything, is she?\nI've been following you ever since.\nWhy?\nWell, I was hoping that sooner or later I might catch you at something and be able to, ah...\nBlackmail me?\nInfluence you.\nBy the way, how do you know my car is for sale?\nThe mechanic at your garage told me.\nThat's odd. I don't think I mentioned it to anyone there.\nWell, I stopped there one day for a fill up and told him that I was looking for a new American car to buy and he gave me your phone number. It is for sale, isn't it?\nYes, of course.\nWell, I refuse to discuss the price until you've had at least three brady's.\nHey, I warn you. I drive a hard bargain, drunk or sober. \n\nGiven quotes from the character above, which of the following tropes would you say this character represents?\n\nA: Absent Minded Professor\nB: Adventurer Archaeologist\nC: Arrogant Kungfu Guy\nD: Big Man On Campus\nE: Bounty Hunter\nF: Brainless Beauty\nG: Broken Bird\nH: Bromantic Foil\nI: Bruiser With A Soft Center\nJ: Bully\nK: Byronic Hero\nL: Casanova\nM: Chanteuse\nN: Charmer\nO: Child Prodigy\nP: Classy Cat Burglar\nQ: Consummate Professional\nR: Corrupt Corporate Executive\nS: Coward\nT: Crazy Jealous Guy\nU: Crazy Survivalist\nV: Cultured Badass\nW: Dean Bitterman\nX: Dirty Cop\nY: Ditz\nZ: Doormat\nAA: Drill Sargeant Nasty\nAB: Dumb Blonde\nAC: Dumb Muscle\nAD: Eccentric Mentor\nAE: Egomaniac Hunter\nAF: Evil Prince\nAG: Fastest Gun In The West\nAH: Father To His Men\nAI: Final Girl\nAJ: Gadgeteer Genius\nAK: Gentleman Thief\nAL: Granola Person\nAM: Grumpy Old Man\nAN: Hardboiled Detective\nAO: Heartbroken Badass\nAP: Henpecked Husband\nAQ: Hitman With A Heart\nAR: Jerk Jock\nAS: Junkie Prophet\nAT: Klutz\nAU: Loser Protagonist\nAV: Loveable Rogue\nAW: Master Swordsman\nAX: Morally Bankrupt Banker\nAY: Officer And A Gentleman\nAZ: Ophelia\nBA: Playful Hacker\nBB: Prima Donna\nBC: Psycho For Hire\nBD: Pupil Turned To Evil\nBE: Retired Outlaw\nBF: Revenge\nBG: Romantic Runnerup\nBH: Self Made Man\nBI: Slacker\nBJ: Stoner\nBK: Storyteller\nBL: Stupid Crooks\nBM: Surfer Dude\nBN: The Chief\nBO: The Editor\nBP: Tranquil Fury\nBQ: Trickster\nBR: Valley Girl\nBS: Warrior Poet\nBT: Young Gun\n",

One assumes the General might take pride in his creations instead of just foisting them on an unsuspecting public.\nYou know something? Nobody gives a rat's ass that you have to push the toast down twice. You know why? Because everybody pushes their toast down twice!\nNot where I come from.\nOh, right. Where you come from, toast is the result of reflection and study!\nAh yes, you mock me. But perhaps one day when you've awoken from a pleasant slumber to the scent of a warm brioche smothered in marmalade and fresh creamery butter, you'll understand that life is not solely composed of tasks, but tastes.\nSay that again.\nWhere I come from the meal is the result of reflection and study.

Certainly!\nI believe this is her number.\nAs I see it, Patrice has not an inkling of your affections, and it's no wonder. You, Charles, are a merry-andrew.\nA what?\nEverything plays a farce to you. Women respond to sincerity. No-one wants to be romanced by a buffoon. Now, that number rings her.\nYes?\nSo ring her tomorrow.\nI can't. She gave the number to you.\nOnly because I told her of your affections.\nWha - what did you say?\nMerely that you admired her, but you were hesitant to make an overture, as you'd been told she was courting another.\nShit... that's good! Well, what did she say?\nShe handed me the napkin.\nCharles, it's quite late.\nNo, no, she won't be home yet.

Some is in the basement.\nYou've been in the basement of the Louvre?\nWhy, yes!\nI was a art history major at Vassar!\nAhhhh...\nYou're intoxicated. We should retire.\nCan you go away?

When you have something like a nightmare, you will wake up and tell yourself that it was only a dream. It is said that the world we live in is not a bit different from this.\nYou know, in ancient cultures, bears were considered equal with men.\nThis ain't no ancient culture here, mister.\nSometimes it is.\nThe Way of the Samurai is found in death. Meditation on inevitable death should be performed daily. Every day when one's body and mind are at peace, one should meditate upon being ripped apart by arrows, rifles, spears, and swords. Being carried away by surging waves. Being thrown into the midst of a great fire. Being struck by lightning, being shaken to death by a great earthquake. Falling from thousand-foot cliffs, dying of disease, or committing seppuku at the death of one's master. And every day, without fail, one should consider himself as dead. This is the substance of the Way of the Samurai.\nAmong the maxims on Lord Naoshige's wall, there was this one: \"Matters of great concern should be treated lightly.\" Master Ittei commented, \"Matters of small concern should be treated seriously.\"\nCan't you understand what he's saying?\nNo, I don't understand him. I don't speak French, only English. I never understand a word he says.\nAnd that's your best friend?\nYeah.\nIn the words of the ancients, one should make his decision within the space of seven breaths. It is a matter of being determined and having the spirit to break through to the other side.\nOur bodies are given life from the midst of nothingness. Existing where there is nothing is the meaning of the phrase \"Form is emptiness.\" That all things are provided for by nothingness is the meaning of the phrase \"Emptiness is form.\" One should not think that these are two separate things.\nGoddamn it. You shot me in the exact same fucking place as last time!\nI'm sorry. I mean you no disrespect. You're my retainer. I don't want to put too many holes in you.\nIt is said that what is called the Spirit of an Age is something to which one cannot return. That this spirit gradually dissipates is due to the world's coming to an end. In the same way, a single year does not have just spring or summer. A single day, too, is the same. For this reason, although one would like to change today's world back to the spirit of one hundred years or more ago, it cannot be done. Thus it is important to make the best out of every generation.\nAccording to what one of the elders said, taking an enemy on the battlefield is like a hawk taking a bird. Even though it enters into the midst of a thousand of them, it gives no attention to any bird than the one it first marked.\nEven if one's head were to be suddenly cut off, he should be able to do one more action with certainty. With martial valor, if one becomes like a revengeful ghost and shows great determination, though his head is cut off, he should not die.\nWhen one has made a decision to kill a person, even if it will be very difficult to succeed by advancing straight ahead, it will not do to think about doing it in a long, roundabout way. One's heart may slacken, he may miss his chance, and by and large there will be no success. The Way of the Samurai is one of immediacy, and it is best to dash in headlong.\nGhost Dog, power, equality.\nAlways see everything, my brother.\nIt is bad when one thing becomes two. One should not look for anything else in the Way of the Samurai. It is the same for anything that is called a Way. If one understands things in this manner, he should be able to hear about all ways and be more and more in accord with his own.\nIf one were to say in a word what the condition of being a samurai is, its basis lies first in seriously devoting one's body and soul to his master.\nJesus Christ. You just shot Morini. He was Valerio's fucking brother-in-law.\nHe had a gun. He was going to shoot you.\nWhat?\nSee if he's dead.\nWell, I don't think he's getting any older.\nEverything around us seems to be changing, huh, Louie?\nYou can say that again.\nNight Nurse?

    "107": "A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti.\nI do wish we could chat longer, but... I'm having an old friend for dinner. Bye.\nDr. Lecter?... Dr. Lecter?... Dr. Lecter?... Dr. Lecter?...\nWell, Clarice - have the lambs stopped screaming?\nFirst principles, Clarice. Simplicity. Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each particular thing ask: what is it in itself? What is its nature? What does he do, this man you seek?\nHe kills women...\nNo. That is incidental. What is the first and principal thing he does? What needs does he serve by killing?\nAnger, um, social acceptance, and, huh, sexual frustrations, sir...\nNo! He covets. That is his nature. And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? Do we seek out things to covet? Make an effort to answer now.\nNo. We just...\nNo. We begin by coveting what we see every day. Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice? And don't your eyes seek out the things you want?\nTell me, Senator: did you nurse Catherine yourself?\nWhat?\nDid you breast-feed her?\nNow wait a minute...\nYes, I did.\nToughened your nipples, didn't it?\nYou son of a bitch!\nAmputate a man's leg and he can still feel it tickling. Tell me, mum, when your little girl is on the slab, where will it tickle you?\nTake this... *thing* back to Baltimore!\nFive foot ten, strongly built, about a hundred and eighty pounds; hair blonde, eyes pale blue. He'd be about thirty-five now. He said he lived in Philadelphia, but he may have lied. That's all I can remember, mum, but if I think of any more, I will let you know. Oh, and Senator, just one more thing: love your suit!\nNo!\nI will listen now. After your father's murder, you were orphaned. You were ten years old. You went to live with cousins on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And...?\nAnd one morning, I just ran away.\nNo \"just\", Clarice. What set you off? You started at what time?\nEarly, still dark.\nThen something woke you, didn't it? Was it a dream? What was it?\nI heard a strange noise.\nWhat was it?\nIt was... screaming. Some kind of screaming, like a child's voice.\nWhat did you do?\nI went downstairs, outside. I crept up into the barn. I was so scared to look inside, but I had to.\nAnd what did you see, Clarice? What did you see?\nLambs. The lambs were screaming.\nThey were slaughtering the spring lambs?\nAnd they were screaming.\nAnd you ran away?\nNo. First I tried to free them. I... I opened the gate to their pen, but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run.\nBut you could and you did, didn't you?\nYes. I took one lamb, and I ran away as fast as I could.\nWhere were you going, Clarice?\nI don't know. I didn't have any food, any water and it was very cold, very cold. I thought, I thought if I could save just one, but... he was so heavy. So heavy. I didn't get more than a few miles when the sheriff's car picked me up. The rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman. I never saw the ranch again.\nWhat became of your lamb, Clarice?\nThey killed him.\nYou know what you look like to me, with your good bag and your cheap shoes? You look like a rube. A well scrubbed, hustling rube with a little taste. Good nutrition's given you some length of bone, but you're not more than one generation from poor white trash, are you, Agent Starling? And that accent you've tried so desperately to shed: pure West Virginia. What is your father, dear? Is he a coal miner? Does he stink of the lamp? You know how quickly the boys found you... all those tedious sticky fumblings in the back seats of cars... while you could only dream of getting out... getting anywhere... getting all the way to the FBI.\nYou see a lot, Doctor. But are you strong enough to point that high-powered perception at yourself? What about it? Why don't you - why don't you look at yourself and write down what you see? Or maybe you're afraid to.\nWhere are you, Dr. Lecter?\nI've no plans to call on you, Clarice. The world is more interesting with you in it.\nWhy do you think he removes their skins, Agent Starling?\nEnthrall me with your acumen.\nIt excites him. Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies from their victims.\nI didn't.\nNo. No, you ate yours.\nLook for severe childhood disturbances associated with violence. Our Billy wasn't born a criminal, Clarice. He was made one through years of systematic abuse. Billy hates his own identity, you see, and he thinks that makes him a transsexual. But his pathology is a thousand times more savage and more terrifying.\nYou still wake up sometimes, don't you? You wake up in the dark and hear the screaming of the lambs.\nYes.\nAnd you think if you save poor Catherine, you could make them stop, don't you? You think if Catherine lives, you won't wake up in the dark ever again to that awful screaming of the lambs.\nI don't know. I don't know.\nThank you, Clarice. Thank you.\nTell me his name, Doctor.\nDr. Chilton, I presume. I think you know each other.\nOkay. Let's go.\nIt's your turn, Doctor.\nOut!\nTell me his name!\nI'm sorry, ma'am. We've got orders. We have to put you on a plane. Come on, now.\nBrave Clarice. You will let me know when those lambs stop screaming, won't you?\nTell me his name, Doctor!\nClarice, your case file. Goodbye, Clarice.\nYou're very frank, Clarice. I think it would be quite something to know you in private life.\nDid you do all these drawings, Doctor?\nAh. That is the Duomo seen from the Belvedere. Do you know Florence?\nAll that detail just from memory, sir?\nMemory, Agent Starling, is what I have instead of a view.\nJack Crawford is helping your career isn't he? Apparently he likes you and you like him too.\nI never thought about it.\nDo you think that Jack Crawford wants you sexually? True, he is much older but do you think he visualizes scenarios, exchanges, fucking you?\nThat doesn't interest me Doctor and frankly, it's, it's the sort of thing that Miggs would say.\nNot anymore.\nPeople will say we're in love.\nNow then, tell me. What did Miggs say to you? Multiple Miggs in the next cell. He hissed at you. What did he say?\nHe said, \"I can smell your cunt.\"\nI see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today.\nIf you didn't kill him, then who did, sir?\nWho can say. Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere.\n\"Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center.\" Sounds charming.\nThat's only a part of the island. There's a very, very nice beach. Terns nest there. There's beautiful...\nTerns? Mmh. If I help you, Clarice, it will be \"turns\" with us too. Quid pro quo. I tell you things, you tell me things. Not about this case, though. About yourself. Quid pro quo. Yes or no?\nYes or no, Clarice? Poor little Catherine is waiting.\nGo, doctor.\nReady when you are, Sergeant Pembry.\nCloser, please. Clo-ser...\nAll good things to those who wait.\nThere are three major centers for transsexual surgery - Johns Hopkins, University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical Center.\nAdvancement, of course. Listen carefully. Look deep within yourself, Clarice Starling. Go seek out Miss Mofet, an old patient of mine. M-o-f-e-t. Go now, I don't think Miggs could manage again quite so soon, even though he is crazy.\nGo now!\nGood evening, Clarice.\nYou fly back to school, now, little Starling. Fly, fly, fly...\nThe wig, the dress, the makeup. Raspail was a transvestite?\nIn life? Oh, no. Garden-variety Manic Depressive. Tedious, very tedious. I did not kill him I assure you just tucked him away, very much as I found him, after he'd missed three appointments.\nIf you didn't kill him, who did?\nWho can say? Best thing for him, really, his therapy was going nowhere. No, just think of him as a fledgling killer's first attempt at transformation.\nWhat do you mean fledgling killer? Do you mean he's killed again?\nI've been in this room for eight years, now Clarice, and I know they'll never let me out, not while I'm alive. What I want is a view where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution far away from Doctor Chiltern. I'll help you catch him, Clarice.\nYou know who he is, don't you? Tell me who decapitated your patient.\nAll good things to those who wait. I've waited, but how long can you and Jackie-boy wait? Our little Billy must already be looking for that next special someone.\nThat is very slippery of you, Agent Starling.\nThank you, Barney.\nWhere are your drawings?\nPunishment, you see, for Miggs. Like that Gospel Programme. When you're gone they'll turn the volume way up. Doctor Chiltern does enjoy his petty torments.\nI would not have had that happen to you, discourtesy is unspeakably ugly to me.\nThere's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive.\n...Billy is not a real transsexual. There are three major centers for transsexual surgery... I wouldn't be surprised if Billy had applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them and been rejected... Billy hates his own identity you see, and he thinks that makes him a transsexual.\nA census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti.\nI do wish we could chat longer, but... I'm having an old friend for dinner. Bye.\nDr. Lecter?... Dr. Lecter?... Dr. Lecter?... Dr. Lecter?...\nWell, Clarice - have the lambs stopped screaming?\nFirst principles, Clarice. Simplicity. Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each particular thing ask: what is it in itself? What is its nature? What does he do, this man you seek?\nHe kills women...\nNo. That is incidental. What is the first and principal thing he does? What needs does he serve by killing?\nAnger, um, social acceptance, and, huh, sexual frustrations, sir...\nNo! He covets. That is his nature. And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? Do we seek out things to covet? Make an effort to answer now.\nNo. We just...\nNo. We begin by coveting what we see every day. Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice? And don't your eyes seek out the things you want?\nTell me, Senator: did you nurse Catherine yourself?\nWhat?\nDid you breast-feed her?\nNow wait a minute...\nYes, I did.\nToughened your nipples, didn't it?\nYou son of a bitch!\nAmputate a man's leg and he can still feel it tickling. Tell me, mum, when your little girl is on the slab, where will it tickle you?\nTake this... *thing* back to Baltimore!\nFive foot ten, strongly built, about a hundred and eighty pounds; hair blonde, eyes pale blue. He'd be about thirty-five now. He said he lived in Philadelphia, but he may have lied. That's all I can remember, mum, but if I think of any more, I will let you know. Oh, and Senator, just one more thing: love your suit!\nNo!\nI will listen now. After your father's murder, you were orphaned. You were ten years old. You went to live with cousins on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And...?\nAnd one morning, I just ran away.\nNo \"just\", Clarice. What set you off? You started at what time?\nEarly, still dark.\nThen something woke you, didn't it? Was it a dream? What was it?\nI heard a strange noise.\nWhat was it?\nIt was... screaming. Some kind of screaming, like a child's voice.\nWhat did you do?\nI went downstairs, outside. I crept up into the barn. I was so scared to look inside, but I had to.\nAnd what did you see, Clarice? What did you see?\nLambs. The lambs were screaming.\nThey were slaughtering the spring lambs?\nAnd they were screaming.\nAnd you ran away?\nNo. First I tried to free them. I... I opened the gate to their pen, but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run.\nBut you could and you did, didn't you?\nYes. I took one lamb, and I ran away as fast as I could.\nWhere were you going, Clarice?\nI don't know. I didn't have any food, any water and it was very cold, very cold. I thought, I thought if I could save just one, but... he was so heavy. So heavy. I didn't get more than a few miles when the sheriff's car picked me up. The rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman. I never saw the ranch again.\nWhat became of your lamb, Clarice?\nThey killed him.\nYou know what you look like to me, with your good bag and your cheap shoes? You look like a rube. A well scrubbed, hustling rube with a little taste. Good nutrition's given you some length of bone, but you're not more than one generation from poor white trash, are you, Agent Starling? And that accent you've tried so desperately to shed: pure West Virginia. What is your father, dear? Is he a coal miner? Does he stink of the lamp? You know how quickly the boys found you... all those tedious sticky fumblings in the back seats of cars... while you could only dream of getting out... getting anywhere... getting all the way to the FBI.\nYou see a lot, Doctor. But are you strong enough to point that high-powered perception at yourself? What about it? Why don't you - why don't you look at yourself and write down what you see? Or maybe you're afraid to.\nWhere are you, Dr. Lecter?\nI've no plans to call on you, Clarice. The world is more interesting with you in it.\nWhy do you think he removes their skins, Agent Starling?\nEnthrall me with your acumen.\nIt excites him. Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies from their victims.\nI didn't.\nNo. No, you ate yours.\nLook for severe childhood disturbances associated with violence. Our Billy wasn't born a criminal, Clarice. He was made one through years of systematic abuse. Billy hates his own identity, you see, and he thinks that makes him a transsexual. But his pathology is a thousand times more savage and more terrifying.\nYou still wake up sometimes, don't you? You wake up in the dark and hear the screaming of the lambs.\nYes.\nAnd you think if you save poor Catherine, you could make them stop, don't you? You think if Catherine lives, you won't wake up in the dark ever again to that awful screaming of the lambs.\nI don't know. I don't know.\nThank you, Clarice. Thank you.\nTell me his name, Doctor.\nDr. Chilton, I presume. I think you know each other.\nOkay. Let's go.\nIt's your turn, Doctor.\nOut!\nTell me his name!\nI'm sorry, ma'am. We've got orders. We have to put you on a plane. Come on, now.\nBrave Clarice. You will let me know when those lambs stop screaming, won't you?\nTell me his name, Doctor!\nClarice, your case file. Goodbye, Clarice.\nYou're very frank, Clarice. I think it would be quite something to know you in private life.\nDid you do all these drawings, Doctor?\nAh. That is the Duomo seen from the Belvedere. Do you know Florence?\nAll that detail just from memory, sir?\nMemory, Agent Starling, is what I have instead of a view.\nJack Crawford is helping your career isn't he? Apparently he likes you and you like him too.\nI never thought about it.\nDo you think that Jack Crawford wants you sexually? True, he is much older but do you think he visualizes scenarios, exchanges, fucking you?\nThat doesn't interest me Doctor and frankly, it's, it's the sort of thing that Miggs would say.\nNot anymore.\nPeople will say we're in love.\nNow then, tell me. What did Miggs say to you? Multiple Miggs in the next cell. He hissed at you. What did he say?\nHe said, \"I can smell your cunt.\"\nI see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today.\nIf you didn't kill him, then who did, sir?\nWho can say. Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere.\n\"Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center.\" Sounds charming.\nThat's only a part of the island. There's a very, very nice beach. Terns nest there. There's beautiful...\nTerns? Mmh. If I help you, Clarice, it will be \"turns\" with us too. Quid pro quo. I tell you things, you tell me things. Not about this case, though. About yourself. Quid pro quo. Yes or no?\nYes or no, Clarice? Poor little Catherine is waiting.\nGo, doctor.\nReady when you are, Sergeant Pembry.\nCloser, please. Clo-ser...\nAll good things to those who wait.\nThere are three major centers for transsexual surgery - Johns Hopkins, University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical Center.\nAdvancement, of course. Listen carefully. Look deep within yourself, Clarice Starling. Go seek out Miss Mofet, an old patient of mine. M-o-f-e-t. Go now, I don't think Miggs could manage again quite so soon, even though he is crazy.\nGo now!\nGood evening, Clarice.\nYou fly back to school, now, little Starling. Fly, fly, fly...\nThe wig, the dress, the makeup. Raspail was a transvestite?\nIn life? Oh, no. Garden-variety Manic Depressive. Tedious, very tedious. I did not kill him I assure you just tucked him away, very much as I found him, after he'd missed three appointments.\nIf you didn't kill him, who did?\nWho can say? Best thing for him, really, his therapy was going nowhere. No, just think of him as a fledgling killer's first attempt at transformation.\nWhat do you mean fledgling killer? Do you mean he's killed again?\nI've been in this room for eight years, now Clarice, and I know they'll never let me out, not while I'm alive. What I want is a view where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution far away from Doctor Chiltern. I'll help you catch him, Clarice.\nYou know who he is, don't you? Tell me who decapitated your patient.\nAll good things to those who wait. I've waited, but how long can you and Jackie-boy wait? Our little Billy must already be looking for that next special someone.\nThat is very slippery of you, Agent Starling.\nThank you, Barney.\nWhere are your drawings?\nPunishment, you see, for Miggs.

    "108": "What else can you surmise, Mr. Bond?\nAbout you, Miss Lynd? Well, your beauty's a problem. You worry you won't be taken seriously.\nWhich one can say of any attractive woman with half a brain.\nTrue. But this one overcompensates by wearing slightly masculine clothing. Being more aggressive than her female colleagues. Which gives her a somewhat *prickly* demeanor, and ironically enough, makes it less likely for her to be accepted and promoted by her male superiors, who mistake her insecurities for arrogance. Now, I'd have normally gone with \"only child,\" but, you see, by the way you ignored the quip about your parents... I'm gonna have to go with \"orphan.\"\nAll right... by the cut of your suit, you went to Oxford or wherever. Naturally you think human beings dress like that. But you wear it with such disdain, my guess is you didn't come from money, and your school friends never let you forget it. Which means you were at that school by the grace of someone else's charity: hence that chip on your shoulder. And since your first thought about me ran to \"orphan,\" that's what I'd say you are.\nOh, you are? I like this poker thing. And that makes perfect sense! Since MI6 looks for maladjusted young men, who give little thought to sacrificing others in order to protect Queen and country. You know... former SAS types with easy smiles and expensive watches.\nRolex?\nOmega.\nBeautiful. Now, having just met you, I - wouldn't go as far as calling you a cold-hearted bastard...\nNo, of course not.\nBut it wouldn't be a stretch to imagine. You think of women as disposable pleasures, rather than meaningful pursuits. So as charming as you are, Mr. Bond, I will be keeping my eye on our government's money - and off your perfectly-formed arse.\nYou noticed?\nEven accountants have imagination. How was your lamb?\nSkewered! One sympathizes.\nGood evening, Mr. Bond.\nGood evening, Ms. Lynd.\nVodka-martini.\nShaken or stirred?\nDo I look like I give a damn?\nWhy is it that people who can't take advice always insist on giving it?\nI'm sorry. That last hand... nearly killed me.\nWe've been involved for quite a long while. Hence, the shared suite.\nBut, my family is strict Roman Catholic. So, for appearances sake, it'll be a two bedroom suite.\nI do *hate* it when religion comes between us.\nReligion - and a securely locked door. Am I going to have a problem with you, Bond?\nNo, don't worry, you're not my type.\nSmart?\nSingle.\nDry Martini.\nOui, monsieur.\nWait... three measures of Gordon's; one of vodka; half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake it over ice, and add a thin slice of lemon peel.\nYes, sir.\nYou know, I'll have one of those.\nSo will I.\nCertainly.\nMy friend, bring me one as well, keep the fruit.\nThat's it? Hm? Anyone want to play poker now?\nSomeone's in a hurry.\nI've got a little itch, down there. Would you mind?\nNow the whole world's gonna know that you died scratching my balls!\nOh... I died? I died?\nYeah! 'Cause no matter what you do, I'm not gonna give you the password which means your clients are gonna hunt you down and cut you into little pieces of meat while you're still breathing. Because if you kill me, there'll be nowhere else to hide.\nBut you are SO WRONG! 'Cause even after I slaughtered you and your little girlfriend, your people would still welcome me with open arms... because they need... what I know.\nThe big picture.\nGive me the password, and I will at least let her live.\nBond, do it soon enough and she might even be in one piece.\nYou *really* aren't going to tell me, are you?\nNo.\nYou love me?\nEnough to travel the world with you until one of us has to take an honest job... which I think is going to have to be you, because I have no idea what an honest job is.\nYou can switch off so easily, can't you? It doesn't bother you? Killing those people?\nWell I wouldn't be very good at my job if it did.\nI think I'll call it a Vesper.\nBecause of the bitter aftertaste?\nNo, because once you've tasted it, that's all you want to drink.\nYou changed your shirt, Mr Bond. I hope our little game isn't causing you to perspire.\nA little. But I won't consider myself to be in trouble until I start weeping blood.\nThe job's done and the bitch is dead.\nYou don't trust anyone, do you?\nNo.\nThen you've learned your lesson.\nYou're not going to let me in there, are you? You've got your armour back on. That's that.\nI have no armour left. You've stripped it from me. Whatever is left of me - whatever is left of me - whatever I am - I'm yours.\nI'm the money.\nEvery penny of it.\nThe name's Bond... James Bond.\nI can't resist waking you. Every time I do, you look at me as if you hadn't seen me in years. Makes me feel reborn.\nIf you had just been born, wouldn't you be naked?\nI love you too M.\nI always thought M was a randomly assigned initial, I had no idea it stood for...\nUtter one more syllable and I'll have you killed.\nI'm sorry I'm not sorry.\nStay calm and don't interrupt. Because you'll be dead within two minutes unless you do exactly what I tell you.\nI'm all ears.\nI knew it was too early to promote you.\nWell, I understand 00s have a very short life expectancy... so your mistake will be short-lived.\nI have a dinner jacket.\nThere are dinner jackets and dinner jackets; this is the latter. And I need you looking like a man who belongs at that table.\nHow?... It's tailored.\nI sized you up the moment we met.\nI'll kill her!\nAllow me.\nI should have introduced myself, seeing as we're related. Felix Leiter, a brother from Langley.\nYou should have faith. As long as you keep your head about you, I think you have him.\nHad. Excuse me.\nYou're not buying in?\nNo.\nListen, I'm bleeding chips. I'm not going to last much longer. You have a better chance. I'll stake you. I'm saying I'll give you the money to keep going. Just one thing: you pull it off, the CIA bring him in.\nWhat about the winnings?\nDoes it look like we need the money?\nI'm afraid I'm a complicated woman.\nThat is something to be afraid of.\nI would ask you if you could remain emotionally detached, but that's not your problem, is it, Bond?\nNo.\nOh, and the valet ticket.\nM doesn't mind you earning a little money on the side, Dryden. She'd just prefer it if it wasn't selling secrets.\nIf the theatrics are supposed to scare me, you have the wrong man, Bond. If M was so sure that I was bent, she'd have sent a 00. Benefits of being section chief, I'd know if anyone had been promoted to 00 status, wouldn't I? Your file shows no kills, and it takes...\nTwo.\nShame... we barely got to know each other.\nI know where you keep your gun. I suppose that's something.\nTrue. How did he die?\nYour contact? Not well.\nMade you feel it, did he? Well, you needn't worry. The second is...\nYes... considerably\nHello?\nMr. White? We need to talk.\nWho is this?\nThe name's Bond. James Bond.\nMmmmm. You like married women... don't you, James?\nIt keeps things simple.\nWhat is it about bad men? You... my husband. I had so many chances to be happy, so many nice guys. Why can't nice guys be more like you?\nBecause then they'd be bad.\nMmmmm, yes...! But, so much more interesting.\nShame. We barely got to know each other.\nI know where you keep your gun. Suppose that's something.\nCan I ask you a personal question?\nNow wouldn't seem an appropriate time.\nDo you want a clean kill or do you want to send a message?\nYou know, James, I just want you to know that if all that was left of you was your smile and your little finger, you'd still be more of a man than anyone I've ever met.\nThat's because you know what I can do with my little finger.\nI have no idea.\nBut you're aching to find out.\nI'm Mr. Arlington Beech, professional gambler, and you're Miss Stephanie Broadchest...\nI am not!\nYou're going to have to trust me on this.\nOh no I don't.\nStop touching your ear.\nSorry?\nPut your hand down!\nVesper? I do hope you gave your parents hell for that.\nYou've got a bloody cheek!\nSorry. I'll shoot the camera first next time.\nOr yourself. You stormed into an Embassy. You violated the only absolutely inviolate rule of international relations, and why? So you could kill a nobody. We wanted to question him, not to kill him! For God's sake! You're supposed to display some kind of judgement.\nI did. I thought one less bomb maker in the world would be a good thing.\nExactly. One bomb maker. We're trying to figure out how an entire network of terrorist groups is financed and you give us one bomb maker. Hardly the big picture, wouldn't you say?\nYou OK?\nMe?\nThank you.\nYou're welcome. Now get yourself off to a hospital.\nI will do. As soon as I've won this game.\nYou're not seriously going back there?\nI wouldn't dream of it.\nWell, I'm gonna need the other five million to buy back in.\nI can't do that, James.\nLook, I made a mistake. I was impatient, maybe I was arrogant, but I can beat him.\nI'm sorry.\n\"Sorry?\" Sorry! Why don't you try putting that in a sentence, like maybe, \"Sorry Le Chiffre's gonna win, continue funding terror and killing innocent people!\" That kind of \"sorry\"?\nYou lost because of your ego, and that same ego can't take it! That's what this is all about. All you're going to do now is lose more.\nWell then, you're an idiot.\nI'm sorry?\nI said you're a bloody idiot! Look in my eyes. I can beat this man - you know that.\nGet your hand off my arm.\nLooks like our man, burn scars on his face.\nHmm. I wonder if bomb-makers are insured for things like that.\nSo you want me to be half-monk, half-hitman.\nAny thug can kill. I need you to take your ego out of the equation.\nWhat makes your husband a bad man?\nHis nature, I suppose.\nThe nature of his work?\nThe mystery, I'm afraid. I'm also afraid you will sleep with me in order to get to him.\nHow afraid?\nOh, not enough to stop.\nApparently, he's on the last flight to Miami. So, you have all night to question me.\nIn that case, we're gonna need - some more champagne.\nGood evening. Can I get a bottle of chilled Bollinger Grande Année and the Beluga caviar?\nBenefits of being section chief. I'd know if anyone had been promoted to 00 status, wouldn't I? Your file shows no kills, and it takes...\nTwo.\nIt was worth it to discover his \"tell\".\nWhat'd you mean \"tell\"?\nThe twitch he has to hide when he bluffs.\nBluffs? He had the best hand.\nHe won the hand with the river card. The odds against are twenty-three to one, and he'd know that. When he made his first raise, he had nothing. Winning was blind luck.\nCould you do me a favor? I was here for dinner last night and I parked my car next to a very beautiful 1964 Aston Martin - and I'm ashamed to say I nicked the door. You wouldn't happen to know...\nMr. Dimitrios.\nRight.\nIf he hasn't noticed, I'm not sure I'd mention it. He isn't the type to take bad news well.\nYou can stop pretending. You knew I wouldn't let this drop, didn't you?\nWell, I knew you were you.\nYou want to do what to me?\nYou've lost me, completely.\nYou said you can't wait to get me back to the room, come on.\nCan I give you a lift home?\nThat would really send him over the edge. I'm afraid I'm not that corrupt.\nWell, perhaps you're just out of practice.\nWhat about a drink at my place?\nYour place? Is it close?\nVery.\nOne drink.\nShe was tortured first. As you'd already killed her husband, she must have been the only one left to question. Did she know anything that could compromise you?\nNo.\nNot your name? What you were after?\nNo.\nSo you're telling me its a matter of probability and chance. I was worried there wasn't chance involved.\nWell, usually the player with the best hand wins.\nSo, that would be what you call bluffing.\nYou've heard the term. Then you also know in poker you never play your hand. You play the man across from you.\nAnd you're good at reading people?\nYes, I am. Which is why I've been able to detect an undercurrent of sarcasm in your voice.\nYou don't think this is a very good plan, do you?\nSo there is a plan? I got the impression we were risking millions of dollars and hundreds of lives on a game of luck.\nLook, if Le Chiffre is that well connected, he knows who I am and where the money's coming from. Which means he's decided to play me anyway. So, he's either desperate or he's overly confident. But, either way, that tells me something about him. And all he gets in return is a name he already has.\nAnd now he knows something about you. He knows you're reckless.\nYou taste nice.\nHave we dispensed with the covers?\nNo. We dispensed with one that was of no use and created another that is.\nI figured out what that is. It's an Algerian love knot.\nReally? I thought it was just something pretty.\nOh, no you didn't. Someone gave that to you. He's a very lucky man.\nYou think I can't take my own advice?\nI think something is driving you - and I think I'll never find out what that is.\nYou can have me - anywhere.\nI can?\nYeah. Here. There. Anyway you like.\nDoes this mean that you're... warming to me?\nYeah. That's how I would describe it.\nIt's just that not so long ago, I would have described your feelings towards me as, eh, I'm trying to think of a better word than - loathing.\nI'm afraid I'm a complicated woman.\nThere is something to be afraid of.\nThey say you're judged by the strength of your enemies.\nSit down!\nYou're Canadian...? You work in Canadian intelligence?\nThat's all right... I know you do. And knowing this man, you likely have access to some very sensitive material that you're going to be forced to give up. His life will be threatened... and because you love him, you won't hesitate.\nThat's a beautiful necklace. Did he give it to you?\nI have one just like it. He gave it to a friend of mine... someone very close to me. Your name is...?\nCorinne.\nCorinne... Corinne, I suggest you leave now. You contact your people, and you tell them to check their seals. They have a leak. Do it now, please. This man and I have some unfinished business.\nThank you.\nPlease. Make it quick.\nCan I offer an opinion? I really think you people should find a better place to meet.\nAsk him about Slate.\nShe wants to know about Slate.\nSlate was a dead end.\nHe says it was a dead end.\nDamn it! He killed him.\nWhat are we doing?\nWe're teachers on sabbatical. This fits our cover.\nNo it doesn't. I'd rather stay at a morgue. Come on.\nHello. We're teachers on sabbatical and we've just won the lottery.\nIf you could avoid killing every possible lead, it would be deeply appreciated.\nI'll do my best.\nI've heard that before.\nThe Americans are gonna be none too pleased.\nI promised them Le Chiffre and they got him.\nThey got his body.\nWell, if they wanted his soul, they should have made a deal with a priest.\nYou killed a man in Bregenz.\nI did my best not to.\nYou shot him at point blank and threw him off a roof. I would hardly call that showing restraint!\nThis is about trust. You said you weren't motivated by revenge.\nI am motivated by my duty.\nNo... I think you're so blinded by inconsolable rage that you don't care who you hurt. When you can't tell your friends from your enemies, it's time to go.\nFriend of yours?\nI don't have any friends.\nSo, what's your interest in Greene?\nAmong other things, he tried to kill a friend of mine.\nA woman?\nYes. But it's not what you think.\nYour mother?\nShe likes to think so.\nYou know I was just wondering what South America would look like if nobody gave a damn about coke or communism. It always impressed me the way you boys would carve this place up.\nI'll take that as a compliment coming from a Brit.\nYou can't sleep?\nMay I fix you a drink, Sir?\nWhat are you drinking?\nI don't know. What am I drinking?\nThree measures of Gordon's Gin, One of Vodka, Half a measure of Kina...\nKina Lillet.\nKina Lillet, which is not Vermouth. Shaken well until it is ice cold and served with a large, thin slice of lemon peel. Six of them.\nThat's impressive.\nThey're good. You should have one.\nYou lost somebody?\nI did.\nYou catch who ever did it?\nNo, not yet.\nTell me when you do, I'd like to know how it feels...\nMr. Bond, my name is Fields. I'm from the consulate.\nOf course you are. And what do you do at the consulate Fields?\nThat's not important. My orders are to turn you around and put you on the first plane to London.\nDo those orders include my friend Mathis?\nI'm sorry, I don't know who you are.\nYou see? You've been gone for such a short time and you're already forgotten.\nYou're just saying that to hurt me.\nMr. Bond, these orders come from the highest possible authority.\nTaxi! Fields, when is the next flight to London?\nTomorrow morning.\nWell then, we have all night.\nIf you attempt to flee I will arrest you, drop you off at the jail and take you to the plane in chains, understand?\nPerfectly. After you.\nI think she has handcuffs.\nI hope so.\nYou're late!\nGot pulled into a meeting.\nI bet you make it 20 miles before you consider drinking that.\nGoodbye, Mr. Greene.\nHow much did he want?\nHe wanted you but I left the car as collateral. He'll get much more when he sells us out.\nHow long have I got?\nThirty seconds.\nThat doesn't give us a lot of time...\nMy friends call me Dominic.\nI'm sure they do.\nI don't think the dead care about vengeance.\nBond, I need you back.\nI never left.\nAre you going to tell us who you work for?\nI was always very interested to meet you. I heard so much about you from Vesper. The real shame is, if she hadn't killed herself we would've had you too.\nTake a deep breath, you only got one shot, make it count.\nDon't bleed to death.\nMy sources tell me you're Bolivian Secret Service. Or, used to be. I thought you'd infiltrated Greene's organization by having sex with him.\nThat offends you?\nNo. Not the slightest.\nIts time to get out.\nWe didn't settle on a price.\nMake me an offer.\nWe can work it out later.\nWhat happened to Slate?\nI'm not dwelling on the past. I don't think you should either.\nYou killed him.\nBond, are you missing the fact that you killed a member of the Special Branch. I need you to come in.\nAnd I would, but, right now I need to find the man who tried to kill you. Go back to sleep.\nI need some information.\nOh, you have some hard friends. This man is some kind of facilitator. Fingers in many pies and they don't leave any prints.\nDo you know how angry I am at myself?\nI can't imagine.\nYou must be furious.\nSo, its British Intelligence now. What the hell do you want from me?\nYou're going to show me Dominic Greene's Tierra Project. Are you up to it?\nDo I have a choice?\nDo you want one?\nGet in.\nAre going to try and shoot me?\nI said, get in.\nI assume you have no regrets.\nI don't! What about you?\nOf course not. It would be unprofessional.\nNow, you and I need to see this through.\nThere's no where to go. There's a capture or kill order out on you.\nWho would have done that?\nYou and I had a mutual friend!\nWhat else can you surmise, Mr. Bond?\nAbout you, Miss Lynd? Well, your beauty's a problem. You worry you won't be taken seriously.\nWhich one can say of any attractive woman with half a brain.\nTrue. But this one overcompensates by wearing slightly masculine clothing. Being more aggressive than her female colleagues. Which gives her a somewhat *prickly* demeanor, and ironically enough, makes it less likely for her to be accepted and promoted by her male superiors, who mistake her insecurities for arrogance. Now, I'd have normally gone with \"only child,\" but, you see, by the way you ignored the quip about your parents... I'm gonna have to go with \"orphan.\"\nAll right... by the cut of your suit, you went to Oxford or wherever. Naturally you think human beings dress like that. But you wear it with such disdain, my guess is you didn't come from money, and your school friends never let you forget it. Which means you were at that school by the grace of someone else's charity: hence that chip on your shoulder. And since your first thought about me ran to \"orphan,\" that's what I'd say you are.\nOh, you are? I like this poker thing. And that makes perfect sense! Since MI6 looks for maladjusted young men, who give little thought to sacrificing others in order to protect Queen and country. You know... former SAS types with easy smiles and expensive watches.\nRolex?\nOmega.\nBeautiful. Now, having just met you, I - wouldn't go as far as calling you a cold-hearted bastard...\nNo, of course not.\nBut it wouldn't be a stretch to imagine. You think of women as disposable pleasures, rather than meaningful pursuits. So as charming as you are, Mr. Bond, I will be keeping my eye on our government's money - and off your perfectly-formed arse.\nYou noticed?\nEven accountants have imagination. How was your lamb?\nSkewered! One sympathizes.\nGood evening, Mr. Bond.\nGood evening, Ms. Lynd.\nVodka-martini.\nShaken or stirred?\nDo I look like I give a damn?\nWhy is it that people who can't take advice always insist on giving it?\nI'm sorry. That last hand... nearly killed me.\nWe've been involved for quite a long while. Hence, the shared suite.\nBut, my family is strict Roman Catholic. So, for appearances sake, it'll be a two bedroom suite.\nI do *hate* it when religion comes between us.\nReligion - and a securely locked door. Am I going to have a problem with you, Bond?\nNo, don't worry, you're not my type.\nSmart?\nSingle.\nDry Martini.\nOui, monsieur.\nWait... three measures of Gordon's; one of vodka; half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake it over ice, and add a thin slice of lemon peel.\nYes, sir.\nYou know, I'll have one of those.\nSo will I.\nCertainly.\nMy friend, bring me one as well, keep the fruit.\nThat's it? Hm? Anyone want to play poker now?\nSomeone's in a hurry.\nI've got a little itch, down there. Would you mind?\nNow the whole world's gonna know that you died scratching my balls!\nOh... I died? I died?\nYeah! 'Cause no matter what you do, I'm not gonna give you the password which means your clients are gonna hunt you down and cut you into little pieces of meat while you're still breathing. Because if you kill me, there'll be nowhere else to hide.\nBut you are SO WRONG! 'Cause even after I slaughtered you and your little girlfriend, your people would still welcome me with open arms... because they need... what I know.\nThe big picture.\nGive me the password, and I will at least let her live.\nBond, do it soon enough and she might even be in one piece.\nYou *really* aren't going to tell me, are you?\nNo.\nYou love me?\nEnough to travel the world with you until one of us has to take an honest job... which I think is going to have to be you, because I have no idea what an honest job is.\nYou can switch off so easily, can't you? It doesn't bother you? Killing those people?\nWell I wouldn't be very good at my job if it did.\nI think I'll call it a Vesper.\nBecause of the bitter aftertaste?\nNo, because once you've tasted it, that's all you want to drink.\nYou changed your shirt, Mr Bond. I hope our little game isn't causing you to perspire.\nA little. But I won't consider myself to be in trouble until I start weeping blood.\nThe job's done and the bitch is dead.\nYou don't trust anyone, do you?\nNo.\nThen you've learned your lesson.\nYou're not going to let me in there, are you? You've got your armour back on. That's that.\nI have no armour left. You've stripped it from me. Whatever is left of me - whatever is left of me - whatever I am - I'm yours.\nI'm the money.\nEvery penny of it.\nThe name's Bond... James Bond.\nI can't resist waking you. Every time I do, you look at me as if you hadn't seen me in years. Makes me feel reborn.\nIf you had just been born, wouldn't you be naked?\nI love you too M.\nI always thought M was a randomly assigned initial, I had no idea it stood for...\nUtter one more syllable and I'll have you killed.\nI'm sorry I'm not sorry.\nStay calm and don't interrupt. Because you'll be dead within two minutes unless you do exactly what I tell you.\nI'm all ears.\nI knew it was too early to promote you.\nWell, I understand 00s have a very short life expectancy... so your mistake will be short-lived.\nI have a dinner jacket.\nThere are dinner jackets and dinner jackets; this is the latter. And I need you looking like a man who belongs at that table.\nHow?... It's tailored.\nI sized you up the moment we met.\nI'll kill her!\nAllow me.\nI should have introduced myself, seeing as we're related. Felix Leiter, a brother from Langley.\nYou should have faith. As long as you keep your head about you, I think you have him.\nHad. Excuse me.\nYou're not buying in?\nNo.\nListen, I'm bleeding chips. I'm not going to last much longer. You have a better chance. I'll stake you. I'm saying I'll give you the money to keep going. Just one thing: you pull it off, the CIA bring him in.\nWhat about the winnings?\nDoes it look like we need the money?\nI'm afraid I'm a complicated woman.\nThat is something to be afraid of.\nI would ask you if you could remain emotionally detached, but that's not your problem, is it, Bond?\nNo.\nOh, and the valet ticket.\nM doesn't mind you earning a little money on the side, Dryden. She'd just prefer it if it wasn't selling secrets.\nIf the theatrics are supposed to scare me, you have the wrong man, Bond. If M was so sure that I was bent, she'd have sent a 00. Benefits of being section chief, I'd know if anyone had been promoted to 00 status, wouldn't I? Your file shows no kills, and it takes...\nTwo.\nShame... we barely got to know each other.\nI know where you keep your gun. I suppose that's something.\nTrue. How did he die?\nYour contact? Not well.\nMade you feel it, did he? Well, you needn't worry. The second is...\nYes... considerably\nHello?\nMr. White? We need to talk.\nWho is this?\nThe name's Bond. James Bond.\nMmmmm. You like married women... don't you, James?\nIt keeps things simple.\nWhat is it about bad men? You... my husband. I had so many chances to be happy, so many nice guys. Why can't nice guys be more like you?\nBecause then they'd be bad.\nMmmmm, yes...! But, so much more interesting.\nShame. We barely got to know each other.\nI know where you keep your gun. Suppose that's something.\nCan I ask you a personal question?\nNow wouldn't seem an appropriate time.\nDo you want a clean kill or do you want to send a message?\nYou know, James, I just want you to know that if all that was left of you was your smile and your little finger, you'd still be more of a man than anyone I've ever met.\nThat's because you know what I can do with my little finger.\nI have no idea.\nBut you're aching to find out.\nI'm Mr. Arlington Beech, professional gambler, and you're Miss Stephanie Broadchest...\nI am not!\nYou're going to have to trust me on this.\nOh no I don't.\nStop touching your ear.\nSorry?\nPut your hand down!\nVesper? I do hope you gave your parents hell for that.\nYou've got a bloody cheek!\nSorry. I'll shoot the camera first next time.\nOr yourself. You stormed into an Embassy. You violated the only absolutely inviolate rule of international relations, and why? So you could kill a nobody. We wanted to question him, not to kill him! For God's sake! You're supposed to display some kind of judgement.\nI did. I thought one less bomb maker in the world would be a good thing.\nExactly. One bomb maker. We're trying to figure out how an entire network of terrorist groups is financed and you give us one bomb maker. Hardly the big picture, wouldn't you say?\nYou OK?\nMe?\nThank you.\nYou're welcome. Now get yourself off to a hospital.\nI will do. As soon as I've won this game.\nYou're not seriously going back there?\nI wouldn't dream of it.\nWell, I'm gonna need the other five million to buy back in.\nI can't do that, James.\nLook, I made a mistake. I was impatient, maybe I was arrogant, but I can beat him.\nI'm sorry.\n\"Sorry?\" Sorry! Why don't you try putting that in a sentence, like maybe, \"Sorry Le Chiffre's gonna win, continue funding terror and killing innocent people!\" That kind of \"sorry\"?\nYou lost because of your ego, and that same ego can't take it! That's what this is all about. All you're going to do now is lose more.\nWell then, you're an idiot.\nI'm sorry?\nI said you're a bloody idiot! Look in my eyes. I can beat this man - you know that.\nGet your hand off my arm.\nLooks like our man, burn scars on his face.\nHmm. I wonder if bomb-makers are insured for things like that.\nSo you want me to be half-monk, half-hitman.\nAny thug can kill. I need you to take your ego out of the equation.\nWhat makes your husband a bad man?\nHis nature, I suppose.\nThe nature of his work?\nThe mystery, I'm afraid. I'm also afraid you will sleep with me in order to get to him.\nHow afraid?\nOh, not enough to stop.\nApparently, he's on the last flight to Miami. So, you have all night to question me.\nIn that case, we're gonna need - some more champagne.\nGood evening. Can I get a bottle of chilled Bollinger Grande Année and the Beluga caviar?\nBenefits of being section chief. I'd know if anyone had been promoted to 00 status, wouldn't I? Your file shows no kills, and it takes...\nTwo.\nIt was worth it to discover his \"tell\".\nWhat'd you mean \"tell\"?\nThe twitch he has to hide when he bluffs.\nBluffs? He had the best hand.\nHe won the hand with the river card. The odds against are twenty-three to one, and he'd know that. When he made his first raise, he had nothing. Winning was blind luck.\nCould you do me a favor? I was here for dinner last night and I parked my car next to a very beautiful 1964 Aston Martin - and I'm ashamed to say I nicked the door. You wouldn't happen to know...\nMr. Dimitrios.\nRight.\nIf he hasn't noticed, I'm not sure I'd mention it. He isn't the type to take bad news well.\nYou can stop pretending. You knew I wouldn't let this drop, didn't you?\nWell, I knew you were you.\nYou want to do what to me?\nYou've lost me, completely.\nYou said you can't wait to get me back to the room, come on.\nCan I give you a lift home?\nThat would really send him over the edge. I'm afraid I'm not that corrupt.\nWell, perhaps you're just out of practice.\nWhat about a drink at my place?\nYour place? Is it close?\nVery.\nOne drink.\nShe was tortured first. As you'd already killed her husband, she must have been the only one left to question. Did she know anything that could compromise you?\nNo.\nNot your name? What you were after?\nNo.\nSo you're telling me its a matter of probability and chance. I was worried there wasn't chance involved.\nWell, usually the player with the best hand wins.\nSo, that would be what you call bluffing.\nYou've heard the term. Then you also know in poker you never play your hand. You play the man across from you.\nAnd you're good at reading people?\nYes, I am. Which is why I've been able to detect an undercurrent of sarcasm in your voice.\nYou don't think this is a very good plan, do you?\nSo there is a plan? I got the impression we were risking millions of dollars and hundreds of lives on a game of luck.\nLook, if Le Chiffre is that well connected, he knows who I am and where the money's coming from. Which means he's decided to play me anyway. So, he's either desperate or he's overly confident. But, either way, that tells me something about him. And all he gets in return is a name he already has.\nAnd now he knows something about you. He knows you're reckless.\nYou taste nice.\nHave we dispensed with the covers?\nNo. We dispensed with one that was of no use and created another that is.\nI figured out what that is. It's an Algerian love knot.\nReally? I thought it was just something pretty.\nOh, no you didn't. Someone gave that to you. He's a very lucky man.\nYou think I can't take my own advice?\nI think something is driving you - and I think I'll never find out what that is.\nYou can have me - anywhere.\nI can?\nYeah. Here. There. Anyway you like.\nDoes this mean that you're... warming to me?\nYeah. That's how I would describe it.\nIt's just that not so long ago, I would have described your feelings towards me as, eh, I'm trying to think of a better word than - loathing.\nI'm afraid I'm a complicated woman.\nThere is something to be afraid of.\nWhat else can you surmise, Mr. Bond?\nAbout you, Miss Lynd?

I'm gonna have to go with \"orphan.\"\nAll right... by the cut of your suit, you went to Oxford or wherever. Naturally you think human beings dress like that. But you wear it with such disdain, my guess is you didn't come from money, and your school friends never let you forget it. Which means you were at that school by the grace of someone else's charity: hence that chip on your shoulder. And since your first thought about me ran to \"orphan,\" that's what I'd say you are.\nOh, you are? I like this poker thing. And that makes perfect sense! Since MI6 looks for maladjusted young men, who give little thought to sacrificing others in order to protect Queen and country. You know... former SAS types with easy smiles and expensive watches.\nRolex?\nOmega.\nBeautiful. Now, having just met you, I - wouldn't go as far as calling you a cold-hearted bastard...\nNo, of course not.\nBut it wouldn't be a stretch to imagine. You think of women as disposable pleasures, rather than meaningful pursuits. So as charming as you are, Mr. Bond, I will be keeping my eye on our government's money - and off your perfectly-formed arse.\nYou noticed?\nEven accountants have imagination. How was your lamb?\nSkewered! One sympathizes.\nGood evening, Mr. Bond.\nGood evening, Ms. Lynd.\nVodka-martini.\nShaken or stirred?\nDo I look like I give a damn?\nWhy is it that people who can't take advice always insist on giving it?\nI'm sorry. That last hand... nearly killed me.\nWe've been involved for quite a long while. Hence, the shared suite.\nBut, my family is strict Roman Catholic. So, for appearances sake, it'll be a two bedroom suite.\nI do *hate* it when religion comes between us.\nReligion - and a securely locked door. Am I going to have a problem with you, Bond?\nNo, don't worry, you're not my type.\nSmart?\nSingle.\nDry Martini.\nOui, monsieur.\nWait... three measures of Gordon's; one of vodka; half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake it over ice, and add a thin slice of lemon peel.\nYes, sir.\nYou know, I'll have one of those.\nSo will I.\nCertainly.\nMy friend, bring me one as well, keep the fruit.\nThat's it? Hm? Anyone want to play poker now?\nSomeone's in a hurry.\nI've got a little itch, down there. Would you mind?\nNow the whole world's gonna know that you died scratching my balls!\nOh... I died? I died?\nYeah! 'Cause no matter what you do, I'm not gonna give you the password which means your clients are gonna hunt you down and cut you into little pieces of meat while you're still breathing. Because if you kill me, there'll be nowhere else to hide.\nBut you are SO WRONG! 'Cause even after I slaughtered you and your little girlfriend, your people would still welcome me with open arms... because they need... what I know.\nThe big picture.\nGive me the password, and I will at least let her live.\nBond, do it soon enough and she might even be in one piece.\nYou *really* aren't going to tell me, are you?\nNo.\nYou love me?\nEnough to travel the world with you until one of us has to take an honest job... which I think is going to have to be you, because I have no idea what an honest job is.\nYou can switch off so easily, can't you? It doesn't bother you? Killing those people?\nWell I wouldn't be very good at my job if it did.\nI think I'll call it a Vesper.\nBecause of the bitter aftertaste?\nNo, because once you've tasted it, that's all you want to drink.\nYou changed your shirt, Mr Bond. I hope our little game isn't causing you to perspire.\nA little. But I won't consider myself to be in trouble until I start weeping blood.\nThe job's done and the bitch is dead.\nYou don't trust anyone, do you?\nNo.\nThen you've learned your lesson.\nYou're not going to let me in there, are you? You've got your armour back on. That's that.\nI have no armour left. You've stripped it from me. Whatever is left of me - whatever is left of me - whatever I am - I'm yours.\nI'm the money.\nEvery penny of it.\nThe name's Bond... James Bond.\nI can't resist waking you. Every time I do, you look at me as if you hadn't seen me in years. Makes me feel reborn.\nIf you had just been born, wouldn't you be naked?\nI love you too M.\nI always thought M was a randomly assigned initial, I had no idea it stood for...\nUtter one more syllable and I'll have you killed.\nI'm sorry I'm not sorry.\nStay calm and don't interrupt. Because you'll be dead within two minutes unless you do exactly what I tell you.\nI'm all ears.\nI knew it was too early to promote you.\nWell, I understand 00s have a very short life expectancy... so your mistake will be short-lived.\nI have a dinner jacket.\nThere are dinner jackets and dinner jackets; this is the latter. And I need you looking like a man who belongs at that table.\nHow?... It's tailored.\nI sized you up the moment we met.\nI'll kill her!\nAllow me.\nI should have introduced myself, seeing as we're related. Felix Leiter, a brother from Langley.\nYou should have faith. As long as you keep your head about you, I think you have him.\nHad. Excuse me.\nYou're not buying in?\nNo.\nListen, I'm bleeding chips. I'm not going to last much longer. You have a better chance. I'll stake you. I'm saying I'll give you the money to keep going. Just one thing: you pull it off, the CIA bring him in.\nWhat about the winnings?\nDoes it look like we need the money?\nI'm afraid I'm a complicated woman.\nThat is something to be afraid of.\nI would ask you if you could remain emotionally detached, but that's not your problem, is it, Bond?\nNo.\nOh, and the valet ticket.\nM doesn't mind you earning a little money on the side, Dryden. She'd just prefer it if it wasn't selling secrets.\nIf the theatrics are supposed to scare me, you have the wrong man, Bond. If M was so sure that I was bent, she'd have sent a 00. Benefits of being section chief, I'd know if anyone had been promoted to 00 status, wouldn't I? Your file shows no kills, and it takes...\nTwo.\nShame... we barely got to know each other.\nI know where you keep your gun. I suppose that's something.\nTrue. How did he die?\nYour contact? Not well.\nMade you feel it, did he? Well, you needn't worry. The second is...\nYes... considerably\nHello?\nMr. White? We need to talk.\nWho is this?\nThe name's Bond. James Bond.\nMmmmm. You like married women... don't you, James?\nIt keeps things simple.\nWhat is it about bad men? You... my husband. I had so many chances to be happy, so many nice guys. Why can't nice guys be more like you?\nBecause then they'd be bad.\nMmmmm, yes...! But, so much more interesting.\nShame. We barely got to know each other.\nI know where you keep your gun. Suppose that's something.\nCan I ask you a personal question?\nNow wouldn't seem an appropriate time.\nDo you want a clean kill or do you want to send a message?\nYou know, James, I just want you to know that if all that was left of you was your smile and your little finger, you'd still be more of a man than anyone I've ever met.\nThat's because you know what I can do with my little finger.\nI have no idea.\nBut you're aching to find out.\nI'm Mr. Arlington Beech, professional gambler, and you're Miss Stephanie Broadchest...\nI am not!\nYou're going to have to trust me on this.\nOh no I don't.\nStop touching your ear.\nSorry?\nPut your hand down!\nVesper? I do hope you gave your parents hell for that.\nYou've got a bloody cheek!\nSorry. I'll shoot the camera first next time.\nOr yourself. You stormed into an Embassy. You violated the only absolutely inviolate rule of international relations, and why? So you could kill a nobody. We wanted to question him, not to kill him! For God's sake! You're supposed to display some kind of judgement.\nI did. I thought one less bomb maker in the world would be a good thing.\nExactly. One bomb maker. We're trying to figure out how an entire network of terrorist groups is financed and you give us one bomb maker. Hardly the big picture, wouldn't you say?\nYou OK?\nMe?\nThank you.\nYou're welcome. Now get yourself off to a hospital.\nI will do. As soon as I've won this game.\nYou're not seriously going back there?\nI wouldn't dream of it.\nWell, I'm gonna need the other five million to buy back in.\nI can't do that, James.\nLook, I made a mistake. I was impatient, maybe I was arrogant, but I can beat him.\nI'm sorry.\n\"Sorry?\" Sorry! Why don't you try putting that in a sentence, like maybe, \"Sorry Le Chiffre's gonna win, continue funding terror and killing innocent people!\" That kind of \"sorry\"?\nYou lost because of your ego, and that same ego can't take it! That's what this is all about. All you're going to do now is lose more.\nWell then, you're an idiot.\nI'm sorry?\nI said you're a bloody idiot! Look in my eyes. I can beat this man - you know that.\nGet your hand off my arm.\nLooks like our man, burn scars on his face.\nHmm. I wonder if bomb-makers are insured for things like that.\nSo you want me to be half-monk, half-hitman.\nAny thug can kill. I need you to take your ego out of the equation.\nWhat makes your husband a bad man?\nHis nature, I suppose.\nThe nature of his work?\nThe mystery, I'm afraid. I'm also afraid you will sleep with me in order to get to him.\nHow afraid?\nOh, not enough to stop.\nApparently, he's on the last flight to Miami. So, you have all night to question me.\nIn that case, we're gonna need - some more champagne.\nGood evening. Can I get a bottle of chilled Bollinger Grande Année and the Beluga caviar?\nBenefits of being section chief. I'd know if anyone had been promoted to 00 status, wouldn't I? Your file shows no kills, and it takes...\nTwo.\nIt was worth it to discover his \"tell\".\nWhat'd you mean \"tell\"?\nThe twitch he has to hide when he bluffs.\nBluffs? He had the best hand.\nHe won the hand with the river card. The odds against are twenty-three to one, and he'd know that. When he made his first raise, he had nothing. Winning was blind luck.\nCould you do me a favor? I was here for dinner last night and I parked my car next to a very beautiful 1964 Aston Martin - and I'm ashamed to say I nicked the door. You wouldn't happen to know...\nMr. Dimitrios.\nRight.\nIf he hasn't noticed, I'm not sure I'd mention it. He isn't the type to take bad news well.\nYou can stop pretending. You knew I wouldn't let this drop, didn't you?\nWell, I knew you were you.\nYou want to do what to me?\nYou've lost me, completely.\nYou said you can't wait to get me back to the room, come on.\nCan I give you a lift home?\nThat would really send him over the edge. I'm afraid I'm not that corrupt.\nWell, perhaps you're just out of practice.\nWhat about a drink at my place?\nYour place? Is it close?\nVery.\nOne drink.\nShe was tortured first. As you'd already killed her husband, she must have been the only one left to question. Did she know anything that could compromise you?\nNo.\nNot your name? What you were after?\nNo.\nSo you're telling me its a matter of probability and chance. I was worried there wasn't chance involved.\nWell, usually the player with the best hand wins.\nSo, that would be what you call bluffing.\nYou've heard the term. Then you also know in poker you never play your hand. You play the man across from you.\nAnd you're good at reading people?\nYes, I am. Which is why I've been able to detect an undercurrent of sarcasm in your voice.\nYou don't think this is a very good plan, do you?\nSo there is a plan? I got the impression we were risking millions of dollars and hundreds of lives on a game of luck.\nLook, if Le Chiffre is that well connected, he knows who I am and where the money's coming from. Which means he's decided to play me anyway. So, he's either desperate or he's overly confident. But, either way, that tells me something about him. And all he gets in return is a name he already has.\nAnd now he knows something about you. He knows you're reckless.\nYou taste nice.\nHave we dispensed with the covers?\nNo. We dispensed with one that was of no use and created another that is.\nI figured out what that is. It's an Algerian love knot.\nReally? I thought it was just something pretty.\nOh, no you didn't. Someone gave that to you. He's a very lucky man.\nYou think I can't take my own advice?\nI think something is driving you - and I think I'll never find out what that is.\nYou can have me - anywhere.\nI can?\nYeah. Here. There. Anyway you like.\nDoes this mean that you're... warming to me?\nYeah. That's how I would describe it.\nIt's just that not so long ago, I would have described your feelings towards me as, eh, I'm trying to think of a better word than - loathing.\nI'm afraid I'm a complicated woman.\nThere is something to be afraid of. \n\nGiven quotes from the character above, which of the following tropes would you say this character represents?\n\nA: Absent Minded Professor\nB: Adventurer Archaeologist\nC: Arrogant Kungfu Guy\nD: Big Man On Campus\nE: Bounty Hunter\nF: Brainless Beauty\nG: Broken Bird\nH: Bromantic Foil\nI: Bruiser With A Soft Center\nJ: Bully\nK: Byronic Hero\nL: Casanova\nM: Chanteuse\nN: Charmer\nO: Child Prodigy\nP: Classy Cat Burglar\nQ: Consummate Professional\nR: Corrupt Corporate Executive\nS: Coward\nT: Crazy Jealous Guy\nU: Crazy Survivalist\nV: Cultured Badass\nW: Dean Bitterman\nX: Dirty Cop\nY: Ditz\nZ: Doormat\nAA: Drill Sargeant Nasty\nAB: Dumb Blonde\nAC: Dumb Muscle\nAD: Eccentric Mentor\nAE: Egomaniac Hunter\nAF: Evil Prince\nAG: Fastest Gun In The West\nAH: Father To His Men\nAI: Final Girl\nAJ: Gadgeteer Genius\nAK: Gentleman Thief\nAL: Granola Person\nAM: Grumpy Old Man\nAN: Hardboiled Detective\nAO: Heartbroken Badass\nAP: Henpecked Husband\nAQ: Hitman With A Heart\nAR: Jerk Jock\nAS: Junkie Prophet\nAT: Klutz\nAU: Loser Protagonist\nAV: Loveable Rogue\nAW: Master Swordsman\nAX: Morally Bankrupt Banker\nAY: Officer And A Gentleman\nAZ: Ophelia\nBA: Playful Hacker\nBB: Prima Donna\nBC: Psycho For Hire\nBD: Pupil Turned To Evil\nBE: Retired Outlaw\nBF: Revenge\nBG: Romantic Runnerup\nBH: Self Made Man\nBI: Slacker\nBJ: Stoner\nBK: Storyteller\nBL: Stupid Crooks\nBM: Surfer Dude\nBN: The Chief\nBO: The Editor\nBP: Tranquil Fury\nBQ: Trickster\nBR: Valley Girl\nBS: Warrior Poet\nBT: Young Gun\n",

    "113": "\nHi, guys. We're going on a national bikini tour, and we're looking for two oil boys who can grease us off before each competition.\nYou are in luck! There's a town about three miles that way. I'm sure you'll find a couple guys there.\nOkay, thanks.\nDo you realize what you've done?\nHEY! HEY!\nLloyd! Lloyd!\nYou'll have to excuse my friend. He's a little slow. The town is back *that* way.\nAccording to the map, we've only gone 4 inches.\nJust when I thought you couldn't possibly be any dumber, you go and do something like this... and totally redeem yourself!\nI can't believe we drove around all day, and there's not a single job in this town. There is nothing, nada, zip!\nYeah! Unless you wanna work forty hours a week.\nWhat's her last name? I'll look it up.\nYou know, I don't really recall. Starts with an S! Let's see. Swim? Swammi? Slippy? Slappy? Swenson? Swanson?\nMaybe it's on the briefcase.\nOh, yeah! It's right here.\nSamsonite! I was way off! I knew it started with an S, though.\nShe gave me a bunch of crap about me not listening to her, or something. I don't know, I wasn't really paying attention.\nHi, Lloyd.\nHi, Harry.\nHow was your day?\nNot bad. Fell off the jet way again.\nYou're it.\nYou're it.\nYou're it, quitsies!\nAnti-quitsies, you're it, quitsies, no anti-quitsies, no startsies!\nYou can't do that!\nCan too!\nCannot, stamp it!\nCan too, double stamp it, no erasies!\nCannot, triple stamp, no erasies, Touch blue make it true.\nNo, you can't do that... you can't triple stamp a double stamp, you can't triple stamp a double stamp! Lloyd!\nLA LA LA LA LA LA!\nLLOYD! LLOYD! LLOYD!\nGUYS! ENOUGH!\nPullover!\nNo, it's a cardigan, but thanks for noticing.\nI'll bet you twenty bucks I can get you gambling before the end of the day!\nNo way!\nI'll give you three to one odds.\nNo.\nFive to one.\nNo.\nTen to one?\nYou're on!\nI'm gonna get ya!\nNuh uh!\nI don't know how, but I'm gonna get ya.\nI expected the Rocky Mountains to be a little rockier than this.\nI was thinking the same thing. That John Denver's full of shit, man.\nSo you got fired again, eh?\nOh yeah. They always freak out when you leave the scene of an accident, you know?\nYeah, well, I lost my job too.\nMan, you are one pathetic loser. No offense.\nNo, none taken. You know what really chaps my ass though? I spent my life savings turning my van into a dog. The alarm alone cost me two hundred.\nHey, chicks love it. It's a shaggin' wagon.\nOne time, we successfully mated a bulldog with a Shih-Tzu.\nReally? That's weird.\nYeah, we called it a bullshit.\nI don't get it, Lloyd. She told me ten o' clock, sharp! Are you sure you went to the right bar?\nYep. I'm pretty sure. Lobby bar right by the lobby.\n\nMaybe she just had a change of heart.\nOh, that pisses me off! That pisses me right off! I hate when women do that. She wanted to see you again! And now no? Now... Wait a minute! Wait! She must have meant ten o' clock at night!\nDo you think...?\nWhy would she have you meet her in a bar at ten in the morning?\nI just figured she was a raging alcoholic.\nWhere's the booze?\nI got robbed by a sweet old lady on a motorized cart. I didn't even see it coming.\nOh, no, no.\nCome on, Harry.\nIt gets worse. My parakeet, Petey.\nYeah?\nHe's dead.\nOh, man, I'm sorry. What happened?\nHis head fell off.\nHis head fell off?\nYeah. He was pretty old.\nI can't feel my f-fingers anymore, Lloyd. They're-they're numb!\nMaybe you should wear these extra gloves.\nMy hands are starting to get sweaty.\nExtra gloves? You've had this pair of extra gloves this whole time?\nYeah, we're in the Rockies!\nPull over!\nWhat?\nPull over!\nNo, it's a cardigan, but thanks for noticin'!\nYeah, killer boots, man!\nPull your vehicle to the side of the road! License and registration, please. You fellas were going a little fast back there, wouldn't you say? You fellas been doing a bit of boozin', have ya? Suckin back on grandpa's old cough medicine?\nNo, sir.\nNo.\nYeah, well what's that?\nThat's nothing, sir.\nYeah, nothing.\nYeah, well are you aware that it's against the law to have an open alcohol container here in the state of Pennsylvania? Come on, give me that booze, you little pumpkin pie, hair-cutted freak, come on!\nSir, no! Wait, wait, wait!\nNo, sir, don't!\nYou keep your mouth shut if you know it's good for ya, buddy!\nTic-Tac, sir?\nGet the hell out of here!\nWhere did you get those?\nI bought them when we filled up.\nWe are supposed to talk about all expenditures Lloyd! We are on a very tight budget.\nThis didn't come out of our travel fund.\nOh.\nYeah, I was able to raise 25 extra bucks before we left.\nWhere did you get 25 extra becks?\nI sold some stuff, to Billy in 4C.\nThe blind kid?\nYeah! Ha ha!\nYeah.\nWhat did you sell him Lloyd?\nStuff.\nWhat kinda stuff?\nI don't know, stuff. A few baseball cards, a sack of marbles,\nPetey.\nPetey? You sold my dead bird to a blind kid? Lloyd! Petey didn't even have a head!\nHarry, I took care of it...\nPretty bird. Yes, can you say pretty bird? Pretty bird, yeah pretty bird... Polly want a cracker?\nWhat the hell are we doing here, Harry? We gotta get out of this town!\nOh yeah, and go where? Where are we gonna go?\nI'll tell you where. Someplace warm. A place where the beer flows like wine. Where beautiful women instinctively flock like the salmon of Capistrano. I'm talking about a little place called Aspen.\nOh, I don't know, Lloyd. The French are assholes.\nMock\nYeah!\nIng\nYeah!\nBird\nYeah!\nYeah!\nYeah!\nThat was genius, Lloyd, sheer genius. I mean where did you come up with a scam like that?\nSaw it in a movie once.\nThat's incredible! So what happened, so the guy tricks some sucker into picking up his tab and gets away with it scott free?\nNo, in the movie, they catch up to him half mile down the road and slit his throat!\n\nHa ha ha! It was a good one.\nI don't know, Lloyd. These places always seem to bring back a lot of bad memories.\nWhat's the matter, Har? Some little filly break your heart?\nNo, it was a girl.\nOkay, how do you guys know each other?\nWe used to be best friends.\nYeah, till he turned into a back-stabber.\nMe, a back-stabber? You got a lot of nerve. You knew I was crazy about her!\nYeah, and you knew I was crazy about Fraida Felcher, and that didn't stop you, did it?\nWhat do you mean?\n\"What do you mean?\" Don't deny it, Lloyd. Fraida told me the whole sleazy story, Mr. French Tickler! I guess we both learned a little something about each other today.\nYou said it, pal. Maybe we're not as good of friends as we thought. I mean, if one beautiful girl can rip us apart like this, then maybe our friendship isn't worth a damn. Maybe we should call it quits right now.\nYou just tell me where to sign, bud.\nRight on my ass after you kiss it!\nKiss it! You kiss mine! Both cheeks, both lips! Right here! Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah!\nSo you'll pick me up tonight at seven forty-five?\nYo... well, y'know, I got a few things to take care of first, but what... why don't we make it quarter to eight?\nStop it.\nOkay, seven forty-five.\nOoh, look at the buns on that one.\nYeah, he must work out.\nI'm only human, Harry! Come on! Stop being a baby. So we backtracked a tad.\nA tad? A tad, Lloyd? You drove almost a sixth of the way across the country in the wrong direction! Now we don't have enough money to get to Aspen, we don't have enough money to get home, we don't have enough money to eat, we don't have enough money to sleep!\nWell, it's not gonna do us any good sitting here whining about it. We're in a hole. We're just going to have to dig ourselves out.\nWhat's with the briefcase?\nIt's a love memento. The most beautiful woman alive. I drove her to the airport. Sparks flew. Emotions ran high. She actually talked to me, man.\nGet outta here.\nOh, yeah. Tractor beam.\n\nSucked me right in. Anyway, she left this in the terminal and flew to Aspen and outta my life.\nWhat's in it?\nMan. I would have to be a lowlife to go routin' around in somebody else's private property.\nIs it locked?\nYeah, really well.\nWhat's in the briefcase?\nMan, I would have to be a real lowlife to go rooting around in someone else's private property.\nIs it locked?\nYeah. Really well.\nYesterday was one of the greatest days of my life. Mary and I went skiing, we made a snowman, she touched my leg...\nOkay, kill him!\nThe first time I set eyes on Mary Swanson, I just got that old fashioned romantic feeling where I'd do anything to bone her.\nThat's a special feeling, Lloyd.\nNice set of hooters you got there!\nI beg your pardon?\nThe owls! They're beautiful!\nShe actually talked to me.\nGet outta here!\nYou really wimped out, man.\nWhat are you talking about, wimped out? Wha... Did you see? The guy hawked on my burger!\nWould you like an atomic pepper, Mr. Mentalino?\nNah, you guys go ahead.\nI'll do it if you will, Lloyd.\nOkay. You go first.\nNo no. You go first.\nYou go first.\nYou go first! I always go first!\nYou go first!\nWhy don't you guys both stop acting like a couple of pussies and go at the same time, huh?\nThat sounds like a dare, Har.\nIt's a *double* dare!\nYeah, okay. You're on!\nWhat are you, a camel?\nAll we need to do is show a little class, a little sophistication, and we're in like a dirty shirt.\nNo problem, Lloyd. We can be classy and sophistic... Oh, check out the funbags on that hosehound.\nI'd like to eat her liver with some fava beans and a nice bottle of Chianti.\nI can't believe it.\nLife is a fragile thing, Har. One minute you're chewin' on a burger, the next minute you're dead meat.\nBut he blamed me. You heard him. Those were his last words.\nNot if you count the gurgling sound.\nFeeling better, girls?\nYes, much better! Thank you for asking!\nFlush, you bastard.\nWhat the hell? Who's the dead man that hit me with the salt shaker?\nWell, it was a terrible mistake, sir. Oh, please believe me, I would never do anything to offend a man of your size.\nKick his ass, Sea Bass!\nYou gonna eat that?\nWhat, that? No, yes, no. Well, no, I-I crossed my mind, yeah?\nStill want it?\nNah, you go ahead.\nMary Christmas. Mrs. Mary Christmas. Kinda catchy, huh, Harr?\nYeah yeah, that sounds nice. But, Lloyd, don't you think you might be jumping the gun a little bit? I mean, you know, who knows? You know, maybe, once you get to know her you'll find out that she's not your type.\nHey! Don't you ever say that again! She is the love of my life! The blood in my veins! We belong together till the mountains fall into the sea, till the heavens collide! Or until I get sick of her and need to move on. You hear me?\nOkay, okay, okay, okay. Just calm down. Just calm down.\nSo why are you guys going to Aspen? Vacation?\nWhy don't you eat up, and we'll tell ya.\nIt just doesn't seem like you packed match. All I saw was one bag and a briefcase.\nWell, no, no. The briefcase isn't even ours. Some lady left it at that airport. We're just bring it back to her. How's your burger?\nYou mean, you don't even know her? I mean talk about being in the wrong place at the wrong time.\nThere's two of 'em. One of 'em's got a gun.\nDid you pay the gas bill?\nDo you realize what you've done?\nHe's resisting me!\nHere.\nHere you go. Here you go. Here you go.\nPills! Pills are good! Pills are good!\nDrink 'em down. There you go. There you go, big guy. You want some ketchup and mustard? That helped us.\nSon of a bitch!\nCheck, please.\nWeirdo.\nSucker of big, brown dirty eggs.\nIdiot.\nFried teeth-licker of salmon fried fish!\nMoron.\nRaider of the Lost Fart!\nRump roast.\nLicker of dirty chicken butts.\nButtfish.\nMasterbatorio... er, soiler of towels.\nSHUT UP!\nI'm gonna give you my number. Let's see if I can find it...\nGreat!\nHa!\nOkay. I know I left it in here somewhere.\nLook! Why don't you just tell it to me! I have a really good memory!\nWell, the number is 555-...\n...-905 - . Oh wait! That's my home number. That is so weird how your mind just goes plain...\nFOR GOD'S SAKE! JUST GIVE ME THE DAMN NUMBER!\nOkay. Look guy! You're gonna get pushy, FORGET ABOUT IT!\nOK, gang, you know the rules, no humping, no licking, no sniffing hineys.\nSkis, huh?\nThat's right!\nGreat! They yours?\nUh-huh.\nBoth of 'em?\nYes.\nAh... cool!\nYou spilled the salt, that's what's the matter! Spilling the salt is very bad luck! We're driving across the country, the last thing we need is bad luck. Quick, toss some salt over your right shoulder.\n\nWhat the hell? Who's the dead man that hit me with the salt shaker?\nThis is the life... cold beer, a hot tub and paper-thin walls. There's only one thing that could make this moment any better.\nWhat's that?\nIf you had a nice set of knockers.\nThat's two things, Lloyd.\nYeah, well, it's a good thing you're not stacked, Harry, or I'd be banging you right now. I'd show you what a real man can do. Split you like an old piece of firewood. You'd probably like it too, you big homo.\nShut up.\nDon't tell me to shut up, woman.\nLet me ask you something. Do you want to end up like Petey? Dead? In some flea-ridden apartment? Face down in your own droppings? A soggy sunflower seed pressed against your beak? Come on, Harry! Don't you see what Petey was trying to say to you? You got to take life by the balls! Chew it up and spit it out! Dance to the tune of a different drummer! Spread your wings and fly and run and jump! God, help me!\nI don't know if I got that from his death, Lloyd. I think his head just fell off.\nWhatever!\nWhere have you been, Dunne? My dogs were supposed to be here 40 minutes ago! Now, I hardly have any time to primp them.\nDon't worry about a thing, Mrs. Noogy-Burger\nNeugeboren!\nNeu-Neu-Neuge...\n-boren.\nBoren. These pooches are not gonna need any primping. You know why? Because I bathed them, and I clipped them myself. And I stand by my performance.\nOn second thought, you may just want to run a comb through them.\nWho's got the foot long?\nYou know, on second thought, you might just want to run a comb through 'em. \n\nGiven quotes from the character above, which of the following tropes would you say this character represents?\n\nA: Absent Minded Professor\nB: Adventurer Archaeologist\nC: Arrogant Kungfu Guy\nD: Big Man On Campus\nE: Bounty Hunter\nF: Brainless Beauty\nG: Broken Bird\nH: Bromantic Foil\nI: Bruiser With A Soft Center\nJ: Bully\nK: Byronic Hero\nL: Casanova\nM: Chanteuse\nN: Charmer\nO: Child Prodigy\nP: Classy Cat Burglar\nQ: Consummate Professional\nR: Corrupt Corporate Executive\nS: Coward\nT: Crazy Jealous Guy\nU: Crazy Survivalist\nV: Cultured Badass\nW: Dean Bitterman\nX: Dirty Cop\nY: Ditz\nZ: Doormat\nAA: Drill Sargeant Nasty\nAB: Dumb Blonde\nAC: Dumb Muscle\nAD: Eccentric Mentor\nAE: Egomaniac Hunter\nAF: Evil Prince\nAG: Fastest Gun In The West\nAH: Father To His Men\nAI: Final Girl\nAJ: Gadgeteer Genius\nAK: Gentleman Thief\nAL: Granola Person\nAM: Grumpy Old Man\nAN: Hardboiled Detective\nAO: Heartbroken Badass\nAP: Henpecked Husband\nAQ: Hitman With A Heart\nAR: Jerk Jock\nAS: Junkie Prophet\nAT: Klutz\nAU: Loser Protagonist\nAV: Loveable Rogue\nAW: Master Swordsman\nAX: Morally Bankrupt Banker\nAY: Officer And A Gentleman\nAZ: Ophelia\nBA: Playful Hacker\nBB: Prima Donna\nBC: Psycho For Hire\nBD: Pupil Turned To Evil\nBE: Retired Outlaw\nBF: Revenge\nBG: Romantic Runnerup\nBH: Self Made Man\nBI: Slacker\nBJ: Stoner\nBK: Storyteller\nBL: Stupid Crooks\nBM: Surfer Dude\nBN: The Chief\nBO: The Editor\nBP: Tranquil Fury\nBQ: Trickster\nBR: Valley Girl\nBS: Warrior Poet\nBT: Young Gun\n"
