Jessica Rabbit,M,Chanteuse,"You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
You don't know how hard it is being a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
I'm not bad. I'm just drawn that way.
Okay, nobody move! All right, you weasels, grab some sky or I let the judge have it. You heard me, I said drop it!
Roger, darling!
That's right, my dear. I'd love to embrace you, but first, I have to satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
Put that gun down, you buck-toothed fool!
That's it, Doom. Give me another excuse to pump you full of lead. So you thought you could get away with it, didn't you? Ha! We toons may act idiotic, but we're not stupid. We demand justice. Why, the real meaning of the word probably hits you like a ton of bricks.
Roger! Roger, say something!
Look, stars! Ready when you are, Raoul.
Can you guess what this is?
Oh my God, it's DIP!
That's right, my dear! Enough to dip Toon Town off the face of the earth!
Vehicle of my own design; 5,000 gallons of heated dip, pumped at enormous velocity through a pressurized water cannon. Toon Town will be erased in a matter of minutes.
C'mon Roger, let's go home. I'll bake you a carrot cake.
Seriously, what do you see in that guy?
He makes me laugh.
Valiant.
I always knew I'd get it in Toontown.
Behind you!
Drop it, lady!
I just saved your life, and you still don't trust me?
I don't trust anybody or anything!
Not even your own eyes?
That's the gun that killed R.K. Maroon, and Doom pulled the trigger.
Doom?
I tracked him to the studio, but I was too late to stop him.
That's right! You'll never stop me! You're dead! You're both dead!
Doom!
Which way did he go?
I don't know. He went thataway.
Let's go.
Dum-dums.
Oh, Roger. You were magnificent.
Was I really?
Better than Goofy.
Roger, darling. I want you to know I love you. I've loved you more than any woman's ever loved a rabbit.
Well, we're not going anywhere in my car. Let's take yours.
I have a feeling someone already did.
From the looks of it I'd say it was Roger. My honey bunny was never very good behind the wheel.
Better lover than a driver, huh?
You'd better believe it, buster.
This singing ain't my line / It's hard to make a rhyme / If I get stuck, I'm... I'm out of luck, and... and...
I'm running out of time!
Thanks.
Weren't you the one I caught playing pattycake with old man Acme?
You didn't catch me, Mr. Valiant. You were set up to take those pictures.
What are you talking about?
Maroon wanted to blackmail Acme. I didn't want to have anything to do with it, but he said that if I didn't pose for those pattycake pictures, Roger would never work in this town again. I couldn't let that happen. I'd do anything for my husband, Mr. Valiant. Anything.
What a wife.
Mr. Valiant?
I hope you're proud of yourself, and those pictures you took.
So, how long have you known it was Doom?
Before poor Marvin was killed, he confided in me that Judge Doom wanted to get his hands on Toontown, and he wouldn't stop at anything.
So he gave you the will for safe keeping.
That's what he told me, except when I opened the envelope, there was only a blank piece of paper inside.
Ha! A joker to the end.
Oh, Honey Bunny!
Oh, Love Cup.
Oh, Roger! You were a pillar of strength.
Everything's funny to you, ain't it, needlenose?
You got a problem with that, Valiant?
No, I just want you to know something about the guy you're gonna dip.
Now Roger is his name / Laughter is his game / C'mon you dope, untie his rope / And watch him go insane.
He's lost his mind.
I don't think so.
Over here, Jessica. I have everything ready. Right here, on the bed.
Oh, not now, Marvin. I have a headache.
But Jessica, you promised.
Oh, all right. But this time, take off that hand buzzer.
Uh-oh. It's the weasels! This way. We'll take Gingerbread Lane.
No, no! Gingerbread Lane's this way!
So, Valiant, you call a cab or what?
Hubba, hubba, hubba!
Allow me, mademoiselle.
I suppose you think no one's going to notice Toontown's disappeared?
Who's got time to wonder what happened to some ridiculous talking mice when they're driving by at 75 miles an hour?
What're you talking about? There's no road past Toontown.
Oh, no! Where's Roger?
Roger? He chickened out on me back at the studio.
No, he didn't. I hit him over the head with a frying pan and stuck him in the trunk. So he wouldn't get hurt.
Makes perfect sense.
Rummaging around in a lady's dressing room? Tsk, tsk, tsk. What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?
Last week, some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir.
Look, doll, if I'd wanted underwear, I'd have broken into Frederick's of Hollywood. You know damn well I was looking for Marvin Acme's will.
Marvin Acme had no will. I should know; the estate's in my jurisdiction.
Oh, there was a will all right. And she and R.K. Maroon killed him for it.
That's absurd!
Someone else is in here looking for the will, too. Probably Maroon's flunkies.
I would've caught 'em, too, if Cheetah here hadn't have interrupted me!"
Tina Carlyle,M,Chanteuse,"It's a power tie. It's supposed to make you feel powerful.
Does it work?
Now, uh, how about that account? We have...
checking, savings and checking, CDs, savings and CDs, checking and CDs, savings, checking, and CDs, T-bills, or we can just take all your money and throw it in a big mattress back there.
Thanks.
For what?
Lots of things. Sharing the sunset with me. For being the only guy whose ever treated me like a person and not some sort of party favor. For being any kind of romantic. Even a hopeless one.
You're welcome.
You know that night at the club? I knew I'd found someone special.
The Mask.
No, it was the guy inside the mask. It was you all along. You, Stanley Ip... kiss.
It's like it brings your innermost desires to life. If deep down you're a little repressed, and a hopeless romantic, you become some kind of love-crazy wild man.
And if you're someone like Dorian?
Then we're all in big trouble.
Stanley? Are you all right?
Yeah. I've, never been better, really. Just... Just catching some air out here.
Your car, sir.
That's not my car.
It matches the ticket.
All right... I'll take it. But I am VERY angry. You believe this? You drive in in a Porsche...
He's going to the charity ball tonight. He's gonna do something terrible.
Like what, the Lambada?"
Susie Diamond,M,Chanteuse,"Listen to me, princess. We fucked twice. That's it. Once the sweat dries, you still don't know shit about me. Got it?
I know one thing. While Frank Baker was home putting his kids to sleep last night, little brother Jack was out dusting off his dreams for a few minutes. I was there. I saw it in your face. You're full of shit. You're a fake. Every time you walk into some shitty daiquiri hut, you're selling yourself on the cheap. Hey, I know all about that. I'd find myself at the end of the night with some creep and tell myself it didn't matter. And you kid yourself that you've got this empty place inside where you can put it all. But you do it long enough and all you are is empty.
I didn't know whores were so philosophical.
At least my brother's not my pimp. You know, I had you pegged for a loser the first time I saw you, but I was wrong. You're worse. You're a coward.
Okay, let's hear it. We trashed the Avedon, the Luau Lounge - what's our beef with 'Feelings'?
Nothing... except who cares? I mean, does anybody really need to hear 'Feelings' again in their lifetime? It's like parsley, okay? Take it away, nobody's going to know the difference.
'Feelings' is not parsley!
Frank, to you 'Feelings' may be goddamn filet mignon, but to me, it's parsley. It's *less* than parsley.
Look, 'Feelings,' despite what you may think of it, has always been one of the bright moments of the show, and a consistent crowd-pleaser, and consequently we have an obligation to perform it. If we didn't, the audience would be disappointed.
Oh. Well, they weren't exactly crying their eyes out on New Year's Eve.
You passed over 'Feelings'?
Yeah. Oh, and 'Bali Hai' went out with the bathwater, too.
Ah ha. I see. The cat goes away for the night, and the mice take over the orchestra.
Hey! I ain't no mouse.
That's right - you're parsley.
There's always another girl.
So, did you find another girl?
I didn't look.
You look good.
You look like shit.
No, I mean it. You look good.
I mean it, too. You look like shit.
Oh no, not the goddamn Luau Lounge again!
What's the matter with the Luau Lounge? They don't salt their peanuts?
Singing 'Feelings' knee-deep in paper orchids and plastic tiki lamps is not exactly my idea of a fun evening.
Fun? Who promised you fun? We get paid, remember!
It's really killing that he's so willing to make whoopee.
You're good, aren't you?
I can carry a tune.
You're better than that.
Listen, you're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not going to start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some sort of princess when I burp?
l stayed at the Hartford one time. You should see the rooms. All satin and velvet. And the bed... royal blue, trimmed in lace clean as snow. Hard to believe a room like that don't change your life. But it don't. The bed may be magic, but the mirror isn't. Still wake up the same old Susie.
So, make any resolutions?
No, you?
Nah, I figure all that stuff's a bunch of crap, anyway. You do what you do, right?
Listen, I didn't expect you to rush out and buy me a corsage this morning, you know. Your high school ring is safe.
You don't give a fuck, do you, about anything?"
Sugar Kane Kowalczyk,M,Chanteuse,"Syncopators. Does that mean you play that very fast music... jazz?
Yeah. Real Hot.
I guess some like it hot. I personally prefer classical music.
I don't care how rich he is, as long as he has a yacht, his own private railroad car, and his own toothpaste.
If my mother could only see me now.
I hope *my* mother never finds out.
Real diamonds! They must be worth their weight in gold!
Turn the lights on.
No lights, we don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
But I might spill some.
So spill it! Spills, thrills, laughs, and games. This may even turn out to be a surprise party.
What's the surprise?
Not yet.
When?
Better have a drink first.
There. That'll put hair on your chest.
No fair guessing.
I wanna be loved by you, just you, nobody else but you. I wanna be loved by you alo-o-one. Boop boop e doo.
Been waiting long?
It's not how long you wait, it's who you're waiting for!
Story of my life. I always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
Water polo? Isn't that terribly dangerous?
I'll say. I had two ponies drowned under me.
Look, if all you're interested in is whether I am married or not...
Oh, I'm not interested at all.
Well, I'm not.
That's very interesting!
I come from this musical family. My mother is a piano teacher and my father was a conductor.
Where did he conduct?
On the Baltimore and Ohio.
What is it?
It's a member of the herring family.
A herring? Isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars?
They shrink when they're marinated.
Oh, Daphne, how can I ever repay you?
Oh, I can think of a million things.
And that's one of them!
I think you're on the right track.
I must be. Your glasses are beginning to steam up.
I'm afraid it may take a little longer.
It's not how long it takes, it's who's taking you.
This is my friend Daphne, she's a Vassar girl.
I'm a what?
Or was it Bryn Mawr?
I heard a very sad story about a girl that went to Bryn Mawr. She squealed on her roommate... and they found her strangled with her own brazier!
Yes, we've got to be very careful who we choose for a roommate.
It's me, Sugar!
I never knew it could be like this!
Thank you.
They told me I was kaput, finished, all washed up. And here you are making a chump out of all those experts.
Mineral baths, now really!
Where did you learn to kiss like that?
I used to sell kisses for the milk fund.
Well I'll be back later.
Oh no you wait. I have a feeling she'll show up any minute.
Believe it or not, Josephine predicted the whole thing.
Yeah, this is one for Ripley.
Do you suppose she went shopping?
Shopping! That's it! Something tells me she's gonna come through that door in a brand new outfit!
Don't fight it.
Oh Josephine! The most wonderful thing happened!
What?
Guess.
They repealed prohibition?
Oh come now, you can do better than that.
I met one of them.
One of whom?
Shell Oil Junior. He's got millions, he's got glasses, he's got a yacht!
You don't say.
He's not only got a yacht, he's got a bicycle!
Which is the port and which is the starboard?
Well that depends. That depends on whether you're coming or going. I mean, *normally*, normally, the aft is on the other side of the stern. But - And that's the bridge, so you can get from one side of the boat to the other."
Dorothy Vallens,M,Chanteuse,"I have a part of you with me. You put your disease in me. It helps me. It makes me strong.
I have your disease in me now.
Hello, baby.
Shut up! It's Daddy, you shithead! Where's my bourbon? Can't you fucking remember anything?
I looked for you in my closet tonight.
I love you, love me!
What's your name?
Jeffrey
Jeffrey what?
Jeffrey Nothing.
He put his disease in me.
What are you doing in my closet, Jeffrey Beaumont?
And I still can see Blue Velvet through my tears.
Who are you?
I'm... just a neighbor.
What's your name, neighbor?
Jeffrey.
He's a good kid, Frank.
Shut the fuck up!
Hold me. I'm falling! I'm falling! Hold me.
Do you like the way I feel?
You think I'm crazy don't you?
I want you to stay. Don't hate me.
I sure don't hate you.
I'm not crazy.
I know the difference between right and wrong!
That's good.
You're my special friend.
I still have you inside of me!
It helps me. I need you.
I'll call you.
OK.
Soon?

Will you write to me?
Sure!
*Hey!*
What do you want to do?
I'm doing it.
Are you a bad boy?
What do you mean?
Do you want to do bad things? Anything. Anything.
What do you want?
I want you to hurt me.
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you. Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dororthy. Go the police.
No police! No police!"
Ellen Aim,M,Chanteuse,"Pay him.
Yeah, pay me!
I'm not gonna pay this jerk.
Listen, shithead, you give him some of your money, or I'll give him some of your money.
Take it easy, Cody.
I'll take it where I can get it.
You wanna change this tire, shorty?
Changing tires isn't exactly my line of work, dear.
If that's the case, then why don't you just shut up!
The famous Sorels sure put a lot of money into that bus, huh? Listen Cody, I didn't know you had a thing with Ellen in the old days, but you better get some smarts and learn to adjust to the fact that you're out of the picture now. See Cody, I do things for her. Things that a guy like you could never do. Things that matter in the real world.
You know something? The only trouble with kicking the shit out of you is it would be too easy.
OK Fish, you head back to the car. I want you in that doorway over there in fifteen minutes. And I mean fifteen minutes.
Are you crazy? They'll notice me in a second down there.
Don't worry about that, I'm gonna give them a couple of other things to worry about.
What about her? I thought she's supposed to do the driving!
Get moving, and you better be ready when we get there.
Do you trust him, or are you just desperate?
You take the front entrance, I'm going topside. If you can work your way upstairs to help me out, fine. If not, I'll handle it.
Just what I always wanted to do, Cody. Take on the Bombers."
George McFly,Z,Doormat,"Which one's your pop?
That's him.
Okay. Okay, you guys. Ah-ha-ha-ha. Very funny. You guys are being real mature.
Maybe you were adopted.
Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!
Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.
Who are you?
Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!
Lou, give me a milk.
Chocolate.
Say! Why do you let those boys push you around like that for?
Well, they're bigger than me.
Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?
Watch it, Goldie.
No, sir! I'm gonna make something of myself. I'm going to night school, and one day, I'm gonna be somebody!
That's right! He's gonna be mayor.
Yeah, I'm...
Mayor! Now *that's* a good idea! I could run for mayor.
A colored mayor. That'll be the day.
You wait and see, Mr. Caruthers. I *will* be mayor! I'll be the most powerful man in Hill Valley, and I'm gonna clean up this town.
Good. You can start by sweeping the floor.
Mayor Goldie Wilson. I like the sound of that.
I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!
Blind spot? Now, now, Biff, now I never noticed that the car had any blind spot before when I would drive it. Hi, Son.
What, are you blind, McFly? It's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there?
Biff, can I- Can I assume that your, uh, insurance is gonna pay for the damage?
My insurance? It's your car. Your insurance should pay for it. I wanna know who's gonna pay for this?
I spilled beer all over it when the car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill?
Let's go over the plan again, so eight-thirty where are you going to be?
I'm gonna be at the dance.
And where am I gonna be?
You're going to be in the car with her...
Right, so right around nine o'clock she's going to get very angry with me.
Why would she get angry with you?
Because, George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them.
Ho! Hooo! You-you mean you're going to go touch her on her -
No, no, no listen, George it's just an act! Okay? So around nine o'clock you're walking through the parking lot, you see us... struggling in the car. You walk up, you open the door and you say
... your line, George!
Oh! ""Hey you! Get your damn hands off her!""
I know what you're gonna say, Son, and you're right.
You're right. But, uh, Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm just not very good at... confrontations.
But the car, Dad. I mean, he wrecked it. He totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad. I mean, do you have any idea how important this was to me? Do you have any clue?
I know, and all I can say is I'm... I'm sorry.
Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.
What?
Oh. What I meant to say was...
Wait a minute. Don't I know you from somewhere?
Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density. I mean, your destiny.
Marty! Marty! Marty!
Hey, George, buddy, you weren't at school. What have you been doing all day?
I overslept. Look, I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it.
Alright, okay, listen, keep your pants on. She's over in the cafe.
What made you change your mind, George?
Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine, that he'd melt my brain!
Yeah, well, uh, let's keep this brain-melting stuff to ourselves, okay?
Oh, yeah! Yeah!
You really think I ought to swear?
Yes, definitely. Goddamn it, George, swear.
I've never picked a fight in my entire life.
Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.
Mr. McFly! Mr. McFly, this just arrived. Oh, hi, Marty. I think it's your new book.
Oh, honey! Your first novel.
Like I've always told you, you put your mind to it, you can accomplish *anything*.
Oh, Marty. Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight.
Keys?

Operator! Operator, can you give me the time?
Dixon, I got to get out! Dixon, this isn't funny! What? Dixon!
Mr. Strickland, those no-good guys, they just locked me in.
You see. You see what happens to slackers, McFly?
Yes. Yes! Mr. Strickland, you've got to let me out of here!
Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.
I'm just finishing up the second coat now.
Now, Biff, don't con me.
I'm sorry, Mr. McFly. I-I meant I was just starting on the second coat.
Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...
We never would have fallen in love.
That's right.
I think we need a rematch.
Oh, a rematch. Why? Were you cheating?
No. Good morning
Hello.
And where's my reports?
Well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know, I... I figured since they weren't due till...
Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?
Of course not, Biff. Now, I wouldn't want that to happen. Now, look. I'll, uh, finish those reports on up tonight, and I'll run 'em on over first thing tomorrow, all right?
Not too early. I sleep in Saturday. Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied.
Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.
Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind."
Harry Dunne,Z,Doormat,"
Hi, guys. We're going on a national bikini tour, and we're looking for two oil boys who can grease us off before each competition.
You are in luck! There's a town about three miles that way. I'm sure you'll find a couple guys there.
Okay, thanks.
Do you realize what you've done?
HEY! HEY!
Lloyd! Lloyd!
You'll have to excuse my friend. He's a little slow. The town is back *that* way.
According to the map, we've only gone 4 inches.
Just when I thought you couldn't possibly be any dumber, you go and do something like this... and totally redeem yourself!
I can't believe we drove around all day, and there's not a single job in this town. There is nothing, nada, zip!
Yeah! Unless you wanna work forty hours a week.
What's her last name? I'll look it up.
You know, I don't really recall. Starts with an S! Let's see. Swim? Swammi? Slippy? Slappy? Swenson? Swanson?
Maybe it's on the briefcase.
Oh, yeah! It's right here.
Samsonite! I was way off! I knew it started with an S, though.
She gave me a bunch of crap about me not listening to her, or something. I don't know, I wasn't really paying attention.
Hi, Lloyd.
Hi, Harry.
How was your day?
Not bad. Fell off the jet way again.
You're it.
You're it.
You're it, quitsies!
Anti-quitsies, you're it, quitsies, no anti-quitsies, no startsies!
You can't do that!
Can too!
Cannot, stamp it!
Can too, double stamp it, no erasies!
Cannot, triple stamp, no erasies, Touch blue make it true.
No, you can't do that... you can't triple stamp a double stamp, you can't triple stamp a double stamp! Lloyd!
LA LA LA LA LA LA!
LLOYD! LLOYD! LLOYD!
GUYS! ENOUGH!
Pullover!
No, it's a cardigan, but thanks for noticing.
I'll bet you twenty bucks I can get you gambling before the end of the day!
No way!
I'll give you three to one odds.
No.
Five to one.
No.
Ten to one?
You're on!
I'm gonna get ya!
Nuh uh!
I don't know how, but I'm gonna get ya.
I expected the Rocky Mountains to be a little rockier than this.
I was thinking the same thing. That John Denver's full of shit, man.
So you got fired again, eh?
Oh yeah. They always freak out when you leave the scene of an accident, you know?
Yeah, well, I lost my job too.
Man, you are one pathetic loser. No offense.
No, none taken. You know what really chaps my ass though? I spent my life savings turning my van into a dog. The alarm alone cost me two hundred.
Hey, chicks love it. It's a shaggin' wagon.
One time, we successfully mated a bulldog with a Shih-Tzu.
Really? That's weird.
Yeah, we called it a bullshit.
I don't get it, Lloyd. She told me ten o' clock, sharp! Are you sure you went to the right bar?
Yep. I'm pretty sure. Lobby bar right by the lobby.

Maybe she just had a change of heart.
Oh, that pisses me off! That pisses me right off! I hate when women do that. She wanted to see you again! And now no? Now... Wait a minute! Wait! She must have meant ten o' clock at night!
Do you think...?
Why would she have you meet her in a bar at ten in the morning?
I just figured she was a raging alcoholic.
Where's the booze?
I got robbed by a sweet old lady on a motorized cart. I didn't even see it coming.
Oh, no, no.
Come on, Harry.
It gets worse. My parakeet, Petey.
Yeah?
He's dead.
Oh, man, I'm sorry. What happened?
His head fell off.
His head fell off?
Yeah. He was pretty old.
I can't feel my f-fingers anymore, Lloyd. They're-they're numb!
Maybe you should wear these extra gloves.
My hands are starting to get sweaty.
Extra gloves? You've had this pair of extra gloves this whole time?
Yeah, we're in the Rockies!
Pull over!
What?
Pull over!
No, it's a cardigan, but thanks for noticin'!
Yeah, killer boots, man!
Pull your vehicle to the side of the road! License and registration, please. You fellas were going a little fast back there, wouldn't you say? You fellas been doing a bit of boozin', have ya? Suckin back on grandpa's old cough medicine?
No, sir.
No.
Yeah, well what's that?
That's nothing, sir.
Yeah, nothing.
Yeah, well are you aware that it's against the law to have an open alcohol container here in the state of Pennsylvania? Come on, give me that booze, you little pumpkin pie, hair-cutted freak, come on!
Sir, no! Wait, wait, wait!
No, sir, don't!
You keep your mouth shut if you know it's good for ya, buddy!
Tic-Tac, sir?
Get the hell out of here!
Where did you get those?
I bought them when we filled up.
We are supposed to talk about all expenditures Lloyd! We are on a very tight budget.
This didn't come out of our travel fund.
Oh.
Yeah, I was able to raise 25 extra bucks before we left.
Where did you get 25 extra becks?
I sold some stuff, to Billy in 4C.
The blind kid?
Yeah! Ha ha!
Yeah.
What did you sell him Lloyd?
Stuff.
What kinda stuff?
I don't know, stuff. A few baseball cards, a sack of marbles,
Petey.
Petey? You sold my dead bird to a blind kid? Lloyd! Petey didn't even have a head!
Harry, I took care of it...
Pretty bird. Yes, can you say pretty bird? Pretty bird, yeah pretty bird... Polly want a cracker?
What the hell are we doing here, Harry? We gotta get out of this town!
Oh yeah, and go where? Where are we gonna go?
I'll tell you where. Someplace warm. A place where the beer flows like wine. Where beautiful women instinctively flock like the salmon of Capistrano. I'm talking about a little place called Aspen.
Oh, I don't know, Lloyd. The French are assholes.
Mock
Yeah!
Ing
Yeah!
Bird
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
That was genius, Lloyd, sheer genius. I mean where did you come up with a scam like that?
Saw it in a movie once.
That's incredible! So what happened, so the guy tricks some sucker into picking up his tab and gets away with it scott free?
No, in the movie, they catch up to him half mile down the road and slit his throat!

Ha ha ha! It was a good one.
I don't know, Lloyd. These places always seem to bring back a lot of bad memories.
What's the matter, Har? Some little filly break your heart?
No, it was a girl.
Okay, how do you guys know each other?
We used to be best friends.
Yeah, till he turned into a back-stabber.
Me, a back-stabber? You got a lot of nerve. You knew I was crazy about her!
Yeah, and you knew I was crazy about Fraida Felcher, and that didn't stop you, did it?
What do you mean?
""What do you mean?"" Don't deny it, Lloyd. Fraida told me the whole sleazy story, Mr. French Tickler! I guess we both learned a little something about each other today.
You said it, pal. Maybe we're not as good of friends as we thought. I mean, if one beautiful girl can rip us apart like this, then maybe our friendship isn't worth a damn. Maybe we should call it quits right now.
You just tell me where to sign, bud.
Right on my ass after you kiss it!
Kiss it! You kiss mine! Both cheeks, both lips! Right here! Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah!
So you'll pick me up tonight at seven forty-five?
Yo... well, y'know, I got a few things to take care of first, but what... why don't we make it quarter to eight?
Stop it.
Okay, seven forty-five.
Ooh, look at the buns on that one.
Yeah, he must work out.
I'm only human, Harry! Come on! Stop being a baby. So we backtracked a tad.
A tad? A tad, Lloyd? You drove almost a sixth of the way across the country in the wrong direction! Now we don't have enough money to get to Aspen, we don't have enough money to get home, we don't have enough money to eat, we don't have enough money to sleep!
Well, it's not gonna do us any good sitting here whining about it. We're in a hole. We're just going to have to dig ourselves out.
What's with the briefcase?
It's a love memento. The most beautiful woman alive. I drove her to the airport. Sparks flew. Emotions ran high. She actually talked to me, man.
Get outta here.
Oh, yeah. Tractor beam.

Sucked me right in. Anyway, she left this in the terminal and flew to Aspen and outta my life.
What's in it?
Man. I would have to be a lowlife to go routin' around in somebody else's private property.
Is it locked?
Yeah, really well.
What's in the briefcase?
Man, I would have to be a real lowlife to go rooting around in someone else's private property.
Is it locked?
Yeah. Really well.
Yesterday was one of the greatest days of my life. Mary and I went skiing, we made a snowman, she touched my leg...
Okay, kill him!
The first time I set eyes on Mary Swanson, I just got that old fashioned romantic feeling where I'd do anything to bone her.
That's a special feeling, Lloyd.
Nice set of hooters you got there!
I beg your pardon?
The owls! They're beautiful!
She actually talked to me.
Get outta here!
You really wimped out, man.
What are you talking about, wimped out? Wha... Did you see? The guy hawked on my burger!
Would you like an atomic pepper, Mr. Mentalino?
Nah, you guys go ahead.
I'll do it if you will, Lloyd.
Okay. You go first.
No no. You go first.
You go first.
You go first! I always go first!
You go first!
Why don't you guys both stop acting like a couple of pussies and go at the same time, huh?
That sounds like a dare, Har.
It's a *double* dare!
Yeah, okay. You're on!
What are you, a camel?
All we need to do is show a little class, a little sophistication, and we're in like a dirty shirt.
No problem, Lloyd. We can be classy and sophistic... Oh, check out the funbags on that hosehound.
I'd like to eat her liver with some fava beans and a nice bottle of Chianti.
I can't believe it.
Life is a fragile thing, Har. One minute you're chewin' on a burger, the next minute you're dead meat.
But he blamed me. You heard him. Those were his last words.
Not if you count the gurgling sound.
Feeling better, girls?
Yes, much better! Thank you for asking!
Flush, you bastard.
What the hell? Who's the dead man that hit me with the salt shaker?
Well, it was a terrible mistake, sir. Oh, please believe me, I would never do anything to offend a man of your size.
Kick his ass, Sea Bass!
You gonna eat that?
What, that? No, yes, no. Well, no, I-I crossed my mind, yeah?
Still want it?
Nah, you go ahead.
Mary Christmas. Mrs. Mary Christmas. Kinda catchy, huh, Harr?
Yeah yeah, that sounds nice. But, Lloyd, don't you think you might be jumping the gun a little bit? I mean, you know, who knows? You know, maybe, once you get to know her you'll find out that she's not your type.
Hey! Don't you ever say that again! She is the love of my life! The blood in my veins! We belong together till the mountains fall into the sea, till the heavens collide! Or until I get sick of her and need to move on. You hear me?
Okay, okay, okay, okay. Just calm down. Just calm down.
So why are you guys going to Aspen? Vacation?
Why don't you eat up, and we'll tell ya.
It just doesn't seem like you packed match. All I saw was one bag and a briefcase.
Well, no, no. The briefcase isn't even ours. Some lady left it at that airport. We're just bring it back to her. How's your burger?
You mean, you don't even know her? I mean talk about being in the wrong place at the wrong time.
There's two of 'em. One of 'em's got a gun.
Did you pay the gas bill?
Do you realize what you've done?
He's resisting me!
Here.
Here you go. Here you go. Here you go.
Pills! Pills are good! Pills are good!
Drink 'em down. There you go. There you go, big guy. You want some ketchup and mustard? That helped us.
Son of a bitch!
Check, please.
Weirdo.
Sucker of big, brown dirty eggs.
Idiot.
Fried teeth-licker of salmon fried fish!
Moron.
Raider of the Lost Fart!
Rump roast.
Licker of dirty chicken butts.
Buttfish.
Masterbatorio... er, soiler of towels.
SHUT UP!
I'm gonna give you my number. Let's see if I can find it...
Great!
Ha!
Okay. I know I left it in here somewhere.
Look! Why don't you just tell it to me! I have a really good memory!
Well, the number is 555-...
...-905 - . Oh wait! That's my home number. That is so weird how your mind just goes plain...
FOR GOD'S SAKE! JUST GIVE ME THE DAMN NUMBER!
Okay. Look guy! You're gonna get pushy, FORGET ABOUT IT!
OK, gang, you know the rules, no humping, no licking, no sniffing hineys.
Skis, huh?
That's right!
Great! They yours?
Uh-huh.
Both of 'em?
Yes.
Ah... cool!
You spilled the salt, that's what's the matter! Spilling the salt is very bad luck! We're driving across the country, the last thing we need is bad luck. Quick, toss some salt over your right shoulder.

What the hell? Who's the dead man that hit me with the salt shaker?
This is the life... cold beer, a hot tub and paper-thin walls. There's only one thing that could make this moment any better.
What's that?
If you had a nice set of knockers.
That's two things, Lloyd.
Yeah, well, it's a good thing you're not stacked, Harry, or I'd be banging you right now. I'd show you what a real man can do. Split you like an old piece of firewood. You'd probably like it too, you big homo.
Shut up.
Don't tell me to shut up, woman.
Let me ask you something. Do you want to end up like Petey? Dead? In some flea-ridden apartment? Face down in your own droppings? A soggy sunflower seed pressed against your beak? Come on, Harry! Don't you see what Petey was trying to say to you? You got to take life by the balls! Chew it up and spit it out! Dance to the tune of a different drummer! Spread your wings and fly and run and jump! God, help me!
I don't know if I got that from his death, Lloyd. I think his head just fell off.
Whatever!
Where have you been, Dunne? My dogs were supposed to be here 40 minutes ago! Now, I hardly have any time to primp them.
Don't worry about a thing, Mrs. Noogy-Burger
Neugeboren!
Neu-Neu-Neuge...
-boren.
Boren. These pooches are not gonna need any primping. You know why? Because I bathed them, and I clipped them myself. And I stand by my performance.
On second thought, you may just want to run a comb through them.
Who's got the foot long?
You know, on second thought, you might just want to run a comb through 'em."
Belle,Z,Doormat,"You said you'd never leave.
I wasn't trying to leave. I was just trying to make you happy.
You broke your word. And for that, you'll rot in this dungeon forever.
I should've known you'd never be anything - but a beast.
It's a... a Yule log.
Huh?
A Yule log. It's a wonderful tradition. One log is chosen, and everyone in the house touches it and makes a Christmas wish.
Wishes are stupid. You made a Christmas wish last year.
IS THIS WHAT YOU WISHED FOR!
No. But I will keep wishing. And when the log is burnt on Christmas morning...
There will BE no Christmas.
But...
NO! I am the master here!
How can you be so selfish?
You cannot possibly understand. You have no idea what it's like to lose everything, to be trapped in your own castle, to be a - a - uh...
Prisoner? The only one holding us prisoner here is you. Well, I'm not giving up!
Prisoner...
Belle... what's - Christmas?
Oh, Chip, you must know about Christmas. Stockings in front of the fire. Tree? Tinsle? Presents?
Presents! Will I get one?
Of course, everyone gets a present on Christmas.
Aw, even the master?
Yes, even the master.
Doesn't look so special to me.
Oh, Chip, I'm sorry. Nothing's changed.
I told you nothing would change. I told you the master would not allow this. I told you Christmas was a hopeless folly. But, I was wrong.
When I felt lost and lonely, not a dream in my head, your words lifted my spirits high. Remember what you said: As long as there's Christmas, I truly believe...
, :

That hope is the greatest of the gifts we'll receive. As long as our guiding star shines above...
, :

That hope is the greatest of the gifts we'll receive. As long as our guiding star shines above...
There'll always be Christmas.
So there always will be a time when the world is filled with peace and love.
Forbid Christmas? No one can forbid Christmas.
1,001. 1,002. 1,003. Are we there yet?
Not yet.
Oh boy, there are sure a lot of steps here! 1,007. 1,008. 1,009. 1,010...
You belong side by side, you should never be apart, 'cause when you're both together, you're really twice as smart.
Twice as smart... she does have a point.
Yes. Well, two heads are better than one.
Hi, Belle.
Hello! Chip, do you know what day it is?
Well, it's not Tuesday...
No, silly. Today is December 24th. The day before Christmas.
And what a beautiful day it is.
Mademoiselle, please. I am Maestro Forte, court composer and your most humble servant.
Please to meet you, Monsieur Forte. I'm Belle."
Stu Price,Z,Doormat,"She's got my grandmother's Holocaust ring!
I didn't know they gave out rings at the Holocaust.
What do tigers dream of when they take their little tiger snooze? Do they dream of mauling zebras, or Halle Berry in her Catwoman suit? Don't you worry your pretty striped head, we're gonna get you back to Tyson and your cozy tiger bed. And then we're gonna find our best friend Doug, and then we're gonna give him a best friend hug. Doug, Doug, oh, Doug, Dougie, Dougie, Doug, Doug! But if he's been murdered by crystal meth tweakers,
well then we're shit out of luck.
I just wish your friends were as mature as you.
They are mature, actually. You just have to get to know them better.
Paging Dr. Faggot. Dr. Faggot!
I should go.
That's a good idea, Dr. Faggot.
It says here we should work in teams. Who wants to be my spotter?
I don't think you should be doing too much gambling tonight, Alan.
Gambling? Who said anything about gambling? It's not gambling when you know you're gonna win. Counting cards is a foolproof system.
It's also illegal.
It's not illegal. It's frowned upon, like masturbating on an airplane.
I'm pretty sure that's illegal too.
Yeah, maybe after 9/11, where everybody got so sensitive. Thanks a lot, bin Laden.
Guys. Guys. What about the tiger? What if he got out?
Oh, fuck! I keep forgetting about the goddamn tiger! How the fuck did he get in there?
I don't know, because I don't remember.
Shh! Stu. Stu, keep it down.
One of the side effects of roofies is memory loss.
You are literally too stupid to insult.
By the way man, where you get that cop car from?
We uh, stole it from these dumbass cops.
*Nice*!
*Nice*! High five there!... That's nice!
Why would you go to Las Vegas?
'Cause my best friend was getting married, and that's what guys do.
That's not what *you* do.
Really? Well, then why did I do it? Huh? 'Cause I did it! Riddle me that! Why'd I do it? You know, sometimes I think all you want me to do is what you want me to do. Well, I'm sick of doing what you want me to do all the time. I think, in a healthy relationship, sometimes a guy should be able to do what he wants to do.
That is not how this works!
Oh, good! Because whatever this is ain't workin' for me!
Oh, really? Since when?
Since you fucked that waiter on your cruise last June! BOOM!
You told me it was a bartender.
Oh! You're right. I stand corrected. It was a bartender. You fucked a bartender.
You're an idiot!
You're a - You...
You're... such a bad person! Like, all the way through to your core!
Hey guys, when's the next Haley's comet?
Who cares, man.
Do you know Stu?
I don't think it's for like another sixty years or something.
But it's not tonight right?
No I don't think so.
But you don't know for sure? I have this cousin Marcus who saw one he said it blew his mind I want to make sure I never ever miss out on a Haley's comet.
Either way, you gotta be super smart to count cards, buddy, okay?
Oh, really?
It's not easy.
Okay, well, maybe we should tell that to Rain Man, because he practically bankrupt a casino, and he was a retard.
What?
He was a retard.
*RE*tard.
It's funny, 'cause just the other day, me and my boy, we was wonderin' why they even call 'em roofies. Y'know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
No. Don't know what you're talkin' 'bout.
Why not floories, right? 'Cause when you take 'em, you're more likely to end up on the floor than the roof. What about groundies? That's a good new name fo' 'em.
Or how 'bout rapies?
Whose fucking baby is that?
Alan, are you sure you didn't see anyone else in the suite?
Yeah, I checked all the rooms... no one's there. Check its collar or something.
We're in a stolen cop car with what is sure to be a missing child in the back. What part of this is cool?
I think the cop car part's pretty cool.
How's my hair?
That's good.
It's cool like Phil's?
It's classic Phil.
We look at these pictures together, OK? One time. And then we delete the evidence.
I say we delete it right now.
Are you nuts? I want to find out how I went to the hospital. Is that in there?
Yeah it's in there!
Guys, one time. Deal?
Deal!
Deal.
OK.
Oh dear Lord!
That's classic!
You are a fucking moron!
Your language is offensive.
Fuck you!
Here's something I would like to remind you two of: our best friend Doug is probably face down in a ditch right now with a meth head butt-fucking his corpse!
That's highly unlikely.
That is not Doug.
What're you talking about, Willis? That him!
No, I'm sorry, Mr. Chow, that's not our friend, he... it's...
The Doug we're looking for is a white.
Why don't we remember a God damn thing from last night?
Obviously because we had a great fucking time.
We're going to be okay. Everything's going to be ok, alright?
WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?
I lost a tooth! I married a whore!
This does not seem fair.
It's rock-paper-scissors. There's nothin' more fair.
Whoah, we're not leaving a baby in the car.
He'll be fine. I cracked a window.
What the hell is that?
What's it look like?
If it's what I think it is, it's a big fucking mistake!
She's not that bad.
Doug, she beats him!
That was once, and I was out of line.
Phil, we're not even going to be in the room. It's one night, we can share beds. It's no big deal.
Uh, if we're sharing beds, I'm bunking with Phil. You cool with that?
No, I'm not cool with that.
Why are you peppering the steak? You don't know if tigers like pepper.
Tigers *love* pepper. They hate cinnamon.
So, uh, are you sure you're qualified to be taking care of that baby?
What are you talking about? I've found a baby before.
You found a baby before? Where?
Coffee Bean.
Ew! Alan, did you just eat sofa pizza?
Yes.
Stu, we don't have time for this. Look, let's go hook up with Doug, and we'll deal with the baby later.
Phil, we're not gonna leave a baby in the room, there's a fucking tiger in the bathroom!
It's not our baby.
Yeah, I gotta side with Stu on this one.
We don't want to call attention to ourselves!
Attention! Attention!
Don't let the beard fool you. He's a child!
You know, everyone says Mike Tyson is such a badass, but I think he's kind of a sweetheart.
I think he's mean.
Fuck those guys! You hear me? That was bullshit! I'm tellin' everybody we stole a cop car! You can't just do that! You can't just tease people because you think it's funny! That's police brutality!
I'm getting a soda. You guys want anything?
No.
Hey what's that on your arm?
Oh my God - Phil, you were in the hospital last night.
Yeah, I guess I was.
Are you okay?
I look like a nerdy hillbilly!
That's my grandma's ring. She made it all the way through the holocaust with that thing. It's legit.
All good with Melissa?
Oh, yeah. Told her we're two hours outside of wine country, and she bought it.
Don't you think it's strange that you've been in a relationship for three years and you still have to lie about going to Vegas?
Yeah, I do. But trust me, it's not worth the fight.
Oh, so you can't go to Vegas but she can fuck a bellhop on a Carnival Cruise Line?
Okay, first of all, he was a bartender. And she was wasted. And, if you must know, he didn't even come inside her.
And you believe that?
Uh, yeah, I do believe that, because she's grossed out by semen.
You found the car?
Yeah! It was parked in the middle of Las Vegas Blvd. with a note that said ""Couldn't find a meter, so here's $4.""
I'll tell you another thing - 6 to 1 odds our car is beat to shit.
Come on Stu.
No seriously how much you want to bet it's fucked up beyond all recognition?
By the way, we're all gonna die.
We can even write you a check right now.
No chance. Cash only.
There's a person in there!
They are mature, you just have to get to know them better..."
Giacomo Casanova,L,Casanova,"Be the flame - not the moth.
She has a secret lover? Who?
I don't know, it's a secret.
Casanova, the philosopher? Who devotes his life to the perfection of experience? Yes, I know him.
No, Casanova the libertine, who devotes his life to seducing women.
Well, we're obviously talking about the same person.
You are charged with heresy. To wit: fornicating with a novice!
She was hardly a novice.
I've never sought glory as a lover.
What then, senor Casanova, do you seek?
A moment that lasts a lifetime.
What's this 'we?' You slapped him, you fight him.
I have too long dominated the conversation. What are your thoughts on the matter?
What did you just say?
To say I love falsely is as contradictory as to say I believe falsely.
I've got to stay here. If I go with you they'll be looking for both of us. It's too dangerous!
What if you never left?
The choice of lime is very sliming.
You're too kind.
I, too, come here to make confession.
What have you to confess?
Well, let's see. Jealousy. Pride. Covetousness. Despair. And you?
I came to prepare my soul for marriage.
She has a fiance...
So do you.
You have sullied my glove! I mean, uh, my love. My love.
I'm sorry. What did he just called us?
We didn't sully it. It just came out of nowhere.
You've sullied my love. Victoria Donato is my fiancée.
Is she?
Yes. In the sense that I am going to marry her.
Ah. Well, she never mentioned that.
Of course she didn't. I haven't asked her yet.
We were worried about us!
You were right to be. We're getting married.
Congratulations. To whom?
Don't know yet.
And what did we do that for?
I don't know.
Congratulations, we're getting married.
What, are you two working together now?
Do we have a spare sword?
Yea we do.
No, Lupo, I'm... oh, could I have some tea?
I'm not going, I don't want to go, you can't make me!
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Yes, I can.
Oh, God.
Good God, you've achieved the impossible."
Telly,L,Casanova,"When you're young, not much matters. When you find something that you care about, then that's all you got. When you go to sleep at night you dream of pussy. When you wake up it's the same thing. It's there in your face. You can't escape it. Sometimes when you're young the only place to go is inside. That's just it - fucking is what I love. Take that away from me and I really got nothing.
How did she smell? Did her puss stink?
Take a whiff.
Mmmmm. Butterscotch, yo. That's the best.
But like, if you deflower a girl man, man, you're the man. No one can ever do that again. You're the only one. No one, no one, has the power to do that again.
Right. The way I see it. My outlook on the situation. It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying? Say you was to die tomorrow right, fifty years from now all the virgins you ever fucked are gonna remember you. Right? They gonna tell their grandkids about that shit.
That girl was 12, you hit that shit up?
Who am I? I'm the motha-fuckin virgin surgeon.
I'm askin' you one last time. Do you got ""dis-tick""?
What are you saying, ""dis-tick""?
He said this dick, motherfucker!
I think if we fuck, you would love it!
So this is your new girl, huh?
I hope so. For now.
You like 'em kinda young, right? Babies?
I like 'em new. Not like you.
You got any money?
Three pennies and a ball o' lint, kiiiddd.
Condoms don't work. They either break, or they slip off, or they make your dick shrink. Nah, but you still gotta use em, yo. At least I did once.
Virgins. I love 'em. No diseases, no loose as a goose pussy, no skank. No nothin. Just pure pleasure.
You happen to have dis dig?
Wha?
This dig. I'm curious. Do you have it?
What is dis dig?
Dis dig.
What do you say?
This dig. I'm curious. Do you have it?
Wha?
Dis dig man. Dis dig, dis dig...
I don't understand... I don't understand you... uhhh.
OK... one last time. Do you have dis dig?
What you say... dis dig?

Tony Stark,"AJ, L, K","Gadgeteer Genius, Casanova, Byronic Hero","There's been speculation that I was involved in the events that occurred on the freeway and the rooftop...
I'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you honestly expect us to believe that that was a bodyguard in a suit that conveniently appeared, despite the fact that...
I know that it's confusing. It is one thing to question the official story, and another thing entirely to make wild accusations, or insinuate that I'm a superhero.
I never said you were a superhero.
Didn't?
Mmm-mmm.
Well, good, because that would be outlandish and, uh, fantastic. I'm just not the hero type. Clearly. With this laundry list of character defects, all the mistakes I've made, largely public.
Just stick to the cards, man.
Yeah, okay.
The truth is...
I am Iron Man.
You got a family?
Yes, and I will see them when I leave here. And you, Stark?
No.
So you're a man who has everything... and nothing.
Iron Man. That's kind of catchy. It's got a nice ring to it. I mean it's not technically accurate. The suit's a gold titanium alloy, but it's kind of provocative, the imagery anyway.
We gotta go. Come on, move with me. We got a plan, and we're going to stick to it.
This was always the plan, Stark...
Come on, you're going to go see your family. Get up.
My family is dead, Stark... and I'm going to see them now. It's okay, I want this... I want this.
Thank you for saving me.
Don't waste it... don't waste your life, Stark.
Day 11, Test 37, Configuration 2.0. For lack of a better option, Dummy is still on fire safety.
If you douse me again, and I'm not on fire, I'm donating you to a city college. Seriously, we're just gonna start off with 1% thrust capacity. And three... two... one.
Please don't follow me around with it either because I feel like I'm going to catch on fire spontaneously. Just stand down. If something happens, then come in.
Tony, you know that I would help you with anything, but I cannot help you if you're going to start all this again.
There is nothing except this. There's no art opening, no charity, nothing to sign. There's the next mission, and nothing else.
Is that so? Well, then I quit.
You stood by my side all these years while I reaped the benefits of destruction. Now that I'm trying to protect the people I've put in harm's way, you're going to walk out?
You're going to kill yourself, Tony. I'm not going to be a part of it.
I shouldn't be alive... unless it was for a reason. I'm not crazy, Pepper. I just finally know what I have to do. And I know in my heart that it's right.
What is going on here?
Let's face it, this is not the worst thing you've caught me doing.
Are those bullet holes?
Am I making you uncomfortable?
Oh, no, I always forget to wear deodorant and dance with my boss in a room full of people I work with in a dress with no back.
Well, you look great, you smell great. But I could fire you if that would take the edge off.
I don't think you could tie your shoes without me.
I'd make it a week.
A week, really? What's your social security number?

Five...

Right, the other eight. Well, I have you for the other eight.

Nick Fury. Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.
Ah.
I'm here to talk to you about the Avenger Initiative.
Pepper, uh, how big are your hands?
What?
How big are your hands?
I don't understand why...
Get down here. I need you.
Mr. Stark! Christine Everheart, Vanity Fair magazine. Can I ask you a couple of questions?
She's cute.
She's alright.
Hi!
Hi.
Yeah. Okay, go.
You've been called the Da Vinci of our time. What do you say to that?
Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.
And what do you say to your other nickname, the Merchant of Death?
That's not bad. Let me guess... Berkeley?
Brown, actually.
Well, Ms. Brown. It's an imperfect world, but it's the only one we got. I guarantee you the day weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace, I'll start making bricks and beams for baby hospitals.
Rehearse that much?
Every night in front of the mirror before bedtime.
I can see that.
I'd like to show you firsthand.
All I'm looking for is a straight answer.
OK, here's a straight answer. My old man had a philosophy: peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy.
That's a great line, coming from a guy selling the sticks.
My father helped defeat Nazis. He worked on the Manhattan Project. A lot of people, including your professors at Brown, would call that being a hero.
And a lot of people would also call that war-profiteering.
Tell me, do you plan to report on the millions we've saved by advancing medical technology or kept from starvation with our intelli-crops? All those breakthroughs, military funding, honey.
Have you ever lost an hour of sleep in your life?
I'm be prepared to lose a few with you.
They say that the best weapon is the one you never have to fire. I respectfully disagree. I prefer the weapon you only have to fire once. That's how Dad did it, that's how America does it, and it's worked out pretty well so far. I present to you the newest in Stark Industries' Freedom line. Find an excuse to let one of these off the chain, and I personally guarantee, the bad guys won't even wanna come out of their caves. Ladies and gentlemen, for your consideration... the Jericho.
What are you trying to get rid of me for? You got plans?
As a matter of fact, I do.
I don't like it when you have plans.
I'm allowed to have plans on my birthday.
It's your birthday?
Yes.
I knew that. Already?
Yeah, isn't that strange? It's the same day as last year.
Well, get yourself something nice for me.
I already did.
Yeah? And?
Oh, it's very nice... very tasteful. Thank you, Mr. Stark.
You're welcome, Ms. Potts.
Oh, my God, you crazy son of a bitch! You owe me a plane, you know that, right?
Yeah, well, technically he hit me, so...
Hmmm. Your eyes are red. Tears for your long lost boss?
Tears of joy. I hate job hunting.
Yeah, well, vacation's over.
I feel like you're driving me to court martial. This is crazy. What did I do? I feel like you're gonna pull over and snuff me. What, you're not allowed to talk? Hey, Forrest!
We can talk, sir.
Oh, I see. So it's personal.
No, you intimidate them.
Good God, you're a woman! I honestly, I couldn't have called that. I mean, I would apologize, but isn't that what we're going for here? I thought of you as a soldier first.
I'm an airman.
Well, you have actually excellent bone structure there. I'm kinda having a hard time not looking at you now. Is that weird?
Okay now, the copper wire - you got it?
Yeah, I've got it.
Now pull it out, gently, and just make sure you don't touch the s...
AH! - i-i-i-des!
Sorry, I'm sorry!
Don't touch the sides, that's what I was trying to tell you before. Now, just gently pull that out, and whatever you do, don't pull out the...
The magnet at the end of it. See, that was it. You just...
What?
What I was trying to tell you - no, don't put it back in! Just put it over there, we have to hurry...
What's wrong?
Oh, nothing, I'm just going into cardiac arrest, because you...
*What*? I thought you said this was safe!
...just yanked it out like a trout!
Don't ever, ever, ever, ask me to do anything like that, ever again!
I don't have anyone but you.
We met, you know, in a technical conference in Bern.
I don't remember.
Of course not. If I had been that drunk, I wouldn't have been able to stand, let alone give a lecture on integrated circuits.
Yes. Shall I render using proposed specifications?
Thrill me.
The render is complete.
A little ostentatious, don't you think?
What was I thinking? You're usually so discreet.
Tell you what. Throw a little hotrod red in there.
Yes, that should help you keep a low profile. The render is complete.
Hey, I like it. Fabricate it. Paint it.
Commencing automated assembly. Estimated completion time is five hours.
Don't wait up for me, honey.
That's the coolest thing I've ever seen.
Not bad, huh?
Good boy...
If I were Iron Man, I'd have this girlfriend who knew my true identity. She'd be a wreck. She'd always be worrying I was going to die, yet so proud of the man I've become. She'd be wildly conflicted, which would only make her more crazy about me...
Okay, let's do this right. Start mark, half a meter and to the right. Dummy, look alive, you're on standby for fire safety. You, roll it. Activate hand controls... okay, we're gonna start off nice and easy. See if 10% thrust capacity achieves lift. In three... two... one...
Hey. Ow,Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah.
It is a tight fit sir.
Hey, Ah.
Sir the more you struggle the more this is going to hurt
Be gentle. This is my first time.
I designed this to come off, so... hey. I really should be able to...
Please, try not to move sir.
Whats going on here?
Lets face it. This is not the worst thing you've caught me doing.
Are those bullet holes?
Yeah, I can fly.
Test complete. Preparing to power down and begin diagnostics...
Uh, yeah, tell you what. Do a weather and ATC check, start listening in on ground control.
Sir, there are still terabytes of calculations required before an actual flight is...
Jarvis... sometimes you gotta run before you can walk.
Mr. Stark.
Yeah?
Agent Coulson.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, the guy from the...
Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division.
Whew! God, you really need a new name for that.
Yeah, I hear that a lot.
This looks important!
He wants you to build the Jericho missile. He has everything you need here, he wants you to begin immediately. After it is completed, he will set you free.
No, he won't.
No, he won't.
My turn.
I thought you said you were done making weapons?
It isn't. This is a flight stabilizer. It's completely harmless.
I didn't expect that.
Did you see that? Those are YOUR weapons... in the hands of those murderers! Is this what you want? Is this what you wish the legacy of the great Tony Stark to be?
I shouldn't do anything. They could kill you, they're gonna kill me, either way, and even if they don't, I'll probably be dead in a week.
Then this is a very important week for you, isn't it?
We have to hurry. Take this, take this...
Okay, okay...
Now you have to take this wire and attach it to the base plate, there.
Okay... Tony?
What?
Tony, it's gonna be okay.
Is it?
It's gonna be okay. I-I am gonna make this okay.
Let's hope.
YAAA-OOOOOW...!
Was that so hard? That was fun, right?
You are supposed to be halfway around the world by now.
How'd she take it?
Like a champ.
Why are you trying to hustle me out of here?
Your flight was scheduled to leave an hour and a half ago.
It's funny, I though with it being my plane and all that it would just wait for me.
Tony, I need to speak to you about a couple of things before I get you out...
I mean, doesn't it kind of defeat the whole purpose of having your own plane if it departs before you arrive?
To Peace.
Where'd you get that dress?
It was a birthday present... from you, actually.
I got great taste, don't I? You, uh, wanna dance?
Oh, no, thank you.
All right, come on.
Hello.
Hi, Rhodey, its me.
It's who?
Oh, I'm sorry, it is ME. You asked. What your asking about, it's me.
No, you see, this isn't a game. You do not send civilian equipment into my active war zone. You understand that?
It's not a piece of equipment, I'm in it! Its a suit! It's ME!
You're kidding me with the hand up, right?
Is it cool if I take a picture with you?
Yes, it's very cool.
I don't want to see this on your myspace page. Please no gang signs.
No, throw it up. I'm kidding. Yeah, peace. I love peace. I'd be out of a job for peace.
Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
Yes, that will be all, Miss. Potts.
What the hell did you do to me?
What I did is to save your life. That is an electromagnet, hooked up to a car battery. I removed as much shrapnel from your chest as I could, but there are still some pieces left. I've seen plenty of injuries like that. In my village we call those casualties ""the walking dead,"" because they take about a week to reach your heart.
What do you want me to do with this?
That? Destroy it. Incinerate it.
You don't want to keep it?
Pepper, I've been called many things. Nostalgic is not one of them.
That doesn't look like the Jericho missile.
That's because it is a miniaturized arc reactor. I've got a big one powering my factory at home.
What will it generate?
If my math is right - and it always is - three gigajoules per second.
That could run your heart for fifty lifetimes!
Yeah... or something big for fifteen minutes.
Tony! Remember me?
Sure don't.
Three hours! Three hours you've kept me standing here!
Waiting on you now.
I never got to say goodbye to my father. There's questions I would've asked him. I would've asked him how he felt about what his company did, if he was conflicted, if he ever had doubts. Or maybe he was every inch of man we remember from the newsreels. I saw young Americans killed by the very weapons I created to defend them and protect them. And I saw that I had become part of a system that is comfortable with zero-accountability.
Mr. Stark! What happened over there?
I had my eyes opened. I came to realize that I had more to offer this world than just making things that blow up. And that is why, effective immediately, I am shutting down the weapons manufacturing division of Stark Industries.
Give me a scotch. I'm starving.
I just want you to reach in, and gently lift the wire out.
Is it safe?
Yeah. It should be fine. It's just like Operation, just don't let it touch the socket.
What do you mean, Operation?
It's just a game, never mind. Just gently lift the wire, okay? All right...
You know, I... uh... I don't think that I'm qualified to do that.
No, no. You're fine. You are the most capable, qualified, trustworthy person I've ever met, you'll do great. Is it too much to ask? 'Cause I really need your help here.
Is this what you call accountability?
When were these taken?
Yesterday.
I didn't authorize this.
Well, your company did.
Well I'm not my company!
What's better, winning all that money or not caring about it?
Hey Tony.
I'm sorry. This is the fun-vee. The hum-drum-vee is back there.
What the hell is that noise?
I'm driving with the top down.
Well, I need your help right now.
Funny how that works, huh?
Yeah. Speaking of funny, we got a weapons depot that was just blown up a few klicks from where you were being held.
Well, I'd say that's a hot spot. Sounds...
...sounds like someone stepped in and did your job for you.
Why do you sound out of breath?
I'm not. I was just jogging in the canyon.
I thought you were driving.
Right, I was driving... to the canyon... where I'm gonna jog.
You sure you don't have any tech in that area I should know about?
Nope.
Good, because I'm looking at something right now and we're about to blow it to kingdom come.
Oh... ah... EWW, there's pus!
It's not pus. It's an inorganic plasmic discharge. It's from the device, not my body.
It smells!
Yeah, it does.
Well, Tony Stark!
Oh, hey.
Fancy seeing you here.
Carrie.
Christine.
That's right.
You have a lot of nerve showing up here tonight. Can I at least get a reaction from you?
Panic. I would say panic is my reaction.
I was referring to your company's involvement in this latest atrocity.
Yeah, they just put my name on the invitation, I don't know what to tell you.
Tony, you have to go to the hospital. The doctor has to look at you.
I don't have to do anything. I've been in captivity for three months. There are two things I want to do. One, I want an American cheeseburger, and the other...
That's enough of that.
It's not what you think. I want you to call for a press conference.
Call for a press conference? What on earth for?
Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first.
Okay, this is where I don't want to be.
Not bad.
Looking great, Hef.
Why aren't you wearing those pajamas I got you?
Good night, Tony...
Is it true that you went twelve-for-twelve with the Maxim Girls last year?
That is an excellent question. Yes and no. March and I had a scheduling conflict but fortunately the Christmas cover was twins.
Whatcha readin'... platypus?
Nothin'.
Come on sour patch.
I told you I'm not sour...
...don't be mad...
...i'm not mad, i'm indifferent, ok.
I said I was sorry.
You don't need to apologize to me cause I'm not mad.
Good morning Mr. Stark.
Hi, I said I was sorry.
...i'm just indifferent right now.
Hot towel?
You don't respect yourself so I know you don't respect me...
...I respect you...
...so I'm just your baby sitter. so when you need your diaper changed
thank you
let me know and I'll get you a bottle, ok?
Hey! Heat up the saki will ya? Thanks for reminding me.
I'm not talkin about a... we're not drinking we're working right now.
You are institutionally incapable of being responsible.
It would be irresponsible NOT to drink. I'm just talking about a night cap here.
Hot saki?
Yes, 2 please.
No... just... I'm not drinking. I don't want any.
That's what I'm talking about, when I get up in the morning and I'm puttin on my uniform you know what I recognize? I see in the mirror that every person with this uniform on, GOT MY BACK!
you know, i'm not... i'm not... like you... aren't you just a little distracted right now?
you don't have to be like me, but you can be more and you just don't see it. No I can't be distracted right now!
Attitude control is a little sluggish above 15,000 meters, I'm guessing icing is the probable cause.
A very astute observation, sir. Perhaps, if you intend to visit other planets, we should improve the exosystems.
Connect to the sys. co. Have it reconfigure the shell metals. Use the gold titanium alloy from the seraphim tactical satellite. That should ensure a fuselage integrity while while maintaining power-to-weight ratio. Got it?
Sheesh o besh.
Good roll.
We're gonna let it ride! Give me a hand, will you? Give me a little something-something.
Okay, you too.
I don't blow on a man's dice.
Come on, honey bear.
There it is. Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes rolls! And...
Two craps. Line away.
That's what happens.
Worse things have happened.
I thought I lost you back there!
You did, sir.
I would like a vodka martini, please.
Okay.
Very dry, with olives, a lot of olives. Like, at least three olives.
Two vodka martinis, extra dry, extra olives, extra... fast.
How'd it go?
Oh, that bad, huh?
Just because I brought pizza back from New York doesn't mean it went bad.
I got stuck doing a piece for Vanity Fair.
Gimme a gun! Gimme a gun!
Okay, let's see what this thing can do. What's SR-71's record?
The altitude record for fixed wing flight is 85,000 feet, sir.
Records are made to be broken! Come on!
I think you got a lot of my weapons.
There's been speculation that I was involved in the events that occurred on the freeway and the rooftop...
I'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you honestly expect us to believe that that was a bodyguard in a suit that conveniently appeared, despite the fact that...
I know that it's confusing. It is one thing to question the official story, and another thing entirely to make wild accusations, or insinuate that I'm a superhero.
I never said you were a superhero.
Didn't?
Mmm-mmm.
Well, good, because that would be outlandish and, uh, fantastic. I'm just not the hero type. Clearly. With this laundry list of character defects, all the mistakes I've made, largely public.
Just stick to the cards, man.
Yeah, okay.
The truth is...
I am Iron Man.
You got a family?
Yes, and I will see them when I leave here. And you, Stark?
No.
So you're a man who has everything... and nothing.
Iron Man. That's kind of catchy. It's got a nice ring to it. I mean it's not technically accurate. The suit's a gold titanium alloy, but it's kind of provocative, the imagery anyway.
We gotta go. Come on, move with me. We got a plan, and we're going to stick to it.
This was always the plan, Stark...
Come on, you're going to go see your family. Get up.
My family is dead, Stark... and I'm going to see them now. It's okay, I want this... I want this.
Thank you for saving me.
Don't waste it... don't waste your life, Stark.
Day 11, Test 37, Configuration 2.0. For lack of a better option, Dummy is still on fire safety.
If you douse me again, and I'm not on fire, I'm donating you to a city college. Seriously, we're just gonna start off with 1% thrust capacity. And three... two... one.
Please don't follow me around with it either because I feel like I'm going to catch on fire spontaneously. Just stand down. If something happens, then come in.
Tony, you know that I would help you with anything, but I cannot help you if you're going to start all this again.
There is nothing except this. There's no art opening, no charity, nothing to sign. There's the next mission, and nothing else.
Is that so? Well, then I quit.
You stood by my side all these years while I reaped the benefits of destruction. Now that I'm trying to protect the people I've put in harm's way, you're going to walk out?
You're going to kill yourself, Tony. I'm not going to be a part of it.
I shouldn't be alive... unless it was for a reason. I'm not crazy, Pepper. I just finally know what I have to do. And I know in my heart that it's right.
What is going on here?
Let's face it, this is not the worst thing you've caught me doing.
Are those bullet holes?
Am I making you uncomfortable?
Oh, no, I always forget to wear deodorant and dance with my boss in a room full of people I work with in a dress with no back.
Well, you look great, you smell great. But I could fire you if that would take the edge off.
I don't think you could tie your shoes without me.
I'd make it a week.
A week, really? What's your social security number?

Five...
""Five?"" You're missing just a couple of digits.
Right, the other eight. Well, I have you for the other eight.
Evening, JARVIS!
Welcome home, sir...
""I am Iron Man"". You think you're the only superhero in the world? Mr. Stark, you've become part of a bigger universe. You just don't know it yet.
Who the hell are you?
Nick Fury. Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

I'm here to talk to you about the Avenger Initiative.

No, throw it up. I'm kidding. Yeah, peace. I love peace. I'd be out of a job for peace.
Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
Yes, that will be all, Miss. Potts.
What the hell did you do to me?
What I did is to save your life. That is an electromagnet, hooked up to a car battery. I removed as much shrapnel from your chest as I could, but there are still some pieces left. I've seen plenty of injuries like that. In my village we call those casualties ""the walking dead,"" because they take about a week to reach your heart.
What do you want me to do with this?
That? Destroy it. Incinerate it.
You don't want to keep it?
Pepper, I've been called many things. Nostalgic is not one of them.
That doesn't look like the Jericho missile.
That's because it is a miniaturized arc reactor. I've got a big one powering my factory at home.
What will it generate?
If my math is right - and it always is - three gigajoules per second.
That could run your heart for fifty lifetimes!
Yeah... or something big for fifteen minutes.
Tony! Remember me?
Sure don't.
Three hours! Three hours you've kept me standing here!
Waiting on you now.
I never got to say goodbye to my father. There's questions I would've asked him. I would've asked him how he felt about what his company did, if he was conflicted, if he ever had doubts. Or maybe he was every inch of man we remember from the newsreels. I saw young Americans killed by the very weapons I created to defend them and protect them. And I saw that I had become part of a system that is comfortable with zero-accountability.
Mr. Stark! What happened over there?
I had my eyes opened. I came to realize that I had more to offer this world than just making things that blow up. And that is why, effective immediately, I am shutting down the weapons manufacturing division of Stark Industries.
Give me a scotch. I'm starving.
I just want you to reach in, and gently lift the wire out.
Is it safe?
Yeah. It should be fine. It's just like Operation, just don't let it touch the socket.
What do you mean, Operation?
It's just a game, never mind. Just gently lift the wire, okay? All right...
You know, I... uh... I don't think that I'm qualified to do that.
No, no. You're fine. You are the most capable, qualified, trustworthy person I've ever met, you'll do great. Is it too much to ask? 'Cause I really need your help here.
Is this what you call accountability?
When were these taken?
Yesterday.
I didn't authorize this.
Well, your company did.
Well I'm not my company!
What's better, winning all that money or not caring about it?
Hey Tony.
I'm sorry. This is the fun-vee. The hum-drum-vee is back there.
What the hell is that noise?
I'm driving with the top down.
Well, I need your help right now.
Funny how that works, huh?
Yeah. Speaking of funny, we got a weapons depot that was just blown up a few klicks from where you were being held.
Well, I'd say that's a hot spot. Sounds...
...sounds like someone stepped in and did your job for you.
Why do you sound out of breath?
I'm not. I was just jogging in the canyon.
I thought you were driving.
Right, I was driving... to the canyon... where I'm gonna jog.
You sure you don't have any tech in that area I should know about?
Nope.
Good, because I'm looking at something right now and we're about to blow it to kingdom come.
Oh... ah... EWW, there's pus!
It's not pus. It's an inorganic plasmic discharge. It's from the device, not my body.
It smells!
Yeah, it does.
Well, Tony Stark!
Oh, hey.
Fancy seeing you here.
Carrie.
Christine.
That's right.
You have a lot of nerve showing up here tonight. Can I at least get a reaction from you?
Panic. I would say panic is my reaction.
I was referring to your company's involvement in this latest atrocity.
Yeah, they just put my name on the invitation, I don't know what to tell you.
Tony, you have to go to the hospital. The doctor has to look at you.
I don't have to do anything. I've been in captivity for three months. There are two things I want to do. One, I want an American cheeseburger, and the other...
That's enough of that.
It's not what you think. I want you to call for a press conference.
Call for a press conference? What on earth for?
Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first.
Okay, this is where I don't want to be.
Not bad.
Looking great, Hef.
Why aren't you wearing those pajamas I got you?
Good night, Tony...
Is it true that you went twelve-for-twelve with the Maxim Girls last year?
That is an excellent question. Yes and no. March and I had a scheduling conflict but fortunately the Christmas cover was twins.
Whatcha readin'... platypus?
Nothin'.
Come on sour patch.
I told you I'm not sour...
...don't be mad...
...i'm not mad, i'm indifferent, ok.
I said I was sorry.
You don't need to apologize to me cause I'm not mad.
Good morning Mr. Stark.
Hi, I said I was sorry.
...i'm just indifferent right now.
Hot towel?
You don't respect yourself so I know you don't respect me...
...I respect you...
...so I'm just your baby sitter. so when you need your diaper changed
thank you
let me know and I'll get you a bottle, ok?
Hey! Heat up the saki will ya? Thanks for reminding me.
I'm not talkin about a... we're not drinking we're working right now.
You are institutionally incapable of being responsible.
It would be irresponsible NOT to drink. I'm just talking about a night cap here.
Hot saki?
Yes, 2 please.
No... just... I'm not drinking. I don't want any.
That's what I'm talking about, when I get up in the morning and I'm puttin on my uniform you know what I recognize? I see in the mirror that every person with this uniform on, GOT MY BACK!
you know, i'm not... i'm not... like you... aren't you just a little distracted right now?
you don't have to be like me, but you can be more and you just don't see it. No I can't be distracted right now!
Attitude control is a little sluggish above 15,000 meters, I'm guessing icing is the probable cause.
A very astute observation, sir. Perhaps, if you intend to visit other planets, we should improve the exosystems.
Connect to the sys. co. Have it reconfigure the shell metals. Use the gold titanium alloy from the seraphim tactical satellite. That should ensure a fuselage integrity while while maintaining power-to-weight ratio. Got it?
Sheesh o besh.
Good roll.
We're gonna let it ride! Give me a hand, will you? Give me a little something-something.
Okay, you too.
I don't blow on a man's dice.
Come on, honey bear.
There it is. Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes rolls! And...
Two craps. Line away.
That's what happens.
Worse things have happened.
I thought I lost you back there!
You did, sir.
I would like a vodka martini, please.
Okay.
Very dry, with olives, a lot of olives. Like, at least three olives.
Two vodka martinis, extra dry, extra olives, extra... fast.
How'd it go?
Oh, that bad, huh?
Just because I brought pizza back from New York doesn't mean it went bad.
I got stuck doing a piece for Vanity Fair.
Gimme a gun! Gimme a gun!
Okay, let's see what this thing can do. What's SR-71's record?
The altitude record for fixed wing flight is 85,000 feet, sir.
Records are made to be broken! Come on!
I think you got a lot of my weapons.
There's been speculation that I was involved in the events that occurred on the freeway and the rooftop...
I'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you honestly expect us to believe that that was a bodyguard in a suit that conveniently appeared, despite the fact that...
I know that it's confusing. It is one thing to question the official story, and another thing entirely to make wild accusations, or insinuate that I'm a superhero.
I never said you were a superhero.
Didn't?
Mmm-mmm.
Well, good, because that would be outlandish and, uh, fantastic. I'm just not the hero type. Clearly. With this laundry list of character defects, all the mistakes I've made, largely public.
Just stick to the cards, man.
Yeah, okay.
The truth is...
I am Iron Man.
You got a family?
Yes, and I will see them when I leave here. And you, Stark?
No.
So you're a man who has everything... and nothing.
Iron Man. That's kind of catchy. It's got a nice ring to it. I mean it's not technically accurate. The suit's a gold titanium alloy, but it's kind of provocative, the imagery anyway.
We gotta go. Come on, move with me. We got a plan, and we're going to stick to it.
This was always the plan, Stark...
Come on, you're going to go see your family. Get up.
My family is dead, Stark... and I'm going to see them now. It's okay, I want this... I want this.
Thank you for saving me.
Don't waste it... don't waste your life, Stark.
Day 11, Test 37, Configuration 2.0. For lack of a better option, Dummy is still on fire safety.
If you douse me again, and I'm not on fire, I'm donating you to a city college. Seriously, we're just gonna start off with 1% thrust capacity. And three... two... one.
Please don't follow me around with it either because I feel like I'm going to catch on fire spontaneously. Just stand down. If something happens, then come in.
Tony, you know that I would help you with anything, but I cannot help you if you're going to start all this again.
There is nothing except this. There's no art opening, no charity, nothing to sign. There's the next mission, and nothing else.
Is that so? Well, then I quit.
You stood by my side all these years while I reaped the benefits of destruction. Now that I'm trying to protect the people I've put in harm's way, you're going to walk out?
You're going to kill yourself, Tony. I'm not going to be a part of it.
I shouldn't be alive... unless it was for a reason. I'm not crazy, Pepper. I just finally know what I have to do. And I know in my heart that it's right.
What is going on here?
Let's face it, this is not the worst thing you've caught me doing.
Are those bullet holes?
Am I making you uncomfortable?
Oh, no, I always forget to wear deodorant and dance with my boss in a room full of people I work with in a dress with no back.
Well, you look great, you smell great. But I could fire you if that would take the edge off.
I don't think you could tie your shoes without me.
I'd make it a week.
A week, really? What's your social security number?

Five...
""Five?"" You're missing just a couple of digits.
Right, the other eight. Well, I have you for the other eight.
Evening, JARVIS!
Welcome home, sir...
""I am Iron Man"". You think you're the only superhero in the world? Mr. Stark, you've become part of a bigger universe. You just don't know it yet.
Who the hell are you?
Nick Fury. Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.
Ah.
I'm here to talk to you about the Avenger Initiative.
Pepper, uh, how big are your hands?
What?
How big are your hands?
I don't understand why...
Get down here. I need you.
Mr. Stark! Christine Everheart, Vanity Fair magazine. Can I ask you a couple of questions?
She's cute.
She's alright.
Hi!
Hi.
Yeah. Okay, go.
You've been called the Da Vinci of our time. What do you say to that?
Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.
And what do you say to your other nickname, the Merchant of Death?
That's not bad. Let me guess... Berkeley?
Brown, actually.
Well, Ms. Brown. It's an imperfect world, but it's the only one we got. I guarantee you the day weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace, I'll start making bricks and beams for baby hospitals.
Rehearse that much?
Every night in front of the mirror before bedtime.
I can see that.
I'd like to show you firsthand.
All I'm looking for is a straight answer.
OK, here's a straight answer. My old man had a philosophy: peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy.
That's a great line, coming from a guy selling the sticks.
My father helped defeat Nazis. He worked on the Manhattan Project. A lot of people, including your professors at Brown, would call that being a hero.
And a lot of people would also call that war-profiteering.
Tell me, do you plan to report on the millions we've saved by advancing medical technology or kept from starvation with our intelli-crops? All those breakthroughs, military funding, honey.
Have you ever lost an hour of sleep in your life?
I'm be prepared to lose a few with you.
They say that the best weapon is the one you never have to fire. I respectfully disagree. I prefer the weapon you only have to fire once. That's how Dad did it, that's how America does it, and it's worked out pretty well so far. I present to you the newest in Stark Industries' Freedom line. Find an excuse to let one of these off the chain, and I personally guarantee, the bad guys won't even wanna come out of their caves. Ladies and gentlemen, for your consideration... the Jericho.
What are you trying to get rid of me for? You got plans?
As a matter of fact, I do.
I don't like it when you have plans.
I'm allowed to have plans on my birthday.
It's your birthday?
Yes.
I knew that. Already?
Yeah, isn't that strange? It's the same day as last year.
Well, get yourself something nice for me.
I already did.
Yeah? And?
Oh, it's very nice... very tasteful. Thank you, Mr. Stark.
You're welcome, Ms. Potts.
Oh, my God, you crazy son of a bitch! You owe me a plane, you know that, right?
Yeah, well, technically he hit me, so...
Hmmm. Your eyes are red. Tears for your long lost boss?
Tears of joy. I hate job hunting.
Yeah, well, vacation's over.
I feel like you're driving me to court martial. This is crazy. What did I do? I feel like you're gonna pull over and snuff me. What, you're not allowed to talk? Hey, Forrest!
We can talk, sir.
Oh, I see. So it's personal.
No, you intimidate them.
Good God, you're a woman! I honestly, I couldn't have called that. I mean, I would apologize, but isn't that what we're going for here? I thought of you as a soldier first.
I'm an airman.
Well, you have actually excellent bone structure there. I'm kinda having a hard time not looking at you now. Is that weird?
Okay now, the copper wire - you got it?
Yeah, I've got it.
Now pull it out, gently, and just make sure you don't touch the s...
AH! - i-i-i-des!
Sorry, I'm sorry!
Don't touch the sides, that's what I was trying to tell you before. Now, just gently pull that out, and whatever you do, don't pull out the...
The magnet at the end of it. See, that was it. You just...
What?
What I was trying to tell you - no, don't put it back in! Just put it over there, we have to hurry...
What's wrong?
Oh, nothing, I'm just going into cardiac arrest, because you...
*What*? I thought you said this was safe!
...just yanked it out like a trout!
Don't ever, ever, ever, ask me to do anything like that, ever again!
I don't have anyone but you.
We met, you know, in a technical conference in Bern.
I don't remember.
Of course not. If I had been that drunk, I wouldn't have been able to stand, let alone give a lecture on integrated circuits.
Yes. Shall I render using proposed specifications?
Thrill me.
The render is complete.
A little ostentatious, don't you think?
What was I thinking? You're usually so discreet.
Tell you what. Throw a little hotrod red in there.
Yes, that should help you keep a low profile. The render is complete.
Hey, I like it. Fabricate it. Paint it.
Commencing automated assembly. Estimated completion time is five hours.
Don't wait up for me, honey.
That's the coolest thing I've ever seen.
Not bad, huh?
Good boy...
If I were Iron Man, I'd have this girlfriend who knew my true identity. She'd be a wreck. She'd always be worrying I was going to die, yet so proud of the man I've become. She'd be wildly conflicted, which would only make her more crazy about me...
Okay, let's do this right. Start mark, half a meter and to the right. Dummy, look alive, you're on standby for fire safety. You, roll it. Activate hand controls... okay, we're gonna start off nice and easy. See if 10% thrust capacity achieves lift. In three... two... one...
Hey. Ow,Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah.
It is a tight fit sir.
Hey, Ah.
Sir the more you struggle the more this is going to hurt
Be gentle. This is my first time.
I designed this to come off, so... hey. I really should be able to...
Please, try not to move sir.
Whats going on here?
Lets face it. This is not the worst thing you've caught me doing.
Are those bullet holes?
Yeah, I can fly.
Test complete. Preparing to power down and begin diagnostics...
Uh, yeah, tell you what. Do a weather and ATC check, start listening in on ground control.
Sir, there are still terabytes of calculations required before an actual flight is...
Jarvis... sometimes you gotta run before you can walk.
Mr. Stark.
Yeah?
Agent Coulson.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, the guy from the...
Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division.
Whew! God, you really need a new name for that.
Yeah, I hear that a lot.
This looks important!
He wants you to build the Jericho missile. He has everything you need here, he wants you to begin immediately. After it is completed, he will set you free.
No, he won't.
No, he won't.
My turn.
I thought you said you were done making weapons?
It isn't. This is a flight stabilizer. It's completely harmless.
I didn't expect that.
Did you see that? Those are YOUR weapons... in the hands of those murderers! Is this what you want? Is this what you wish the legacy of the great Tony Stark to be?
I shouldn't do anything. They could kill you, they're gonna kill me, either way, and even if they don't, I'll probably be dead in a week.
Then this is a very important week for you, isn't it?
We have to hurry. Take this, take this...
Okay, okay...
Now you have to take this wire and attach it to the base plate, there.
Okay... Tony?
What?
Tony, it's gonna be okay.
Is it?
It's gonna be okay. I-I am gonna make this okay.
Let's hope.
YAAA-OOOOOW...!
Was that so hard? That was fun, right?
You are supposed to be halfway around the world by now.
How'd she take it?
Like a champ.
Why are you trying to hustle me out of here?
Your flight was scheduled to leave an hour and a half ago.
It's funny, I though with it being my plane and all that it would just wait for me.
Tony, I need to speak to you about a couple of things before I get you out...
I mean, doesn't it kind of defeat the whole purpose of having your own plane if it departs before you arrive?
To Peace.
Where'd you get that dress?
It was a birthday present... from you, actually.
I got great taste, don't I? You, uh, wanna dance?
Oh, no, thank you.
All right, come on.
Hello.
Hi, Rhodey, its me.
It's who?
Oh, I'm sorry, it is ME. You asked. What your asking about, it's me.
No, you see, this isn't a game. You do not send civilian equipment into my active war zone. You understand that?
It's not a piece of equipment, I'm in it! Its a suit! It's ME!
You're kidding me with the hand up, right?
Is it cool if I take a picture with you?
Yes, it's very cool.
I don't want to see this on your myspace page. Please no gang signs.
No, throw it up. I'm kidding. Yeah, peace. I love peace. I'd be out of a job for peace.
Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
Yes, that will be all, Miss. Potts.
What the hell did you do to me?
What I did is to save your life. That is an electromagnet, hooked up to a car battery. I removed as much shrapnel from your chest as I could, but there are still some pieces left. I've seen plenty of injuries like that. In my village we call those casualties ""the walking dead,"" because they take about a week to reach your heart.
What do you want me to do with this?
That? Destroy it. Incinerate it.
You don't want to keep it?
Pepper, I've been called many things. Nostalgic is not one of them.
That doesn't look like the Jericho missile.
That's because it is a miniaturized arc reactor. I've got a big one powering my factory at home.
What will it generate?
If my math is right - and it always is - three gigajoules per second.
That could run your heart for fifty lifetimes!
Yeah... or something big for fifteen minutes.
Tony! Remember me?
Sure don't.
Three hours! Three hours you've kept me standing here!
Waiting on you now.
I never got to say goodbye to my father. There's questions I would've asked him. I would've asked him how he felt about what his company did, if he was conflicted, if he ever had doubts. Or maybe he was every inch of man we remember from the newsreels. I saw young Americans killed by the very weapons I created to defend them and protect them. And I saw that I had become part of a system that is comfortable with zero-accountability.
Mr. Stark! What happened over there?
I had my eyes opened. I came to realize that I had more to offer this world than just making things that blow up. And that is why, effective immediately, I am shutting down the weapons manufacturing division of Stark Industries.

It's just a game, never mind. Just gently lift the wire, okay? All right...
You know, I... uh... I don't think that I'm qualified to do that.
No, no. You're fine. You are the most capable, qualified, trustworthy person I've ever met, you'll do great. Is it too much to ask? 'Cause I really need your help here.
Is this what you call accountability?
When were these taken?
Yesterday.
I didn't authorize this.
Well, your company did.
Well I'm not my company!
What's better, winning all that money or not caring about it?

We'll be at this all day.
Ah. The bedroom, Mina. Does it give you memories? Or ideas?
Ideas.
If that had been permanent, I'd have been very upset!
What are you?
I'm complicated.
I'm an immortal, sir, not a gazelle. How can we outrun this?
Care for a spin?
You could stay, you know. Share my dream.
I've lived long enough to see the future become history, Professor. Empires crumble. There are no exceptions.
You think you're better than me. You forget: I've seen your painting.
To that end, I set my wolf among you sheep.
Growl.
Mina. You're alive.
It's possible I can't die. Same could be said of you. Let's put it to the test.
Do you realize what you've done? What you've let out of me?

Jekyll, come on! We'll need Hyde!
No! Hyde will never use me again.

And you don't miss a thing, do you, Mr. Quatermain?
Oh, sometimes.
OW. You scratched me.
Better me than him.

Not Skinner - me!

I don't like to boast.
Oh, scotch anyone?
Help yourself.
Don't let it ruin your makeup.
I'm impressed, Mr. Gray. You take Skinner's uniqueness in your stride.
Well, I've seen too much in my life to shock easily.
Hello, Dorian. The great white hunter's bagged his prize.
Or the prize bagged him.
Stay back, if you value your lives.
Quite the parlor trick.
Wait 'til you see my next one.
Dr.Jekyll... at your service.
I hoped I'd get to nail you one more time. Didn't think it'd be literally.
We'll be at this all day.
Ah. The bedroom, Mina. Does it give you memories? Or ideas?
Ideas.
If that had been permanent, I'd have been very upset!
What are you?
I'm complicated.
I'm an immortal, sir, not a gazelle. How can we outrun this?
Care for a spin?
You could stay, you know. Share my dream.
I've lived long enough to see the future become history, Professor. Empires crumble. There are no exceptions.
You think you're better than me. You forget: I've seen your painting.
To that end, I set my wolf among you sheep.
Growl.
Mina. You're alive.
It's possible I can't die. Same could be said of you. Let's put it to the test.
Do you realize what you've done? What you've let out of me?
A woman's wrath? Oh, I'm petrified.
Bomb-voyage.
Jekyll, come on! We'll need Hyde!
No! Hyde will never use me again.
Then what good are you?
Ah, you're missing a picture, Mr. Gray.
And you don't miss a thing, do you, Mr. Quatermain?
Oh, sometimes.
OW. You scratched me.
Better me than him.
That Skinner's got a lot to answer for!
Not Skinner - me!
And I thought I was special. You're invulnerable to harm.
I don't like to boast.
Oh, scotch anyone?
Help yourself.
Don't let it ruin your makeup.

"John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester","K, L","Byronic Hero, Casanova","Allow me to be frank at the commencement. You will not like me. The gentlemen will be envious and the ladies will be repelled. You will not like me now and you will like me a good deal less as we go on. Ladies, an announcement: I am up for it, all the time. That is not a boast or an opinion, it is bone hard medical fact. I put it round you know. And you will watch me putting it round and sigh for it. Don't. It is a deal of trouble for you and you are better off watching and drawing your conclusions from a distance than you would be if I got my tarse up your petticoats. Gentlemen. Do not despair, I am up for that as well. And the same warning applies. Still your cheesy erections till I have had my say. But later when you shag - and later you will shag, I shall expect it of you and I will know if you have let me down - I wish you to shag with my homuncular image rattling in your gonads. Feel how it was for me, how it is for me and ponder. 'Was that shudder the same shudder he sensed? Did he know something more profound? Or is there some wall of wretchedness that we all batter with our heads at that shining, livelong moment. That is it. That is my prologue, nothing in rhyme, no protestations of modesty, you were not expecting that I hope. I am John Wilmot, Second Earl of Rochester and I do not want you to like me.
All men would be cowards if they only had the courage.
This is your first season on the London stage?
It is, my lord.
Mrs. Barry, you must acquire the trick of ignoring those who do not like you. In my experience, those who do not like you fall into two categories: The stupid and the envious. The stupid will like you in five years time. The envious, never.
Did you miss me?
I missed the money.
Good. I don't like a whore with sentiment.
But life is not a succession of urgent ""nows"". It's a listless trickle of ""why should I's"".
If god wants men to have faith, why does he not make us more disposed to believe?
Most men are so disposed.
But not me.
This fellow is my servant. He has just filched two shillings from my coat pocket.
A thief and a rogue.
My lord, you express it.
Haven't quite got the hang of the reign yet, have you?
I will not employ a thief.
Then I will.
How much was your master paying you?
Six shillings a week, sir.
Who talks of thieving?
My lord, Alice Twoumy has sent word. Her child is sick and she shan't come.
What was to be her role?
She was playing ""Little Clitoris.""
Of course. Alcock! This is your moment. You will stand in for her.
No, my lord.
I beg your pardon?
I'm Alcock. ""Little Clitoris"" is beyond my range.
So here he lies at the last. The deathbed convert. The pious debauchee. Could not dance a half measure, could I? Give me wine, I drain the dregs and toss the empty bottle at the world. Show me our Lord Jesus in agony and I mount the cross and steal his nails for my own palms. There I go, shuffling from the world. My dribble fresh upon the bible. I look upon a pinhead and I see angels dancing. Well? Do you like me now? Do you like me now? Do you like me now? Do you like me... now?
I wish to be moved. I cannot feel in life. I must have others do it for me here in the theatre.
You are spoken of as a man with a stomach for life.
I am the cynic of our golden age. This bounteous dish, which our great Charles and our great God have more or less in equal measure placed before us, sets my teeth permanently on edge. Life has no purpose. It is everywhere undone by arbitrariness. I do this and it matters not a jot if I do the opposite. But in the playhouse every action, good or bad, has it's consequences. Drop a handkerchief and it will return to smother you. The theatre is my drug. And my illness is so far advanced that my physic must be of the highest quality.
My lord, on these conditions, I endeavour to do what you want.
How old are you, Mr Downs?
Eighteen, my lord.
Young man, you will die of this company. Do not laugh, I'm serious.
And yet you do not draw the moral of the incident.
Which is?
That any experiment of interest in life will be carried out at your own expense. Mark it well.
Ah, to die onstage at the hands of a beautiful woman.
I am no such!
When I wake in the country, I dream of being in London. When I get here, it's full of people like you.
Well freeze my piss if the royal finger ain't beckoning me. How exciting.
I don't mean to upset people, but I must speak my mind. For what's in my mind is far more interesting than what's outside my mind.
Makes you impossible to live with, though. You see?
Did I once praise you for your blunt manner?
It was your reason for employing me.
It could as easy be your grounds for dismissal.
The entire piece has been devised with the French in mind. In France, fornication in the streets with total strangers is *compulsory*.
I shall never forgive you for teaching me how to love life.
I handed you a chance to show your shining talent and what do you give me in return? A pornographic representation of a royal court where the men only deal in buggery and the women's sole object of interest is the dildo!
A monument to your reign!
Give you your first London spurt of the summer.
I brought the wife with me.
Bit of a waste shooting good jism up the lawful.
What is your name?
Alcock.
Like master, like servant.
Your father spirited me out of England when my life was at stake, so I looked after him and after you.
You put me in the Tower.
And I let you out. The time has come for you to pay your dues. People listen to you, Johnny. If you took your seat in the Lords, you could make great speeches that would influence events. Anyone can oppose, it's fun to be against things, but there comes a time when you have to start being for things as well.
You abducted me in a coach like this when I was still a virgin heiress.
And did you like abduction?
Passionately.
That would not be appropriate for a man of breeding.
If you had ever loved a man, you would say that speech with regret because you would fear the loss of him.
And supposing I have loved?
Then show me in the speech.
I am come to train you... in your acting.
So you said when we first met, but your reputation being what it is, I thought you meant something different.
I have, I hope, many reputations.
I love London. Everyone catches its generous spirit so quickly.
""And wit was his vain frivolous pretence of pleasing others, at his own expense.""
You are one of life's understudies!
My lord!
I asked for no interruption.
My suit is one of the utmost urgency: the stage direction at the end of this scene requires, in my opinion, some authorial exposition.
It seems straightforward enough.
Yes, um,
""Then dance six naked men and women, the men doing obedience to the women's cunts, kissing and touching them often, the women in like manner to the men's pricks, kissing and dandling their cods and then fall to fucking, after which the women sigh and the men look simple and so sneak off."" The end of the second act.
A strong scene, an eminently playable scene, and though I say it myself, a climactic one.
And w-will the kind of equipment that that young lady has in her hand
be available for gentlemen for... strapping around the middle for the execution of this scene?
I had not envisioned you to be so encumbered; I feel this scene should be given... in the flesh.
And will we give... two performances on the day?
No, Mr. Harris.
I am glad to hear that from the author.
With the dress rehearsal, the court performance and the public showing, I envisage three.
Right; I don't know if you've met my regular understudy, Mr. Lightman, he's a most dependable fellow.
Sir, you have the honour of playing *my* understudy.
Well, I shall take this opportunity to withdraw from the engagement.
You are one of *life's* understudies!
I wish to be moved. I cannot feel in life. I must have others do it for me in theater.
I told you.
Johnny, you finally did something for me.
I didn't do it for you, I did it for me.
Ink! Ink! Bring me ink!
Not drink, lump! Ink!
Anyone can drink.
Not many can match my determination.
I never wanted you for a mistress, Lizzy. I wanted you for my wife.
Oh, written a new play has he? All those afternoons pretending to slope of and roger his mistress, like a decent chap, he was lurking in his rooms poking away at a play. That is disgusting, George.
Give me a major work of literature and I'll give you 500 guineas.
When would you like it? Friday?
I am nature. you are art. Let us see how we compare.
The theatre is my drug, and my illness is so far advanced that my physic must be of the highest quality.
There is spirit in her.
When a gent sees the spirit, and not the eyes or the tits, then a gent is in trouble.
I can't get money out of Louis unless I dissolve Parliament, and I can't get money out of Parliament unless I fight Louis.
Well, choose.
I need money from both of them.
Is the fault mine? If I were a better wife would you not need the whorehouse and the inn?
Every man needs the whorehouse and the inn.
Allow me to be frank at the commencement. You will not like me. The gentlemen will be envious and the ladies will be repelled.

Do excuse me while I kill the man who ruined my life.
Be my guest.
Let us examine that claim for a moment, former Commodore, shall we? Who was it that, at the very moment you had a notorious pirate safely behind bars, saw fit to free said pirate and take your dearly beloved all to hisself, eh? So whose fault is it *really* that you've ended up a rum-pot deckhand what takes orders from pirates?
ENOUGH!
Unfortunately Mr. Turner, he's right!
We're not getting out of this.
Not with the chest. Into the boat.
You're mad.
Don't wait for me.
Uh, I say we respect his final wish.
It's real!
You actually were telling the truth.
I do that quite a lot. Yet people are always surprised.
With good reason.
Come on, then! Who wants some? Form an orderly line, I'll have you all one by one. Come on, who's first?
I just wanted the pleasure of doing that myself!
So am I worthy to serve under Captain Jack Sparrow...
... or should I just kill you now?
You're hired!
Sorry. Old habits and all that.
Your bravery is wasted. I shall pry the chest away from your cold... dead... hands.
Here you go!
The last of our ships is returned.
Is there any news on the chest?
None. But one of the ships did pick up a man adrift at sea.
He had these.
I took the liberty of filling in my name.
If you intend to claim these, then you must have something to trade. Do you have the Compass?
Better.
The heart of Davey Jones.
And what's *your* story?
My story? It's exactly the same as your story, just one chapter behind. I chased a man across the seven seas. The pursuit cost me my crew... my commission... and my life.
... Commodore?
No, not anymore, weren't you *listening*?
My compass is unique.
*Unique* here having the meaning of *broken*?
True enough.
Can't let you do that, William. 'Cause if Jones is dead, who's to call his terrible beastie off the hunt, eh? Now, if you please. The key.
I keep the promises I make, Jack. I intend to free my father. I hope you're here to see it.
I can't let you do that, either. So sorry.
I knew you'd warm up to me eventually.
Lord Beckett desires the contents of that chest. I deliver it, I get my life back.
Ah. The dark side of ambition.
Oh, I prefer to see it as the promise of redemption.
There was a time when I would have given anything for you to look like that while thinking about me.
I don't know what you mean.
I think you do.
Oh, don't be absurd, I trust him, that's all.
...Commodore?
No, not anymore, weren't you listening?"
Col. Robert Gould Shaw,AY,Officer And A Gentleman,"I ain't fightin' this war for you, sir.
I see.
I mean, what's the point? Ain't nobody gonna win. It's just gonna go on and on.
Can't go on forever.
Yeah, but ain't nobody gonna win, sir.
Somebody's gonna win.
Who? I mean, you get to go on back to Boston, big house and all that. What about us? What do we get?
Well, you won't get anything if we lose.
If you men will take no pay, then none of us will.
They've done it.
Assemble the men.
In accordance with President Lincoln's wishes, you men are advised that the Confederate Congress has issued a proclamation. It reads: 'Any negro taken in arms against the Confederacy will immediately be returned to a state of slavery. Any negro taken in Federal uniform will be summarily put to death. Any white officer taken in command of negro troops shall be deemed as inciting servile insurrection and shall likewise be put to death.' Full discharges will be granted in the morning to all those who apply. Dismissed.
If you're not here in the morning, I'll understand.
Still want that blue suit, nigger?
So what do you want to do?
Don't know, sir.
It stinks, I suppose.
Yeah, It stinks bad. And we all covered up in it too. Ain't nobody clean. Be nice to get clean, though.
How do we do that?
We ante up and kick in, sir. But I still don't want to carry your flag.
Why do you treat the men this way, Robert?
How should I treat them?
...Like men?
If this man should fall, who will lift the flag and carry on?
I will.
I'll see you in the fort, Thomas.
Oh, what do we have here? Bonnie Prince Charley and his toy bayonet! You're not reading your books now. Stab me.
What?
Stab-me.
I said STAB, not TICKLE! Come on, you prissy little schoolgirl! You're the worst soldier in this whole company, now HIT ME!
No shame, son, get up... I SAID GET UP!
Nigger forgot to duck, that's all!
Sergeant, deal with that man!
I ain't sure I'm wantin' this, Colonel.
I know exactly how you feel.
Never, question my authority in front of others
Well I is sorry, mas'sa. You be the boss-man now and all us chill'ins must learn your ways.
Mr. Rawlins... this morning, I... it would be a great help to me if I could talk to you from time to time about the men. That's all.
Shoes, sir.

The men need shoes, Colonel.
Yes, I've been after the quartermaster for some time.
No, sir. Now. That boy ran off to find him some shoes, Colonel. He wants to fight. Same as the rest of us. More, even.
We fight for men and women whose poetry is not yet written but which will presently be as enviable and as renowned as any.
There's more to fighting than rest, sir. There's character, there's strength of heart. You should have seen us in action two days ago. We were a sight to see! We'll be ready, sir. When do you want us?
Robert Gould Shaw, the son of wealthy Boston abolitionists, was 23 years old when he enlisted to fight in the War Between the States. He wrote home regularly, telling his parents of life in the gathering Army of the Potomac. / These letters are collected in the Houghton Library of Harvard University.
Dear Mother, I hope you are keeping well and not worrying much about me. You mustn't think that any of us are going to be killed. They are collecting such a force here, that an attack would be insane. The Massachusetts men passed though here this morning; how grand it is to meet the men from all the States, east and west, ready to fight for their country, as the old fellows did in the Revolution. But this time we must make it a whole country for all who live here, so that all can speak.
Sgt. Mulcahy!
Sir!
I have no doubt you a fair man, Mulcahy. I wonder if you are treating the men a little hard.
You may speak freely.
The boy is a friend of yours, is he?
Yes, we grew up together
Let him grow up some more.
The town is clean sir. Ain't no rebs here, just some women.
You hear that! Let's clear er out!
What are you doing?
Liberating this town in the name of the Republic.
Morning, Colonel. Change your mind about that bottle?
I want 600 pairs of shoes and 1200 pairs of socks... and anything else you've been holding out on us, you piece of rat filth!
I don't have any.
Not for niggers you don't!
Not for anybody.
I see. I'll just look around to see if you haven't misplaced them!
HEY!
You son of a bitch!
Goddamn it, you can't...!
Can't I? I'm a colonel, you nasty little cuss! You think you can keep 700 Union soldiers without proper shoes because you think it's *funny*? Now, where would that power come from?
Good morning gentlemen, I am Colonel Robert Gould Shaw. I am your commanding officer. It is a great pleasure to see you all here today. It is my hope that the same courage, spirit, and honor, which has brought us together, will one day restore this Union. May God bless us all.
Prepare your men to light torches!
I will not!
That is an order!
An immoral order, and by the Articles of War, I am not bound to follow it!
Then, you can explain that at your court-martial... after your men are placed under my command!
Glory hallelujah.
Got some letters here, personal things. Also, if I should fall, remember what you see here.
Dear Mother, They learn, learn quickly, faster than white troops it seems to me. They are almost grave and sedate under instruction and they restrain themselves. But the moment they are dismissed from drill every tongue is relaxed and every ivory tooth is visible and you would not know from the sound of it that this is an army camp. They must have learned this from long hours of meaningless, inhuman work oo set them free so quickly. It gives them great energy. And there is no doubt we will leave this state as fine a regiment as any that as marched. As ever, your son, Robert.
Before this war began, many of my regiment had never seen a Negro. Now the roads are choked with the dispossessed. We fight for men and women whose poetry is not yet written but which will presently be as enviable and as renowned as any."

Well then if you are going to *push* me...
...I would choose the right hand weevil; it has... significant advantage in both length and breadth.
There, I have you! You're completely dished! Do you not know that in the service...
...one must always choose the lesser of two weevils.
Do you want to see a guillotine in Piccadilly?
No!
Want to call that raggedy-ass Napoleon your king?
No!
You want your children to sing the ""La Marseillaise?""
NO!
Jack, I fear you have burdened me with a debt I can never fully repay.
Tosh! Name a shrub after me. Something prickly and hard to eradicate.
A shrub? Nonsense! I shall name a great tortoise after you: Testudo Aubreii!
They're exhausted. These men are exhausted. You've pushed them too hard.
Stephen, I invite you to this cabin as my friend. Not to criticise nor to comment on my command.
Well, shall I leave you until you're in a more harmonious frame of mind.
What would you have me do, Stephen?
Tip the ship's grog over the side.
Stop their grog?
Nagle was drunk when he insulted Hollom. Did you know that?
Stop 30 years of privilege and tradition. I'd rather have them three sheets to the wind than face a mutiny.
You see I'm rather understanding of mutinies. Men pressed from their homes, confined for months aboard a wooden prison...
I respect your right to disagree with me, but I can only afford one rebel on this ship. I hate it when you talk of the service in this way. It makes me feel so very low. You think I want to flog Nagle? A man who hacked the ropes that sent his mate to his death? Under MY orders? Do you not see? The only things that keep this wooden world together are hard work...
Jack, the man failed to salute. There's hierarchies even in nature. There is no disdain in nature. There is no...
Men must be governed! Often not wisely, but governed nonetheless.
That's the excuse of every tyrant in history, from Nero to Bonaparte. I, for one, am opposed to authority. It is an egg of misery and opression.
You've come to the wrong shop for anarchy, brother.
By comparison, the Surprise is a somewhat aged man-o-war. Am I not correct?
Would you call me an aged man-o-war, doctor? The Surprise is not old; no one would call her old. She has a bluff bow, lovely lines. She's a fine seabird: weatherly, stiff and fast... very fast, if she's well handled. No, she's not old; she's in her prime.
Jack, have you forgotten your promise?
Subject to the requirements of the service. I cannot in all conscience delay for the sake of an iguana or giant peccary. Fascinating, no doubt, but of no immediate application.
There is, I think, an opportunity here to serve both our purposes. As I understand it, this is a long, thin island. You need to sail around it to continue your voyage. I could walk across it. I'd be on the other side...
I have known you to spend hours staring into a deserted bird's nest.
I could walk briskly, pausing only to take the most important measurements. Making valuable discoveries that could help advance our knowledge of natural history.
If wind and tide had been against us, I should have said yes. They're not. I'm obliged to say no.
Oh, I see. I see. So, after all this time in your service, I must simply content myself to form part of this belligerent expedition. Hurry past inestimable wonders, bent solely on destruction. I shall say nothing of the corruption of power or its abuse...
You forget yourself, Doctor.
No, Jack. No. You've forgotten yourself. You see, for my part, I look upon a promise as binding.
The promise was conditional.
It never occurred to me...
I command a king's ship, not a private yacht! WE DO NOT HAVE TIME FOR YOUR DAMNED HOBBIES, SIR!
The simple truth is, not all of us become the men we once hoped we might be. But we are all God's creatures. If there are those among us who thought ill of Mr. Hollom, or spoke ill of him, or failed him in respect of fellowship... then we ask for your forgiveness, Lord. And we ask for his.
God be praised.
Tell me this wasn't on my account.
No, not at all. I just needed to stretch my legs.
Right lads, now, I know there's not a faint heart among you, and I know you're as anxious as I am to get into close action. But we must bring them right up beside us before we spring this trap. That will test our nerve, and discipline will count just as much as courage. The Acheron is a tough nut to crack... more than twice our guns, more than twice our numbers, and they will sell their lives dearly. Topmen, your handling of the sheets to be lubberly and un-navy like. Until the signal calls, you're to spill the wind from our sails, this will bring us almost to a complete stop. Gun crews, you must run out and tie down in double quick time. With the rear wheels removed, you've gained elevation. and without recoil, there'll be no chance for re-load, so gun captains, that gives you one shot from the lardboard battery... one shot only. You'll fire for her mainmast. Much will depend on your accuracy... however... even crippled, she will still be dangerous, like a wounded beast. Captain Howard and the marines will sweep their weather deck with swivel gun and musket fire from the tops. They'll try and even the odds for us before we board. They mean to take us as a prize.
And we are worth more to them undamaged. Their greed... will be their downfall. England is under threat of invasion, and though we be on the far side of the world, this ship is our home. This ship, is England. So it's every hand to his rope or gun, quick's the word and sharp's the action. After all... surprise is on our side.
Huzzah, huzzah!
This is the second time he's done this to me. There will not be a third.
Killick, an extra ration of rum for these men.
Thank you very much, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Which I was savin' for Salutin' Day, I was.
We'll drink wine.
Oh, drink wine for Salutin' Day...
My God, what can we do? He has us by the hip.
Run like smoke and oakum.
We'll have to bend every sail.
We'll put up our handkerchiefs if we have to. We must survive this day.
For England, for home, and for the prize!
Excuse me, sir, but what are they building?
Your first command.
What is it with this man? Did I kill a relative of his in battle, perhaps? His boy, God forbid?
He fights like you, Jack.
I'm sorry, Jack. I'm doing everything I can. I know you were close to his father.
His father would've understood. He knew the life. His mother, however...
Let me take a look at that brow of yours.
What?
Damn, he was good. Just came out of nowhere. Hit us with a full broadside, cut across our tail and took out our rudder. Damn fine gunnery. We only slipped away because of the fog. Quite fortunate, really. He may have had the weather gauge, but we had the weather gods.
I have no idea what precisely it is you're talking about, but he did seem to come off rather well.
Seven weeks sailing, and he happens in darkness on our exact position.
Hm. Well, the French have their spies in England and elsewhere. As do we.
Indeed. If he knew we were looking for him, he could have stood to sea and passed well clear.
Well then, perhaps he was looking for us.
Oh a week, perhaps.
A week?
There's no great hurry.
Mustn't we make haste for...
I'm not even sure it was the Acheron we sighted. And if it was, she'll be well away by now. Like looking for an honest man in parliament.
Tell me that wasn't fun!
Master at arms, take that man below and clap him in irons.
I'll rest easier when I know they've reached shore. So many wounded. And only that poor, unfortunate Higgins to tend to them. Still, he's better than no doctor at all.
I met their doctor. I spoke to him.
No, he died of fever months ago.
Le Vigny?
Yes.
Ah.
Pass the word for Mr. Mowett.
Aye, sir. Mr. Mowett to the great cabin.
Their doctor gave me this sword.
Sir?
Mr. Mowett, change of course. Southeast by east. We'll intercept the Acheron and we'll escort them into Valparaiso.
Aye, sir. Sou'east by east.
And William?
Sir?
Beat to quarters.
Very good, sir.
""Subject to the requirements of the service.""
Ah... Well, Stephen, the bird's flightless?
Yes.
It's not going anywhere.
...Clearly, something nautical and fascinating just happened; I am at a loss.
We have made our turn northward; we are headed back toward the sun!
Le Capitaine?
L'infirmerie.
England is under threat of invasion, and though we be on the far side of the world, this ship is our home. This ship *is* England.
Sir?
Excuse me, sir, but Mr. Blankeney said that you served under Lord Nelson at the Nile.
Indeed. I was a young lieutenant, not much older than you are now. And Mr.Pullings... Mr.Pullings was a snivelling midshipman,
still yearning for hearth and home.
Did you meet him, sir? Can you tell me what he was like?
I have had the honour of dining with him twice. He spoke to me on both occasions. A master tactician and a man of singular vision.
Right. He always said in battle... ""Never mind the manoeuvres, just go straight at 'em.""
Some would say not a great seamen, but a great leader.
He's England's only hope if old Boney intends to invade.
Sir, might we press you for an anecdote?
The first time he spoke to me... I shall never forget his words. I remember it like it was yesterday. He leaned across the table, he looked me straight in the eye, and he said ""Aubrey... may I trouble you for the salt?""
I've always tried to say it exactly as he did ever since.
The second time... The second time he told me a story... about how someone offered him a boat cloak on a cold night. And he said no, he didn't need it. That he was quite warm. His zeal for his king and country kept him warm.
I know it sounds absurb, and were it from another man, you'd cry out ""Oh, what pitiful stuff"" and dismiss it as mere enthusiasm. But with Nelson... you felt your heart glow.
Wouldn't you say, Mr.Pullings?
You did indeed, sir.
Run like smoke and oakum!
Now to lure this predator in and spring our trap.
Jack... *you're* the predator.
I never realized that the study of nature could advance the science of naval warfare.
I'm sorry you had to leave the majority of your collection behind, Stephen.
In actual fact, Mr. Blakeney and I did make one very interesting find.
Is that right?
Let me guess: a stick?
Tell him about it, Mr. Blakeney.
It's a rare phasmid, sir.
A phasmid?
It's an insect that disguises itself as a stick, to confuse its predators.
This is a ship of war, and I will grind whatever grist the mill requires in order to fulfill my duty.
Whatever the cost?
Whatever the cost.
To wives and sweethearts.
To wives and sweethearts.
May they never meet.
Do you see those two weevils doctor?
I do.
Which would you choose?
Neither; there is not a scrap a difference between them. They are the same species of Curculio.
If you had to choose. If you were forced to make a choice. If there was no other response...
Well then if you are going to *push* me...
...I would choose the right hand weevil; it has... significant advantage in both length and breadth.
There, I have you! You're completely dished! Do you not know that in the service...

Captain Nicholls,AY,Officer And A Gentleman,"What are you up to?
I'm writing a letter.
With a picture in it?
It's to the boy who owned Joey. I want to show him how wonderful he's looking.
Before we take him across the channel to face a million German guns.
Yes, before that.
I promise you, that I'll look after him as closely as you've done, I'll respect him and all the care that you've taken with him. And if I can, I'll return him to your care."
William Munny,BE,Retired Outlaw,"You'd be William Munny out of Missouri. Killer of women and children.
That's right. I've killed women and children. I've killed just about everything that walks or crawled at one time or another. And I'm here to kill you, Little Bill, for what you did to Ned.
I don't deserve this... to die like this. I was building a house.
Deserve's got nothin' to do with it.
I'll see you in hell, William Munny.
Yeah.
All right, I'm coming out. Any man I see out there, I'm gonna shoot him. Any sumbitch takes a shot at me, I'm not only gonna kill him, but I'm gonna kill his wife, all his friends, and burn his damn house down.
Who's the fellow owns this shithole?
You, fat man. Speak up.
Uh, I... I own this establishment. I bought the place from Greeley for a thousand dollars.
You better clear outta there.
Yes, sir.
Just hold it right there. Hold it...!
Well, sir, you are a cowardly son of a bitch! You just shot an unarmed man!
Well, he should have armed himself if he's going to decorate his saloon with my friend.
It don't seem real... how he ain't gonna never breathe again, ever... how he's dead. And the other one too. All on account of pulling a trigger.
It's a hell of a thing, killing a man. Take away all he's got and all he's ever gonna have.
Yeah, well, I guess they had it coming.
We all got it coming, kid.
Are you still goin' to kill those men?
I reckon so. The money's still available, ain't it?
Yeah. Your two friends have been taking advances on the money.
What?
You know, free ones.
Alice and Silky been givin' them free ones. Would you like a free one?
I reckon not.
I didn't mean with me. Alice and Silky would be glad to give you one.
I meant I didn't want a free one with Alice or Silky. Because of my wife back home. I reckon if I was to want a free one, it would be with you.
You better bury Ned right!... Better not cut up, nor otherwise harm no whores... or I'll come back and kill every one of you sons of bitches.
I sure do miss my bed.
You said that last night.
No, last night I said I missed my wife, tonight I just miss my dadgum bed.
Any man don't wanna get killed better clear on out the back.
Hell, Will. We ain't bad men no more. Shit, we're farmers.
Should be easy killing them, supposing they don't go on down to Texas first.
How long has it been since you fired a gun at a man, Will? Nine, ten years?
Eleven.
Easy, huh? Hell, I don't know that it was all that easy even back then. And we was young and full of beans. I mean, if you was mad at 'em, Will, I mean. If they'd done you some wrong, I could see shooting 'em.
We done stuff for money before, Ned.
Yeah, we thought we did. All right, so what did these fellas do? Cheat at cards? Steal some strays? Spit on a rich fella? What?
No, they cut up a woman.
What?
Yeah, they cut up her face, cut her eyes out, cut her fingers off, cut her tits, everything but her cunty, I suppose.
I'll be dogg - Golly, I guess they got it comin'. 'Course, you know, Will, if Claudia was alive you wouldn't be doin' this.
I ain't like that no more. I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she straightened me up, cleared me of drinkin' whiskey and all. Just 'cause we're goin' on this killing, that don't mean I'm gonna go back to bein' the way I was. I just need the money, get a new start for them youngsters. Ned, you remember that drover I shot through the mouth and his teeth came out the back of his head? I think about him now and again. He didn't do anything to deserve to get shot, at least nothin' I could remember when I sobered up.
You were crazy, Will.
Yeah, no one liked me. Mountain boys all thought I was gonna shoot 'em out of pure meanness.
Well, like I said, you ain't like that no more.
That's right. I'm just a fella now. I ain't no different than anyone else no more.
I don't deserve this... to die like this. I was building a house.
Deserve's got nothin' to do with it.
I'll see you in hell William Munny.
...Yeah...

Like I was saying, you don't look no meaner-than-hell, cold-blooded, damn killer.
Maybe I ain't.
Yeah, well, Uncle Pete says you was the meanest goddamn son-of-a-bitch alive, and if I ever wanted a partner for a killin', you were the worst one. Meaning the best, on account as your's as cold as the snow and you don't have no weak nerve nor fear.
Pete said that, huh?
Yeah, yeah he did. I'm a damn killer myself. 'Cept, uh, I ain't killed as many as you because of my youth.
He said how you was really William Munny out of Missouri... and Bill said ""Same William Munny that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?"" And Ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you was more cold blooded than William Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James Brothers and how if he hurt Ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a U.S. Marshall in '73.
And that didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
No, sir.
You go on, keep it. I'm never gonna use it again. I won't kill nobody no more. I ain't like you, Will...
Go on, keep it. All of it. It's yours.
What about your spectacles and fancy clothes?
I guess I'd rather be blind and ragged than dead.
You don't have to worry, Kid. I ain't gonna kill you. You're the only friend I got.
I seen 'em, Ned, I seen the angel of death, he's got snake eyes.
Who Will, who's got snake eyes?
It's the angel of death. Oh Ned, I'm scared of dying.
Easy, partner, easy.
I see Claudia too.
That's good, Will, that's good you saw Claudia, ain't it?
Her face was all covered with worms. Oh Ned, I'm scared, I'm dying. Don't tell nobody, don't tell my kids, none of the things I done, hear me?
All right, Will.
What I said the other day, you looking like me, that ain't true. You ain't ugly like me, it's just that we both have got scars.
It's a hell of a thing, ain't it, killin' a man. You take everything he's got... and everything he's ever gonna have...
Well, I guess they had it... comin'.
We all got it comin', Kid.
You boys better move away.
All right, gentlemen. He's got one barrel left. When he fires that, take out your pistols, and shoot him down like the mangy scoundrel he is!
Wanna help me count this, kid?
I trust you.
Don't go trusting me too much.
I'm dyin' boys. Jesus, I'm so thirsty.
Give him a drink of water, goddamn it. Will you give him a drink of water, for Christ's sake? We ain't gonna shoot.
Who, uh, who'd you kill first?
Huh?
When confronted by superior numbers, an experienced gunfighter will always fire on the best shot first.
Is that so?
Yeah, Little Bill told me that. And you probably killed him first, didn't you?
I was lucky in the order, but I've always been lucky when it comes to killin' folks.
And so, who was next? It was Clyde, right? You must have killed Clyde. Well, it could have been Deputy Andy. Wasn't it? Or, or...
All I can tell you is who's gonna be last.
That was the first one.
First one what?
First one I ever killed.
Yeah?
You know how I said I shot five men? It weren't true. That Mexican that come at me with a knife, I just busted his leg with a shovel. I didn't kill him or nothing, neither.
Well, you sure killed the hell outta that fella today.
You still think he's in there? the outhouse
Yeah, he's in there.
Well he's holding onto his shit like it was money.
Hey, Kid!
KID? Is that Kid shooting at us?
Funny thing, killin' a man. You take away everything he's got and everything he's gonna have.
Here, take this money and give my half and Ned's half to my kids. Tell 'em if I ain't back in a week, they give half to Sally Two-Trees. You keep the rest, you can get them spectacles now."
Ned Logan,BE,Retired Outlaw,"I sure do miss my bed.
You said that last night.
No, last night I said I missed my wife, tonight I just miss my dadgum bed.
Hell, Will. We ain't bad men no more. Shit, we're farmers.
Should be easy killing them, supposing they don't go on down to Texas first.
How long has it been since you fired a gun at a man, Will? Nine, ten years?
Eleven.
Easy, huh? Hell, I don't know that it was all that easy even back then. And we was young and full of beans. I mean, if you was mad at 'em, Will, I mean. If they'd done you some wrong, I could see shooting 'em.
We done stuff for money before, Ned.
Yeah, we thought we did. All right, so what did these fellas do? Cheat at cards? Steal some strays? Spit on a rich fella? What?
No, they cut up a woman.
What?
Yeah, they cut up her face, cut her eyes out, cut her fingers off, cut her tits, everything but her cunty, I suppose.
I'll be dogg - Golly, I guess they got it comin'. 'Course, you know, Will, if Claudia was alive you wouldn't be doin' this.
I ain't like that no more. I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she straightened me up, cleared me of drinkin' whiskey and all. Just 'cause we're goin' on this killing, that don't mean I'm gonna go back to bein' the way I was. I just need the money, get a new start for them youngsters. Ned, you remember that drover I shot through the mouth and his teeth came out the back of his head? I think about him now and again. He didn't do anything to deserve to get shot, at least nothin' I could remember when I sobered up.
You were crazy, Will.
Yeah, no one liked me. Mountain boys all thought I was gonna shoot 'em out of pure meanness.
Well, like I said, you ain't like that no more.
That's right. I'm just a fella now. I ain't no different than anyone else no more.
I seen 'em, Ned, I seen the angel of death, he's got snake eyes.
Who Will, who's got snake eyes?
It's the angel of death. Oh Ned, I'm scared of dying.
Easy, partner, easy.
I see Claudia too.
That's good, Will, that's good you saw Claudia, ain't it?
Her face was all covered with worms. Oh Ned, I'm scared, I'm dying. Don't tell nobody, don't tell my kids, none of the things I done, hear me?
All right, Will.
Hey, Kid!
KID? Is that Kid shooting at us?"
Butch Cassidy,BE,Retired Outlaw,"Alright. I'll jump first.
No.
Then you jump first.
No, I said.
What's the matter with you?
I can't swim.
Are you crazy? The fall will probably kill you.
Oh, shit...
Boy, I got vision, and the rest of the world wears bifocals.
Kid, there's something I ought to tell you. I never shot anybody before.
One hell of a time to tell me!
Well, that ought to do it.
Think ya used enough dynamite there, Butch?
Kid, the next time I say, ""Let's go someplace like Bolivia,"" let's GO someplace like Bolivia.
It's your great ideas that got us into this mess. I never want to hear another one of your great ideas. Ever!
Australia. I thought that secretly you wanted to know so I told you.
That's your great idea?
The latest in a long line. We get out of here alive, we go to Australia. Goodbye, Bolivia. Hello to Australia.
Australia is no better than here.
That's all you know.
Name me one thing.
They speak English in Australia.
They do?
That's right, smart guy, so we wouldn't be foreigners. We'd blend in more easily. They got horses in Australia and thousands of miles of countryside that we can hide out in, and good climate. Nice beaches. You can learn to swim.
No. Swimming isn't important. What about the banks?
Very easy. Easy, ripe, and luscious.
The banks or the women?
Well, once you get one you get the other.
But... Australia is quite a long way from here.
Oh, please! Everything with you has got to be perfect!
I just don't want to get there and realize that it stinks, that's all.
At least think about it.
All right... I'll think about it.
Guns or knives?
Neither?
Pick!
I don't want to shoot with you, Harvey.
Anything you say, Butch.
Maybe there's a way to make a profit in this. Bet on Logan.
I would, but who'd bet on you?
Sundance, when we're done and he's dead, you're welcome to stay.
Listen, I don't mean to be a sore loser, but when it's done, if I'm dead, kill him.
Love to.
No, no, not yet. Not until me and Harvey get the rules straightened out.
Rules? In a knife fight? No rules!
Well, if there aint' going to be any rules, let's get the fight started. Someone count. 1,2,3 go.
1,2,3, go!
I was really rooting for you, Butch.
Well, thank you, Flatnose. That's what sustained me in my time of trouble.
What happened to the old bank? It was beautiful.
People kept robbing it.
Small price to pay for beauty.
Hey, what are you doin'?
Stealin' your woman?
Take her.
Take her.
Well, you're a romantic bastard, I'll give you that.
Is that what you call giving cover?
Is that what you call running? If I knew you were going to stroll...
Who are those guys?
Ready? OK, when we get outside and we get to the horses, whatever happens, just remember one thing... hey, wait a minute.
What?
You didn't see Lefors out there, did you?
Lefors? No.
Oh, good. For a moment there I thought we were in trouble.
¡Fuego!
¡Fuego!
¡Fuego!
Well, I think I'll get saddled up and go looking for a woman.
Good hunting.
Shouldn't take more than a couple of days. I'm not picky. As long as she's smart, pretty, and sweet, and gentle, and tender, and refined, and lovely, and carefree...
How many are following us?
All of 'em.
All of 'em? What's the matter with those guys?
You know, it could be worse. You get a lot more for your money in Bolivia, I checked on it.
What could they have here that you could possibly want to buy?
The future's all yours, you lousy bicycles.
You remember the time you and me and Etta went to Denver one summer for a vacation?
I'm glad you brought that up, Kid. That's an important topic, considering our situation.
The night we went gambling, you remember?
We had dinner at the hotel. Etta had roast beef and I had chicken, and if I can remember what you had, I'll die a happy man.
Do you know what you're doing?
Theoretically.
Manos a... Manos, um...
Manos arriba!
They got 'em up! Skip on down.
Arriba!
Skip on down!
Todos ustedes ""arrismense"" a la pared.
They're against the wall already!
Donde... Ah, you're so damn smart, You read it!
I couldn't do that. Could you do that? Why can they do it? Who are those guys?
They'll never follow us.
How do you know?
Would you jump if you didn't have to?
I have to and I'm not gonna.
Butch?
Hmm.
Do you ever wonder if I'd met you first, we'd be the ones to get involved?
But we are involved, Etta. Don't you know that? I mean you are riding on my bicycle - in some Arabian countries that's the same as being married.
What do you think? I'll bet it's just one guy.
Don't you get sick of being right all the time?
You know, when I was a kid, I always thought I'd grow up to be a hero.
Well, it's too late now.
What'd you say that for? You didn't have to say something like that.
We're going to run out unless we can get to that mule and get some more.
I'll go.
This is no time for bravery. I'll let ya!
Jeesh, all Bolivia can't look like this.
How do you know? This might be the garden spot of the whole country. People may travel hundreds of miles just to get to this spot where we're standing now. This might be the Atlantic City, New Jersey of all Bolivia for all you know.
Look, I know a lot more about Bolivia than you know about Atlantic City, New Jersey, I can tell you that!
Aha! You do, huh? I was born there, I was born in New Jersey. Was brought up there, so...
You're from the east? I didn't know that.
The total tonnage of what you don't know is enough to shatter...
I'm not sure we're accomplishing as much as we'd like here.
Listen, your job is to back me up, because you'd starve without me. And you, your job is to shut up!
He'll feel a lot better after he's robbed a couple of banks.
Bolivia. Hahahaha...
If he'd just pay me what he's spending to make me stop robbing him, I'd stop robbing him. You probably inherited every penny you got!
Well, the way I figure it, we can either fight or give. If we give, we go to jail.
I've been there already.
We could fight - they'll stay right where they are and starve us out. Or go for position, shoot us. Might even get a rock slide started, get us that way. What else can they do?
They could surrender to us, but I wouldn't count on that.
Do you believe I'm broke already?
Why is there never any money, Butch?
Well, I swear, Etta, I don't know. I've been working like a dog all my life and I can't get a penny ahead.
Sundance says it's because you're a soft touch, and always taking expensive vacations, and buying drinks for everyone, and you're a rotten gambler.
Well that might have something to do with it.
What I'm saying is, if you want to go, I won't stop you. But the minute you start to whine or make a nuisance, I don't care where we are, I'm dumping you flat.
Don't sugarcoat it like that, Kid. Tell her straight.
I'm 26, and I'm single, and a school teacher, and that's the bottom of the pit. And the only excitement I've known is here with me now. I'll go with you, and I won't whine, and I'll sew your socks, and I'll stitch you when you're wounded, and I'll do anything you ask of me except one thing. I won't watch you die. I'll miss that scene if you don't mind.
Don't ever hit your mother with a shovel. It will leave a dull impression on her mind.
I swear, if Sweetface told me that I rode out of town ten minutes ago, I'd believe him.
Which way?
It doesn't matter. I don't know where we've been and I've just been there.
Look out there!
What?
Remember a few years ago when we were at a saloon in Denver? We got to talking to some gambler that night, and he told us about an Indian. A full-blooded Indian, except he called himself by an English name. Sir... somebody.
Lord Baltimore?
Lord Baltimore, that's right, and he could track anybody, over anything, day or night.
So?
The guy on the ground. I think it's him.
No, Baltimore works out of Oklahoma. He's strictly an Oklahoma man. I don't know where we are, but it sure as Hell isn't Oklahoma. No, it couldn't be him. Couldn't be him.
I guess.
Ah, you're wasting your time. They can't track us over rocks.
Tell them that.
They're beginning to get on my nerves. Who are those guys?
Oh don't you remember sweet Betsy from Pike / Crossed the high mountains with her lover Ike / Two yoke of oxen and big yellow dog / Called Shanghai rooster and one spotted hog / Hoodle-dang-hootie-i-doh, hoodle-dang-hootie-ay, hoodle-dang-hootie-i-doh, hoodle-dang-hootie-ay / Shanghai ran off and the cattle all died / last piece of bacon that morning was fried...
I think they're in the trees up ahead.
In the bushes on the left.
I'm telling you they're in the trees up ahead.
You take the trees, I'll take the bushes.
Will you two beginners cut it out.
Well, we're just trying to spot an ambush, Mr. Garris.
Morons. I've got morons on my team. Nobody is going to rob us going down the mountain. We have got no money going down the mountain. When we have got the money, on the way back, then you can sweat.
How long before you figure they're not after us?
A while longer.
How come you're so talkative?
Naturally blabby, I guess.
Once they divide up, we take them, no trouble, right?
Maybe.
Boy, for a gunman, you're one hell of a pessimist.
Don't they get tired? Don't they get hungry?
They gotta be.
Why don't they slow up? Hell, they could even go faster, at least that'd be a change. They don't even break formation. Do something.
What if they don't follow the horse?
You're the brains, Butch. Don't worry, you'll think of something.
Who's the best lawman?
The best, how? You mean toughest? Or easiest to bribe?
Toughest.
Joe Lefors.
Got to be.
Lefors never leaves Wyoming, never. You know that.
He always wears a white skimmer. That's how you tell it's Joe Lefors, 'cause he always wears a white straw hat. Look at that guy out front.
Who are those guys?
You can't want to get blown up again.
Butch, you know that if it were my money, there is nobody that I would rather have steal it than you. But, you see, I am still in the employment of E. H. Harriman of the Union Pacific Railroad!
Hey, Butch?
What?
They're very good.
Move in slowly, check out everything. The thing to remember...
Don't tell me how to rob a bank. I know how to rob a bank.
My, we seem to be a little short on brotherly love round here.
If you're with him you better get yourselves out of here.
Boy, you know every time I see Hole-in-the-Wall again, it's like seeing it fresh for the first time. And every time that happens, I keep asking myself the same question: how could I be so damn stupid to keep coming back here?
What's your idea this time?
El guisado esta delicioso. Para chuparse los dedos. Si quieren mas, es la especialidad de la casa si quieren mas, no tengan pena y diganmelo. Yo estoy aqui para servirles. Agraddezo la visita de tan distinguidos calballeros. Muchas gracias. Para servas.
The Specialty of the House and it's still movin'!
Well we're back in business boys and girls, just like the old days.
I can't help you, Sundance.
Butch and me have been talking it all over. Wherever the hell Bolivia is, that's where we're off to.
Yeah, we'll go down there and play it safe.
You are mine, Etta Place. Mine. You hear me? Mine! All mine! Your soft white flesh is mine. Soft... white... Bleargh.
Oh, forget it. Bunch like that won't stay together long.
Yes they will, if Mr. Harriman has his way.
Who?
Mr. E. H. Harriman of the Union Pacific Railroad. He resents the way you've been picking on him. So he's outfitted a special train and hired special employees. You spent the last couple of days avoiding them. It's really sort of flattering, if you want to think about it that way.
A setup like that cost more than we ever took. That crazy Harriman. That's bad business! How long do you think I'd stay in operation if every time I pulled a job it cost me money? If he'd just pay me what he's spending to make me stop robbing him, I'd stop robbing him!
You probably inherited every penny you got!
You're choking me! You're choking me!
I don't enjoy jungles and I don't enjoy swamps. I don't like snakes. I don't much care for night work.
Bitch, bitch, bitch.
I don't enjoy jungles and I don't enjoy swamps. I don't like snakes. I don't much care for night work.
Bitch, Bitch, Bitch."
The Sundance Kid,BE,Retired Outlaw,"Alright. I'll jump first.
No.

Don't you get sick of being right all the time?
I didn't know you were the Sundance Kid when I said you were cheating. If I draw on you, you'll kill me.
There's that possibility.

Oh, I'm not afraid of you, I'm not afraid of anything! I'm a grandmother and a female and I've got my rights. You can bull all the others, but you can't bull me! I've fought whiskey and I've fought gambling and I can certainly fight you!

You probably inherited every penny you got!

Patrick Floyd 'Pat' Garrett,BE,Retired Outlaw,"Jesus Christ! Even their horses are crazy!
It's alright, we've got time. We'll go back through El Royal.
Well, that's convenient.
What?
The Kid'll be long gone. Maybe that's what you want, Pat.
What I want is for you to cork your goddamn government mouth, mister. And the next time you address me common, I will put you on your prissy little ass.
Sheriff I need to have a movement!
Me too!
...you used to make me hotter than a June bride sitting bareback on a depot stove but I don't share my bed with the law.
And I don't keep with whores no more so ain't we both content.
You killed the boys, Patsie!
No, Kid. You did. If I was with you I'd be one of 'em.
Wait, do I know you?
Yeah, you know me, you do.
Yeah.
Yeah...
What's your name?
Travers, from Tula Rosa.
Travers... hmm, nope."

Mighty impressive hardware you packin' there...
Why don't you get your eyes of my package, you twisted son of a bitch!
If people start looking at you funny then just say, ""Howdy, partner.""
...Howdy... partner?
Say it a little faster than that or people'll think you're slow in the head.
C'mon Roy, you can do it! Ah, no you can't, he's gonna kill ya.
Alright, pay attention because I don't want any mistakes.
I've calculated the speed of the train and the speed of our horses. We meet at this vector; the only variable is the wind. Technically, if you travel...
Is this the train?
Alright, we're just gonna wing it.
I am invincible...
Reach for the sky ladies and gentle...
Touch that gun and I'll blow your goddamn head off!
What are you doing? No, no, I sorta like to be the only guy that talks, alright?
Okay, sorry.
Why's the new guy talking? Where did you get this guy? I'm the only one who talks!
We stick together. We are partners.
That's beautiful.
I *am* like a wild horse. You can't tame me. You put the oats in the pen, though, and I'll come in for a nibble every day. But the minute you shut that gate, I'll jump the fence and you'll never see me again.
See! I told you so!
No, you said ""wet shirt don't break,"" not ""piss shirt bend bar""!
I don't know karate, but I know kar-azy, and I will use it!
Dig.
Hey!
Don't talk. Just dig.
I got an idea: why don't I pretend I'm sick, and then you can attack the guard when they come in?
Oh, you mean the sick prisoner routine? Does that still work in China? 'Cause here it's sorta been done to death.
There, sort of a rakish angle.
How do I look?
I think you look great! I think you look like a real cowboy. Very dapper - red bandana.
Roy O'Bannon.
My name is Chon Wang.
John Wayne?
Chon Wang.
That's a terrible cowboy name!
Why?
No, come on. That's not gonna work. That's horrible; that's so bad! And so's the ponytail!
He took the gold.
Is that all you care about, the gold? Shame on you.
Here give me the dynamite.
No. No. You stay here! You don't get to do it.
What happened?
Oh nothing I just killed him, how'd you do?
You gave me bad directions!
No, I gave you wrong directions.
Want your toothpicks back?
Holy crap, the vultures are eating my head!
It's a miracle. I am invincible. Roy! Invincible!
I feel like there's this gap between us. It's like I'm a cowboy, you're an Indian. You say wampum, I say money. It is so important, I just think that...
Shut up, Roy. You talk too much.
Chon Wang!
That's right, Johnny Wayne's here.
Yes, John, I've heard all about the Emperor. Must be one hell of a man.
He's only twelve.
Are you kidding me? You're sitting here, waiting to die for someone whose balls haven't even dropped?
First time you ever see an outlaw?
Scared? Kind of excited, too? All mixed up? Yeah. Last train we robbed we were naked it was so hot out.
Just relax.
Is that relaxed? You look sort of rigid there.
You gotta be able to laugh at stuff like that. Like me in the desert. I don't hold any grudges; I laugh about it. I'm not angry at you. You just left me there with chopsticks to die. Roy, all by his lonesome, just me and the buzzards, pickin' at my head... You're a very silent man, aren't you?
There's more to life than money. I hope you learn that one day.
Is that her? She's pretty! Grab her!
Did I hit you?
No, but you're getting really close.
You've almost killed me like seventeen times already!
Eighteen, nineteen, twenty! You're on fire today!
How do you survive out here?
What's that supposed to mean?
So who are you?
I'm an Imperial Guard to the Emperor of China.
China... what's with the book?
The book belongs to Princess Pei Pei. She was kidnapped from the Forbidden City.
I like that, Forbidden City, a princess, kidnapped! It's so mysterious.
Let me out! Give me the book back! I have to go to Carson City to rescue the Princess! You've got the wrong person, I don't belong here!
Keep going with the Chinese, I think that's working. I think they're just about to let you out.
You killed my uncle!
Bull! That was Wallace! All the way!
He was one of your bandits.
He wasn't part of my gang! He was a new guy! And he's crazy as a road lizard!
Well, best of luck to you. Guess this is what your people call ""sayanora."" Looks like Fido's giving you some problems there. You want me to, uh, give you a hand?
No, I can do it.
*Sure* you can. H-How is a greenhorn like you gonna make it to Carson City and rescue this princess?
Stop, stop, stop, stop. I can't take it any more. Watch me do it.
You get it like this and you put it up high
. See, it'll drift back when you're riding.
All right, I'll do it.
Do what?
Take you to Carson City, help you rescue Princess Pee Pee.
Pei Pei! You do not care about the princess.
You don't know me very well, do you? Tell you one thing: I hate to think of an innocent member of Chinese nobility suffering, I'll tell you that.
You people believe in Karma over there, right? Well I've been thinking... there must be a reason why we keep running into each other. Now I've ridden with some terrible men, just people I couldn't trust, but when I look at you, there's something different about you. And I can see it, I can see it in your eyes. It's what the Indians call... chipichawa.
What's that?
Chipichawa is nobility. And you have it, in spades. You got yourself a partner, and this has nothing to do with gold, okay?
Shake on it.
Why are you spitting in your hand?
Well, it's, uh, customary to seal the deal. Come on, let's go
. No, you -
this is going to be a long journey.
Now I'm gonna have to get rid of my outlaw name, it just won't work anymore. My real name's Wyatt Earp.
Come on. We're men, we're not pinatas!
I was just winging it!
What? No! That's not how we wing it! You've lost your 'winging it' privileges!
Let me put it this way. My horse is definitely not my best friend.
You blew it, John! Never interrupt a man in the middle of a duel! I had 'im! That's what gets me: I had 'im! I had 'im!
I'm so lost, Chon. Ninety percent of the time I don't even know what I'm doing out here in the West.
No, you're a good outlaw.
Stop, please. I'm a screw-up.
You blew it. Whoo, you blew it, man. You did not want to cut his hair off, trust me.
What happened my horse? Is he dead?
No, but we are, Chon.
These guns are really weird.
Maybe we should let bygones be bygones. You got off some good shots, I got off some good ones. Let's call it a tie.
Reach for the sky, Baldy!
Reach for the sky, O'Bannon, ha ha!
That's my line. He stole my gang, he's stealing my lines. It's unbelievable!
The thing about your husband, and this is nothing against him, I mean I really like him, but...
he comes from a very male dominated society.
Come on out, Little Roy. Work your magic.
A 2000-year-old civilization and that's the best you can come up with? Shame on you. Shame on you!
This is serious. You don't come back from this.
That's the general idea.
Why don't you turn and face me like a man?
Why don't you do it your way and I'll do it my way?
Okay, I like your energy but I'm not with you...
When the shirt gets wet, it doesn't break.
...I don't know what that means.
Where did you get this guy?
Texas.
Texas?
Are you insane?"
Lennie Pike,AC,Dumb Muscle,"*Everybody* has to pay taxes!- Even businessmen, that rob and steal and cheat from people everyday, even *they* have to pay *taxes*!
Then what happens next? I'll tell you what happens: Then they all decide that I'm supposed to get a smaller share! That I'm somebody extra special stupid, or something! That they don't even care if it's a democracy! And in a democracy, it don't matter how stupid you are, you still get an equal share!
Mama, who's with you? Where are you talking to me... Where are you?
I'm with this truck driver at Peterson's garage in a place called Plaster City. And will you just shut up a minute so I can tell you what happened!
Now listen, Mommy, you listen to me close. You stay right there, because I'm coming, Mom. I'm coming to get you right now, Mom.
Will you SHUT UP AND LISTEN?
Mama, it's all right. Everything's gonna be all right, Mama. Your baby's coming to get ya. You just sit there. Sit there, relax, take it easy.
Sylvester...
I'm coming to get you, Mom!
... shut up and let me talk...
Everything is gonna be all right!
Well?
So he's coming here. And I'm not to worry about a thing, because ""everything is going to be all right!""
Exactly like your father: a big, stupid, muscle-headed moron!
That guy's dead. You better believe it.
Oh, I believe it all right, but if he jumps up again like he did before, I'm gonna get the hell out of here.
Look! We've figured it seventeen different ways, and every time we figured it, it was no good, because no matter how we figured it, somebody don't like the way we figured it! So now, there's only one way to figure it. And that is, every man, including the old bag, for himself!
So good luck, and may the best man win!
Right! Except you,lady. May you just drop dead!
All right, all right, we all agree on that. Now look, let's be sensible about this thing. There's money in this for all of us. Right? There's enough for you, there's enough for you, and for me, and for you, and there's enough for...
Here,
take this and go hire us the best car you can find.
But... this is a little girl's bike. This is for a little girl. Oh listen, I got to get this stuff back in so I can lock up the van.
We'll put everything away. Will you get going please, will you hurry?
Oh okay... I gotta admit. I feel kinda silly. You know what I mean?
That's him! That's him! I tell you, when I catch you, I'll kill you! I tell you, I'll kill you, you dirty *robber*!
Someone you know?
Wait a minute, wait a minute. There's not enough room, Man, you're bugging me. You're bugging me.
What are you talking about 'bugging'?
Cut out, cut out.
What's this 'cut out' talk?
Out, baby. Out, baby. Out!
Don't call me a baby!
Would you just get out? Get on with it!
And I give you my word. My wife wanted to stop for you, I wanted to stop for you, he wanted to stop for you. But tell him, tell him how my mother in-law made us drive right by him...
Listen, anything you got to say about your mother in-law, you don't have to explain to me. You know what I mean? Like if she were the star of a real crummy horror movie, I'd believe it.
So! So someone will ""stumble over the little girl's bicycle in the dark"", huh? Well when I'm finished with *you*, they'll be stumbling over *YOU* in the *dark*!
All right lady, are you gonna get out or am I gonna have to throw you out?
Oh please Mr. Pike, don't get upset.
He's not gonna do anything! Drive on, ya big stupid idiot!
Now fellas, you keep this up and I'm gonna get sore. I mean it.
It's buried under a big W. Say, what is a big W?
When we find out, we'll send you a 'Wire'.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
The man said there was a certain amount of money buried down in this park.
That's right. It was under a big W. Say what is a big W?
If we find out, we'll send you a wire.
It's only a possibility now, it's only a possibility that this man was telling the truth. And if it was the truth, then it is a fact that this place is almost 200 miles away. Now I suggest that we quietly get into our cars and drive down there at a safe, sound speed, keeping each other in sight of each other. And then when we get down there, we dig up the money - providing there is some money there. And if we do find it, we share it amongst us in a simple manner.
Wealth... Witch... Let's see. Where. Work. That's it, work. I gotta work on where it is.
This is stupid. You call me a ""stupid idiot?"" Well, let me tell you something. You're a ""stupid idiot!""
But he'll go all the way to Plaster City.
So he goes all the way to Plaster City. I don't know about you, but I'm turning this thing around. Now, you wanna catch him? You get out and run!"
Mongo,AC,Dumb Muscle,"Mongo no go. Mongo stay with Sheriff Bart. Sheriff Bart first man ever whip Mongo. Mongo impressed. Have deep feelings for Sheriff Bart.
Uh-oh, Bart. I think Mongo here's taken a liking to you.
Huh-huh, naw, Mongo straight.
Mongo only pawn... in game of life.
Candygram for Mongo! Candygram for Mongo!
Me Mongo.
Sign, please.
Thank you.
Mongo like candy.
... Step right up, ladies and gentlemen and... Mongos! Dive, dive, dive for buried treasure! This is the exact spot where the Spanish Armada was sunk by the British Navy, leaving millions and millions of Spanish Dubloons at the bottom of the sea!
Spanish balloons? Mongo take chance...!
... How Mongo get air?
From this wonderful antique pump. Good hunting!
... Time for my lunch break.
Maybe you know why a high-roller like Hedley Lamarr is interested in Rock Ridge.
Don't know. Got to do with where choo-choo go.
Mongo, why would Hedley Lamarr care about where the choo-choo goes?
Don't know. Mongo only pawn in game of life."
Fezzik,AC,Dumb Muscle,"That Vizzini, he can *fuss*.
Fuss, fuss... I think he like to scream at *us*.
Probably he means no *harm*.
He's really very short on *charm*.
You have a great gift for rhyme.
Yes, yes, some of the time.
Enough of that.
Fezzik, are there rocks ahead?
If there are, we all be dead.
No more rhymes now, I mean it.
Anybody want a peanut?
DYEEAAHHHHHH!
Beat it or I'll call the Brute Squad.
I'm on the Brute Squad.
You ARE the Brute Squad!
Why won't my arms move?
You've been mostly-dead all day.
Who are you? Are we enemies? Why am I on this wall? Where is Buttercup?
Let me explain.
No, there is too much. Let me sum up. Buttercup is marry Humperdinck in little less than half an hour. So all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the princess, make our escape... after I kill Count Rugen.
That doesn't leave much time for dilly-dallying.
You just wiggled your finger. That's wonderful.
I've always been a quick healer. What are our liabilities?
There is but one working castle gate, and... and it is guarded by 60 men.
And our assets?
Your brains, Fezzik's strength, my steel.
Look, are you just fiddling around with me or what?
I just want you to feel you're doing well.
We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.
You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try and kill each other like civilized people?
I could kill you now.
Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting.
It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise.
Why do you wear a mask? Were you burned by acid, or something like that?
Oh no, it's just that they're terribly comfortable. I think everyone will be wearing them in the future.
Do you hear that, Fezzik? That is the sound of ultimate suffering. My heart made that sound when Rugen slaughtered my father. The man in black makes it now.
The man in black?
His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has the cause for ultimate suffering?
You never said anything about killing anyone.
I've hired you to help me start a war. It's an prestigious line of work, with a long and glorious tradition.
I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
Am I going MAD, or did the word ""think"" escape your lips? You were not hired for your brains, you hippopotamic land mass.
I agree with Fezzik.
Oh, the sot has spoken. What happens to her is not truly your concern. I will kill her. And remember this, never forget this: when I found you, you were so slobbering drunk, you couldn't buy brandy!
And YOU: friendless, brainless, helpless, hopeless! Do you want me to send you back to where you were? Unemployed, in Greenland?
Inigo?
What?
I hope we win.
Finish him. Finish him, your way.
Oh good, my way. Thank you Vizzini... what's my way?
Pick up one of those rocks, get behind a boulder, in a few minutes the man in black will come running around the bend, the minute his head is in view, hit it with the rock.
My way's not very sportsman-like.
You know, Fezzik, you finally did something right.
Don't worry, I won't let it go to my head.
Jump in after her!
I don't swim
I only dog paddle.
AGGHH!
Excuse me... Pardon me, please, it's important... Fezzik, please?
EVERYBODY MOVE!
Thank you.
Where is the Man in Black?
Fezzik, jog his memory.
Sorry, Inigo. I didn't mean to jog him so hard.
Oh, what I wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.
There, we cannot help you.
Will this do?
Where did you get that?
At Miracle Max's. It fits so nice, he said I could keep it.
I mean, if we only had a wheelbarrow, that would be something.
Where we did we put that wheelbarrow the albino had?
Over the albino, I think.
Well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place?
You just shook your head... doesn't that make you happy?
My brains, his steel, and your strength against sixty men, and you think a little head-jiggle is supposed to make me happy?
I am waiting for Vizzini.
You surely are a meanie.
Hello.
It's you.
True!
My men are here! I am here! But soon *you* will not be here!
You truly love each other? Then you might have been truly happy! No couple in a century has that chance, no matter what the storybooks say. And so I think no man in a century will suffer as greatly as you will
Not to Fifty!

Fezzik, do you hear that? That is the sound of ultimate suffering. My heart made that sound when Count Rugen killed my father. The Man in Black makes it now.
The Man in Black?
His true love is marry Prince Humperdinck tonight, so who else has cause for ultimate suffering?
Where is this Count Rugen now, so I may kill him?
He's in the castle with the prince. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
How may do you think you could handle?
I don't think more than ten.
Let's go.
Where?
Find the man in black obviously.
But don't you know where he is.
Don't bother me with trifles. After 20 years, at last my father's soul will be at peace. There will be blood tonight!
I just figured why you give me so much trouble.
Why is that
do you think?
Well, I haven't fought one person for so long. I've been specialised in groups, battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.
Why should that make such a
difference?
You use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people, than when you only have to be worried about one
You be careful. People in masks cannot be trusted.
How long do we have to wait, before we know the miracle works?
You're guess is as good as mine.
I'll beat you both apart! I'll take you both together!
I guess not very long."
Karl Childers,AC,Dumb Muscle,"You ever have any brothers or sisters growing up?
I had one there for a little while. But, uh, it didn't get old enough for me to play with it.
Why not? It die?
Yes, Sir.
Why?
It got born too early. My mother and father made it come out too early some how or other.
So it died when it came out?
My daddy came out to the shed and got me. He said, ""Here, take this and throw it away"", and he handed me a towel with something or another in it. Well I started for that barrel and I opened up the towel 'cause there was a noise. Something a-moving around in there. The towel was all bloody-like all around it there. It was a lil' ol' baby not no bigger than a squirrel.
A girl or a boy?
It was a little ol' boy.
You threw it in the trash barrel?
Well that didn't seem right to me, so I went in the shed and got me a shoe box and emptied out all the washers and nuts and screws and whatnot that were in it and I takened the little fellar and put him inside the box and buried him right there in a corner of the yard. That seemed more proper to me, I reckon.
Was it still alive when you buried it?
I heared it a-cryin' through that box.
That don't seem right. Seems like you would have kept him and taken care of him if he was your brother.
I wasn't but 6 or 8. I don't reckon I knew what to do. I didn't know how to care for no baby. My mother and father didn't want him and they learned me to do what they told me. These days I reckon it's better to give him back to the Good Lord anyhow."
Gaear Grimsrud,BC,Psycho For Hire,"Shut the fuck up! Or I'll throw you back in the trunk, you know?
Jesus, that's more than I've heard you say all week.
You're a smooth smoothie, you know?
You ever been to Minneapolis?
Nope.
Would it... kill you to say something?
I did.
""No."" That's the first thing you've said in the last four hours. That's, a fountain of conversation there, buddy. That's a geyser.
You should see the other guy.
What the fuck happened to her?
Uh, she started shrieking, y'know. She wouldn't stop...
Geesus. Well, it doesn't matter. I got the money. All of it. All eighty grand.
That's forty for you, forty for me.
That's it, then. You can have my truck. Here's the keys. I'm takin' the Ciera.
We split that.
How the fuck do you split a fuckin' car, ya dummy? With a fuckin' chainsaw?
One of us pays the other for half.
Hold on! No fuckin' way! You fuckin' notice this? I got fuckin' shot! I got fuckin' shot in the face! I went and got the fuckin' money. I got shot fuckin' picking it up! I've been up for thirty-six fuckin' hours! I'm taking' that fuckin' car! That fucker's mine, you fuckin' asshole!
You know, I've been listening to your fuckin' bullshit all week! Are we square?
Are WE square?
Yeah, ya fuckin' mute. And if you see your friend Shep Proudfoot, tell him I'm gonna nail his fuckin' ass!
Oh no! Aaaaaah!
Where is pancakes house?
What?
We stop at pancakes house.
What... are you nuts? We had pancakes for breakfast. Gotta go to a place I can get a shot and a beer, steak, maybe, not more fuckin' pancakes, c'mon.
Oh, come on, man! Okay, here's an idea: we can stop outside of Brainerd. I know a place there we can get laid. Whaddya think?
I'm fucking hungry now, you know!
Yeah yeah Jesus, I'm sayin' we can... stop, get pancakes and then we'll get laid, alright?
I need unguent.
You see, my wife's dad is real well off.
So, why don't you just ask him for the money?
Or your fucking wife, you know.
Or your fuckin' wife, Jerry?
Well, it's all part of... look, the thing is they don't know that I'm in trouble. My wife and father-in-law don't know I need money. And if they did... I still won't get it. Okay? These are personal matters.
Personal matters? Okay, you're tasking us to perform this mission, but you won't tell us what... oh, fuck it. Let's have a look at the Ciera.
Unguent... I need unguent."
Harlen Maguire,BC,Psycho For Hire,"I'm something of a rarity.
Is that, uh... your profession or... your pleasure?
Both, I guess. To be paid to do what you love... ain't that the dream?
I shoot the dead. Dead bodies, that is. I don't kill them.
Smile.
You ever seen one?
Yeah.
Sorry for you. Terrible thing... but it sure makes you feel alive, don't it?
I'll drink to that."
Mr. Blonde,BC,Psycho For Hire,"Hey Joe, you want me to shoot this guy?
Shit... You shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
Listen kid, I'm not gonna bullshit you, all right? I don't give a good fuck what you know, or don't know, but I'm gonna torture you anyway, regardless. Not to get information. It's amusing, to me, to torture a cop. You can say anything you want cause I've heard it all before. All you can do is pray for a quick death, which you ain't gonna get.
You ever listen to K-Billy's ""Super Sounds of the Seventies"" weekend? It's my personal favorite.
Eddie, you keep talking like a bitch, I'm gonna slap you like a bitch.
What's this guy's problem?
Yeah I got a problem! I got a *big* fuckin' problem. Fuckin' trigger happy madman almost get's me shot!
What the fuck are you talking about?
That fuckin' shooting spree! In the store remember?
Oh fuck 'em. They set off the alarm. They deserved what they got.
You almost killed me! Asshole! If I knew what kind of a guy you were I never would've agreed to work with you!
Are you gonna bark all day little doggie? Or are you gonna bite?
What was that? I'm sorry I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
Are you gonna bark all day little doggie? Or are you gonna bite?
You two assholes, calm the fuck down! Hey, come on! What are we on a playground here? Am I the only professional? You're actin' like a bunch of fuckin' niggers man. Did you ever work with niggers? Just like you two always saying they're gonna kill each other!
You said yourself you thought about takin' him out!
You fuckin' said that?
Yeah, I did, okay? But that was then! Right now this guy is the only I completely trust. He's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops.
You takin' his side?
Fuck sides man what we need here is a little solidarity! Somebody's stickin' a red hot poker up our asses and I wanna know who's name's on the handle. Fuck. Look I know I'm no peice of shit.
And I'm pretty sure you're okay.
And I'm fuckin' positive you're on the level. So let's just try and figure out who the bad guy is, all right?
Let me tell you what 'Like a Virgin' is about. It's all about a girl who digs a guy with a big dick. The entire song. It's a metaphor for big dicks.
No, no. It's about a girl who is very vulnerable. She's been fucked over a few times. Then she meets some guy who's really sensitive...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... Time out Greenbay. Tell that fucking bullshit to the tourists.
Toby... Who the fuck is Toby? Toby...
'Like a Virgin' is not about this sensitive girl who meets a nice fella. That's what ""True Blue"" is about, now, granted, no argument about that.
Which one is 'True Blue'?
'True Blue' was a big ass hit for Madonna. I don't even follow this Tops In Pops shit, and I've at least heard of ""True Blue"".
Look, asshole, I didn't say I ain't heard of it. All I asked was how does it go? Excuse me for not being the world's biggest Madonna fan.
Personally, I can do without her.
I like her early stuff. You know, 'Lucky Star', 'Borderline' - but once she got into her 'Papa Don't Preach' phase, I don't know, I tuned out.
Hey, you guys are making me lose my... train of thought here. I was saying something, what was it?
Oh, Toby was this Chinese girl, what was her last name?
What's that?
I found this old address book in a jacket I ain't worn in a coon's age. What was that name?
What the fuck was I talking about?
You said 'True Blue' was about a nice girl, a sensitive girl who meets a nice guy, and that 'Like a Virgin' was a metaphor for big dicks.
Lemme tell you what 'Like a Virgin' is about. It's all about this cooze who's a regular fuck machine, I'm talking morning, day, night, afternoon, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick.
How many dicks is that?
A lot.
Then one day she meets this John Holmes motherfucker and it's like, whoa baby, I mean this cat is like Charles Bronson in the 'Great Escape', he's digging tunnels. Now, she's gettin' the serious dick action and she's feeling something she ain't felt since forever. Pain. Pain.
Chew? Toby Chew?
It hurts her. It shouldn't hurt her, you know, her pussy should be Bubble Yum by now, but when this cat fucks her it hurts. It hurts just like it did the first time. You see the pain is reminding a fuck machine what it once was like to be a virgin. Hence, 'Like a Virgin'.
Wong?
You can't leave this guy with them.
Why not?
Because he's a fucking psycho. And if you think Joe's pissed off, that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off I am at him, for putting me in the same room as that bastard!
See what I've been putting up with, Eddie? I fucking walked in here, I told these guys about staying put. Mr. White whips out his gun, he's sticking it in my face, calling me a motherfucker, saying he's gonna blow me away and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
He seems okay now, but he was crazy in the store.
This is what he was doing...
Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!
Yeah, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam. I told 'em not to touch the alarm... but they touched it. If they hadn't done what I told 'em not to do, they'd still be alive.
My fucking hero.
Thanks.
That's your excuse for going on a kill-crazy rampage?
I don't like alarms, Mr. White.
Either he's alive or he's dead, or the cops got him... or they don't.
Daddy, did you see that?
What?
Guy got me on the ground, he tried to fuck me.
You wish.
You sick bastard, Vic. You tried to fuck me in my father's office. Look, Vic. Whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go to it. But don't try to fuck me. I mean, I don't think of you that way. I like you a lot, buddy, but I don't think of you that way.
Listen, if I was a butt cowboy, I wouldn't even throw you to the posse.
No you wouldn't, you'd keep me for yourself. You know, four years fuckin' punks up the ass, you appreciate a piece of prime rib when you see it.
I already told you I don't know anything about any fucking setup; you can torture me all you want.
Torture you? That's a good idea. I like that.
Was that as good for you as it was for me?
Listen, I appreciate what, you guys are doin' for me, but I was wonderin' when I can come back and, you know, do some real work.
Well, that's hard to say, It's kind of a strange time now. Things are a little...
They're a little fucked-up is what they are. Listen we got a big meetin' goin' down in Vegas right now.
Just let Eddie for now set you up in Long Beach, get you some cash, Get this Scagnetti fuck off your back, and then we can start talkin' okay? Huh?
Listen daddy, I got an idea. Now just, hear me out. Now, I know you don't like usin' the boys on jobs like these, but Vic has been nothin' but good luck for us. The guy's a fuckin' rabbits foot for cryin' out loud. I'd like to have him in. You know he's reliable and you damn well know trust him.
How would you feel about pulling off a job with about five other guys?
I'd feel great about it.
Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've been here a long fucking time and she's only filled my cup three times. When I order coffee, I want it filled *six* times.
Six times. Well, what if she's too fucking busy?
The words ""too fucking busy"" shouldn't be in a waitress's vocabulary.
Excuse me, Mr. Pink, but I think the last fucking thing you need is another cup of coffee.
Hey what's goin' on? Can you hear that?
Mr. Blonde! What happened to you? We figured you were dead. Hey! You okay? Did you see what happened to Blue? We didn't know what happened to you and Blue, that's what we were wondering about.
Come on! Look, Brown's dead and Orange got it in the belly...
ENOUGH! Enough! You better start talking asshole! Because we got shit we need to talk about! We're already freaked out. We need you acting freaky like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip!
Okay, let's talk.
We're leaving. You should go with us.
Nobody's goin' anywhere.
Piss on this fucking turd! We're outta here.
Guess what, I think I'm parked in the red-zone!
How does freedom feel?
It's a change.
We still gotta get outta here.
We're gonna sit here and wait.
For what, the cops?
Nice Guy Eddie.
Nice Guy Eddie? What makes you think he isn't on a plane half way to Costa Rica?
'Cause I talked to him and he said he was on his way down here.
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why the fuck didn't you say that in the first place?
You didn't ask.
Hardy fuckin' har.
What happened to Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue?
Brown's dead. We don't know what happened to Blue.
Mr. Brown's dead? Are you sure?
I'm sure. I was there. He took one in the head.
Nobody's got a clue what happened to Mr. Blue?
Either he's alive or he's dead. Or the cops got him or they don't.
Gimme that fuckin' thing...
What the hell do ya think you're doin'? Gimme my book back!
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it, Joe. I'll give it back to you when we leave.
Whaddaya mean when we leave? Gimme it back now!
For the past 15 minutes now you've been droning on about names. Toby... Toby... Toby... Toby Wong... Toby Wong, Toby Wong... Toby Chung, fuckin' Charlie Chan. I got Madonna's big dick coming outta my left ear, and Toby the Jap - I dunno what - coming outta my right.
Gimme that book.
Are you gonna put it away?
I'm gonna do whatever the fuck I want with it.
Well then, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to keep it.
Hey Joe... Want me to shoot this guy?
Shit... You shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
Hey, you two assholes knock it the fuck off and calm down! Cut the bullshit. We ain't on a fuckin' playground! I don't beleive this shit. Both of you guys got ten years on me and I'm the only one acting like a professional. You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers. You wanna be niggers, huh? They're just like you two - always fightin' and always sayin' their gonna kill each other...
You said yourself you thought about takin' him out!
You fuckin' said that?
Yeah, I did. But that time has passed. Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I completely trust. He's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops.
You takin' his side?
No, man. Fuck sides! What we need here is a little solidarity! Somebody's shoving a red hot poker up our asses and I wanna find out whose name is on the handle. Now, I know I'm no piece of shit.
And I'm pretty sure you're a good boy.
And I'm fucking positive you're on the level. So let's figure out who the bad guy is.
You kids shouldn't play so rough. Somebody's gonna start cryin'.
Yeah I'm sorry, I should have picked you up myself. This whole week has been fucked up, I've had my head up my ass the whole time.
You know, that's funny, 'cause that's what me and your dad were just talkin' about.
That I should have picked you up?
No, that you got your head up your ass. I mean I walked in here and Joe's like, ""Vic, thank god you're back. My son Eddie's a fuck-up. I mean I love the guy, but he's just flushin' everything down the toilet. He's ruining me."" I mean that's what you said, right Joe? I'm not makin' this up.
I'm sorry you had to hear it like this Eddie. Vic asked me how business was, and you can't lie to a man who's done time for you.
That's very true.
Boy that was really exciting. I bet you're a big Lee Marvin fan aren't ya. Yeah me too. I love that guy. My heart's beatin' so fast I'm about to have a heart attack.
I might break you in, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch.
Please! Please... Don't burn me, man.
You all through? You all through?
Look, I... I got a little kid at home. Now, PLEASE.
No, no, no, no, no, no. You all done? You all done? How 'bout a little fire, Scarecrow?
So who's your parole officer?
Seymour Scagnetti.
What's he like?
He's a fuckin' asshole.
You can't leave these guys here with him.
Why not?
'Cause he's a fucking psycho. And if you think Joe's pissed off, that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off I am at him for putting me in the same room as that bastard!
You see what I've been putting up with, Eddie? I fucking walked in here, told these guys about staying put; Mr. White whips out his gun, he's sticking it in my face, calling me a motherfucker, saying he's gonna blow me away, and blah blah blah blah blah.
He's the reason the joint turned into a shooting spree.
What are you, a fucking silent partner? Tell him!
He went crazy in the store, but him seems all right now.
Freeze! Put the gun down!
Here your name's. Mr. White, Mr. Blonde and Mr. Pink.
Why am I Mr. Pink?
Who cares what your name is.
Easy for you to say your Mr. White you got a cool sounding name.
Let's go to work.
What happens if the Manager doesn't give you the diamonds?
Cut one of his fingers off the little one.
If they haven't done what I told them not to do, they'd still be alive!
Your acting like a first year thief, i'm acting like a Professional!
A guy like can put you in for ten years worth.
BAM!
BAM!
Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam!
Your under arrest sugar!
Hey Joe, want me to shoot this guy?
Hold still! Hold still, you fuck!"
Red Grant,BC,Psycho For Hire,"Red wine with fish. Well, that should have told me something.
You may know the right wines, but you're the one on your knees. How does it feel old man?
The first one won't kill you; not the second, not even the third... not till you crawl over here and you KISS MY FOOT!
""Old man?"" Is that what you chaps in SMERSH call each other?
SMERSH? I'm not with them.
Of course... SPECTRE. So this wasn't a Russian show at all. You've been playing us off against each other, haven't you? So it was SPECTRE who killed that Bulgar agent in the St. Sophia mosque. Was that you?
Uh-huh.
Kerim and the other man?
Uh-huh.
And Nash?
Never mind. Oh, it's not that I don't mind talking. I get a kick out of watching you, the great James Bond, find out what a bloody fool he's been making of himself. We're pros, Mr. Bond. We sweated your little ""may I borrow a match"" recognition code out last month from one of your men in Tokyo before he died. Ever since your arrived in Istanbul, I've been keeping tabs on you. I've even been your guardian angel. Saved your life at the Gypsy camp.
Oh, yes. I'm... much obliged.
Is any of the opposition around?
Not in any condition to be worried about.
We were keeping you alive until you could get us the Lektor.
So, you had me deliver it on a silver plate? That's brilliant. Go on, I'm fascinated.
Now that we've got it, you and the girl are expendable... from here onto Trieste.
The girl? Isn't she working for SPECTRE too?
No. She thinks she's doing it all for Mother Russia. She takes her orders from Colonel Klebb. And so do I.
Rosa Klebb? But Colonel Rosa Klebb is a Russian, head of operations for SMERSH.
Correction: was. Klebb works for SPECTRE now. The girl doesn't know that.
But why kill her?
Orders. That's only half of it, old man.
Here's a roll of film. She'll have this in her handbag. And on you they'll find this letter. It's from her, threatening to give the film to the press unless you marry her for helping you steal the Lektor.
What film?
Taken in the bridal suite at your hotel. Something else the girl didn't know about... or you."
Anton Chigurh,BC,Psycho For Hire,"What's the most you ever lost on a coin toss.
Sir?
The most. You ever lost. On a coin toss.
I don't know. I couldn't say.
Call it.
Call it?
Yes.
For what?
Just call it.
Well, we need to know what we're calling it for here.
You need to call it. I can't call it for you. It wouldn't be fair.
I didn't put nothin' up.
Yes, you did. You've been putting it up your whole life you just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin?
No.
1958. It's been traveling twenty-two years to get here. And now it's here. And it's either heads or tails. And you have to say. Call it.
Look, I need to know what I stand to win.
Everything.
How's that?
You stand to win everything. Call it.
Alright. Heads then.
Well done.
Don't put it in your pocket, sir. Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter.
Where do you want me to put it?
Anywhere not in your pocket. Where it'll get mixed in with the others and become just a coin. Which it is.
You don't have to do this.
People always say the same thing.
What do they say?
They say, ""You don't have to do this.""
You don't.
Okay.
This is the best I can do. Call it.
I knowed you was crazy when I saw you sitting there. I knowed exactly what was in store for me.
Call it.
No. I ain't gonna call it.
Call it.
The coin don't have no say. It's just you.
Well, I got here the same way the coin did.
How much?
Sixty-nine cent.
This. And the gas.
Y'all gettin' any rain up your way?
What way would that be?
I seen you was from Dallas.
What business is it of yours where I'm from, friendo?
I didn't mean nothin' by it.
Didn't mean nothin'.
I was just passin' the time. If you don't wanna accept that I don't know what else to do for you. Will there be something else?
I don't know. Will there?
Is somethin' wrong?
With what?
With anything?
Is that what you're asking me? Is there something wrong with anything?
Will there be anything else?
You already asked me that.
Well... I need to see about closin'.
See about closing.
Yessir.
What time do you close?
Now. We close now.
Now is not a time. What time do you close?
Are you going to shoot me?
That depends. Do you see me?
And you know what's going to happen now. You should admit your situation. There would be more dignity in it.
You go to hell.
Alright. Let me ask you something. If the rule you followed brought you to this, of what use was the rule?
Do you have any idea how crazy you are?
You mean the nature of this conversation?
I mean the nature of you.
Hello?
Yes?
Is uh, Carson Wells there?
Not in the sense that you mean. You need to come see me.
Who is this?
You know who it is. You need to talk to me.
I don't need to talk to you.
I think you do. Do you know where I'm going?
Why would I care where you're going?
I know where you are.
Yeah? Where am I?
You're in the hospital across the river, but that's not where I'm going. Do you know where I'm going?
Yeah, I know where you're going.
Alright.
You know she won't be there.
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
So what are you going up there for?
You know how this is going to turn out, don't you?
Nope.
I think you do. So this is what I'll offer - you bring me the money and I'll let her go. Otherwise she's accountable, same as you. That's the best deal you're gonna get. I won't tell you you can save yourself, because you can't.
Would you hold still, please, sir?
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
Did you go up to his trailer?
Yes, I did.
Well, I'd say he's at work. Do you want to leave a message?
Where does he work?
I can't say.
Where does he work?
Sir, I ain't at liberty to give out no information about our residents.
Where does he work?
Did you not hear me? We can't give out no information.
I ain't got the money. What little I had is long gone, and there's bills aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. Can't pay for that neither.
I wouldn't worry about it.
I need to sit down.
Who are you?
Me?
Yes.
Nobody... accounting.
He gave the Mexicans a receiver.
He feels... he felt that the more people looking
That's foolish. You pick the one right tool.
I see. Are you going to shoot me?
That depends. Do you see me?
That's a dead dog.
Yes it is.
Step out of your car, please.
Mister? You got a bone stickin' out of your arm.
Let me just sit here a minute."
Jackson Rippner,BC,Psycho For Hire,"You're a spy. I should've known.
No, no. I'm not a spy.
A hitman?
I'm a lousy shot.
Right. You work for the CIA?
Well if I did I couldn't say could I... but no.
The mafia?
The money's shit.
That was very clever, Leese. Taking some stress management courses? When we get out of this, I may have to steal you.
Is it Jack for short?
No. I haven't gone by Jack since I was ten years old.
Last name's Rippner.
Jack Rippner... Jack theee... oooohhhh.
There you go.
That wasn't very nice of your parents.
That's what I told them. Before I killed them.
So what is it you do?
Government overthrows, flashy high-profile assassinations. The usual.
O.K. Why don't you just tell me what you do?
I already did.
Sometimes bad things happen to good people.
Lisa, whatever female-driven, emotion-based dilemma you may be dealing with right now, you have my sympathy. But for the sake of time and sanity, let's break this down into a little male-driven fact-based logic. One simple phone call saves your dad's life.
Excuse me! This is not a motel!
Sure.
Whatever you do, it's your own buisness, just as long as you're not...
What?
...high-jacking the plane.
Oh!
No, I'm not suicidal.
That's good.
And you're right, most days it is my buisness. But as faith would have it, my buisness is all about you.
Okay, I'm not quite sure where you're going with this.
Charles Keefe, VIP, one of your regulars. Ring a bell?
No, should it?
Yes, it should because right now he's on his way to your hotel and that's why you need to keep listening.
No, I don't think I need to do that!
Yes you do if you want your father to live.
You know what I think?
I think you're not such an honest person. Because I've been following you for eight weeks now, and I never once saw you order anything but a fucking Sea Breeze!
So, what are the odds, huh?
Yeah, I know.
Wait a minute. You're not stalking me, are you?
Please, just stop whoever's outside my dad's house!
I already have, by twice intercepting these little communiques! You know, if they'd have fallen into the hands of a by-the-book stewardess, she'd have gone straight to the cockpit and we'd have landed somewhere else! If that happens, Leese, our guy in the BMW's gonna know about it, so do Dad a favor and stop gambling with his life!
Pretty clear thinking given the circumstances. Wait, let me guess, some stress management courses? They're really paying off. When we get out of this, I may have to steal you.
I'll finish the job.
Not in my house.
I need you to do something for me.
Are you sure you're OK?
Cynthia, please don't ask me again if I'm OK.
Something's come up. We need to change Keefe's room. Can you pull up the file?
Were going to move him to room 4080, and then I need you to...
Hello? Cynthia?
What's wrong now?
You hit me in the head and slammed me against the wall, remember?
Oh, suck it up. You've come too far - don't blow it now.
Thanks for distracting me.
That's not really what I was doing.
What were you doing then?
Just keeping the focus on you and your father.
One phone call saves your dad's life.
That's actually my seat.
You're kidding.
Well, I don't know. That says 18G.
You're not kidding.
Before you do that you may want to look at this.
J.R. Joe Reisert. Your father.
Where did you get that?
An associate of mine grabbed it off your dad's desk... I believe it was next to your graduation picture. J.R. his wallet, his initials. But gee, mine too. And for some reason, stewardess, this strange and rather inebriated girl whom I've never met before tonight suddenly went crazy when I took it out of my pocket.
You tell the flight attendant and your dad dies.
What can I do for you?
Leese, did you need another pillow or anything?
No, I don't need anything.
She's just had a really rough day. A death in the family.
You know what I think? I think you're not such an honest person. Because I've followed you for eight weeks now and I never once saw you order anything but a fucking seabreeze!
I can't breathe... I can't breathe
Thanks for the quickie.
She's exhausted, she's worked for 18 hours, and she suspects that we all hate her just as much as you do. So why you don't just give her a break? Let her go back to her job which I'm guessing is a lot more thankless than yours.
This airline *SUCKS*!
No, my grandmother died.
Oh.
It's ok. She was ninety-one.
Ninety-one?
Yea.
That's respectable. What was her secret?
Grapenuts. And a guy named Duke.
Excuse me?
Yea, uh, she said the Grapenuts kept her arteries clean and... Duke helped with the rest.
It's time."
Staff Sergeant Robert Barnes,"AA, BC","Drill Sargeant Nasty, Psycho For Hire","Oh, man. Is that what I think it is?
All right, you cheese-dicks, welcome to the Nam. Follow me!
Oh, man. Is that what I think it is?
All right, you cheese-dicks, welcome to the Nam. Follow me!"
George Higgins,BC,Psycho For Hire,"You know the best part of killing someone? The look on their face. It's that look. Not when they're threatened. Not when you hurt them. Not even when they see the knife. It's when they feel the knife go in. That's it. It's surprise. They just can't believe it's really happening to them. She had that look, the girl, when she knew it wasn't just porno.
What were you expecting? A monster?
There's no mystery. Things I do, I do them because I like them! Because I want to!"
Major Arnold Toht,BC,Psycho For Hire,"Good evening, Fraulein.
The bar's closed.
We are... hehe... not thirsty.
Wait, wait! I can be reasonable!
That time has passed.
You don't need that. I'll tell you everything!
Yes, I know you will.
What do you want?
Ah, the same thing your friend Dr. Jones wanted. Surely he mentioned there would be other interested parties?
Must have slipped his mind.
The man is nefarious. I hope for your sake that he has not yet acquired it.
Why, are you willing to offer more?
Oh, almost certainly. Do you still have it?
No.
Your fire is dying... here, why don't you tell me where the piece is right now?
Listen, Herr Mac, I don't know what kind of people you're used to dealing with, but nobody tells me what to do in my place.
Fräulein Ravenwood, let me show you what I am used to...
Now... what shall we talk about?
We meet again, Fraulein. You Americans, you're all the same. Always overdressing for the wrong occasions.
Who knows. Perhaps the Ark is still waiting in some antechamber for us to discover. Perhaps there's some vital bit of evidence which eludes us. Perhaps...
Perhaps the girl can help us.
My feeling exactly. She was in possession of the original piece for years. She may know much if... properly motivated.
I tell you the girl knows nothing.
I am surprised to find you squeamish. That is not your reputation. Anyway, it needn't concern you. I have the perfect man for this kind of work.
Heil Hitler.
Shoot them. Shoot them both."
Mortimer Brewster,BC,Psycho For Hire,"Look I probably should have told you this before but you see... well... insanity runs in my family... It practically gallops.
No, no. I'm not a Brewster. I'm the son of a sea-cook! Ha! Ha! Chaaaaarrrge!
And I'm not a cab driver, I'm a coffee pot!
But Mortimer, you're going to love me for my mind, too.
One thing at a time!
For a gallon of elderberry wine, I take one teaspoon full of arsenic, then add half a teaspoon full of strychnine, and then just a pinch of cyanide.
Hmm. Should have quite a kick.
The name Brewster is code for Roosevelt.
Code for Roosevelt?
Yes. Don't you see? Take the name Brewster, take away the B, and what have you got?
Rooster!
Uh-huh. And what does a rooster do?
Crows.
It crows. And where do you hunt in Africa?
On the veldt!
There you are: crows - veldt!
Ingenious! My compliments to the boys in the code department.
Aunt Abby, how can I believe you? There are twelve men down in the cellar and you admit you poisoned them.
Yes, I did. But you don't think I'd stoop to telling a fib.
When I come back, I expect to find you gone. Wait for me!
Look, you can't do things like that! Now, I don't know how I can explain this to you. But, it's not only against the law, its wrong!
Oh, piffle!
It's not a nice thing to do. People wouldn't understand. He wouldn't understand. What I mean is... Well... This is developing into a very bad habit!
Mr. President, may I have the pleasure of presenting...
Doctor Livingston?
Livingstone?
Uh, well, that's what he presumes.
Hello... Operator? Can you hear my voice? You can? Are you sure?
Well, then I must be here.
But, darling - Niagara Falls.
It does? Well, let it.
Who are you? What's your name?
Well, usually I'm Mortimer Brewster, but I'm not quite myself today.
I saw a play last week, it had a character in it, reminded me of Jonathon.
Oh, really?
Yeah, a honey of a lunatic. One of those whodunits called ""Murder Will Out"".
Oh, dear!
Yeah, what a play. When the curtain goes up the first thing you see is a dead body. The next thing...
Ye, Gods! There's another one!
Hey! $22.50!
What?
$22.50!
Oh, yes, looks good on you!
Yeah. Not the suit, the meter!
Look, Aunt Martha, men don't just get into window seats and die!
We know, dear. He died first.
Wait a minute! Stop all this. Now, look, darling, how did he die?
Oh, Mortimer, don't be so inquisitive. The gentleman died because he drank some wine with poison in it.
How did the poison get in the wine?
Well, we put it in wine, because it's less noticeable. When it's in tea, it has a distinct odor.
You mean, you... You put it in the wine!
Yes. And I put Mr. Hoskins in the window seat, because Reverend Harper was coming.
Now, look at me, darling. You mean, you mean you knew what you'd done and you didn't want the Reverend Harper to see the body?
Well, not at tea. That wouldn't have been very nice.
Oh, it's first-degree.
Now, Mortimer, you know all about it and just forget about it. I do think that Aunt Martha and I have the right to our own little secrets.
He sits there *waiting* to be tied up and gagged!
The big dope!
Where did you get that face? Hollywood?
Now, Jonathon. Be a good fellow. Here's ten dollars. Go out and haunt yourself a hotel?
Even the cat's in on it!
Is he trying to move into the White House before I've moved out?
Who?
Taft!
Hey, you! Five more bucks and you'll own it!
Oh, no thanks! It wouldn't fit me!
I probably should have told you this before but, you see, well... insanity runs in my family.
It practically gallops!
What is this? Did everybody in Brooklyn know I was going to get married except me?
We knew you'd find out about it in time.
Go on - fight, fight. I don't care.
Oh, don't do that. It never works.
What do you know? it worked!
At least people in plays act like they've got sense.
Oh, you think so? Did you ever see anybody in a play act like they got any intelligence?
How can somebody be so stupid!
Yeah, yeah, I know that bromide. Something borrowed, something blue - old, new! Rice and old shoes, carry you over the threshold, Niagara Falls - all the silly tripe I've made fun of for years. Is this what I've come to? I can't go through with it. I won't marry you and that's that!
Yes, Mortimer.
What do you mean, ""Yes, Mortimer""? Aren't you insulted? Aren't you going to cry? Aren't you going to make a scene?
No, Mortimer.
And don't ""No, Mortimer"" me either! Don't... Don't you see, marriage is a superstition, it... It's old-fashioned, it's... I... Ohhhh...
Now, wait a minute! Listen! You can't marry me one minute and throw me out of the house the next.
I am not throwing you out of the house, I am not throwing you out of the house! Will you get out of here?
Mortimer!
I'm sorry, Judge. But a thing happened. Look, Judge... About Teddy... you see, he's...
Mortimer!
You see, Judge, it's his bugle blowing. Yes, the neighbors have been complaining, and the police are all set to throw him into a state institution.
How do you like that...
I read an ad here about a room to rent...
Oh, shut up!
You wouldn't want to have children with three heads, would you? I mean, you wouldn't want to set up housekeeping in a padded cell. Oh, it would be bad.
All I did was cross the bridge and I was in Brooklyn. Amazing.
You didn't want the reverend to see the body?
Well, not at tea. That wouldn't have been very nice.
Pull up a tombstone!
But there's a body in the window seat!
Yes, dear, we know.
You know?
Of course!
Yes, but it has nothing to do with Teddy. Now, Mortimer, you just forget about it. Forget you ever saw the gentleman.
Forget?
We never dreamed you'd peek.
What the...?
Just the thought of Jonathan frightens me. Do you remember how he used to cut worms in two with his teeth?
Oh, Jonathan? He's probably in prison or hanged or something by now.
Wait outside.
But it's Halloween!
Oh, don't worry about Halloween. The pixies won't be out till after midnight.
Now look, darling, how did he die?
Oh, Mortimer, don't be so inquisitive. The gentleman died because he drank some wine with poison in it.
Well, how did the poison get in the wine?
Well, we put in wine because it's less noticeable. When it's in tea it has a distinct odor.
Now, where was I? Twelve... *TWELVE*?
Come here. I've got the two nicest Aunts in the world. Of course, you've got the nicest nephew in the world, too.
Let me see, now. This is eleven, isn't it, Abby?
Oh, no, dear. This makes twelve.
Abby, dear. I think you're wrong. This one is only eleven.
No, dear, because I remember when Mr. Hoskins first came in, it occurred to me that he'd make just an even dozen.
But, Abby, dear. I really don't think you should count the first one.
Oh, I was counting the first one, and that makes it twelve.
It does? Well, she's probably right. Abby usually is. I get them mixed up sometimes.
Makes it twelve? Twelve.
Oh, uh, Mr. President, may I have the pleasure of introducing...
Dr. Livingstone!
Livingstone?
Yeah, well, that's what he presumes.
Mortimer! Right out here in the open with everyone looking?
Yes, right out here in the open with everyone looking. Let everyone in Brooklyn over sixteen look!
But - what happened to him?
He died.
Certainly there are thirteen bodies in the cellar and there are hundreds more in the attic!
If you tell O'Hara what's in the window seat, I'll tell him what's in the cellar.
Cellar?
There's an elderly gentleman down there who seems to be very dead.
There is a Happydale, far, far away...
Yes, operator, I'd like the Happy Dale Sanatorium, Happy Dale, New York. Come on, operator, what's taking so long? They're just across the river. I could swim it faster! No, I don't want the Happy Dale Laundry. I want the Happy Dale Sanatorium. Sanatorium, sanatorium, sanatorium. Yes, yes, like a broken record. Hello - what? They're busy? Busy? Look, they're busy and you're dizzy. No, I am not drunk, madam, but you've given me an idea.
Stop underplaying, I can't hear you!
You... Get out of here! D'ya wanna be poisoned? D'ya wanna be murdered? D'ya wanna be killed?
Mr. Brewster?
Now, look... Goodbye, dear.
What news have you brought me?
Just this, Mr. President, the country is squarely behind you.
Yes, I know.
Hmm! Hmm!
What, hmm hmm?
The hat!
Argh!"
Col. Paul Tanner,BC,Psycho For Hire,"Hello, sirs. No need for concern. It's only me... the twisted psycho."
Bullet Tooth Tony,BC,Psycho For Hire,"Should I call you Bullet? Tooth?
You can call me Susan if it makes you happy.
A bookie's got blagged last night.
Blagged? Speak English to me, Tony. I thought this country spawned the fucking language, and so far nobody seems to speak it.
So, you are obviously the big dick. The men on the side of ya are your balls. Now there are two types of balls. There are big brave balls, and there are little mincey faggot balls.
These are your last words, so make them a prayer.
Now, dicks have drive and clarity of vision, but they are not clever. They smell pussy and they want a piece of the action. And you thought you smelled some good old pussy, and have brought your two little mincey faggot balls along for a good old time. But you've got your parties muddled up. There's no pussy here, just a dose that'll make you wish you were born a woman. Like a prick, you are having second thoughts. You are shrinking, and your two little balls are shrinking with you. And the fact that you've got ""Replica"" written down the side of your guns...
And the fact that I've got ""Desert Eagle point five O""...
Written down the side of mine...
Should precipitate your balls into shrinking, along with your presence. Now... Fuck off!
Boris the Blade? As in Boris the Bullet-Dodger?
Why do they call him the Bullet-Dodger?
'Cause he dodges bullets, Avi.
You should never underestimate the predictability of stupidity.
Tony.
What?
Look in the dog.
What do you mean ""look in the dog?""
I mean open him up.
It's not as if it's a tin of baked beans! What do you mean ""open him up""?
Avi, pull your socks up.
What's Boris doing here? Boris, what are you doing here?
Fuck you!
Where's the case?
Uhhh, you piece of crap...
Don't take the piss, Boris.
I show you...
Fuck you!
Almost had it...
For fuck's sake...
This guy's a handful.
I hate Russians. I'll take care of him.
He's all yours, Rosebud me old son.
Not a problem.
You gotta get me to a doctor! Shoot that fuck, then get me to a doctor!
Yeah, yeah, but first the stone, Rosie. First the stone and then I'm gonna get you to a doctor, and not just any doctor, boychik, I'm gonna find you a nice Jewish doctor.
Find my friend a nice Jewish doctor!
What about Tony?
You know, Bullet Tooth Tony.
Who's Bullet Tooth...?
Tony!
You silly fuck.
He's a liability.
He'll find you Moses and the burning bush, if you pay him to.
You are gonna die, Tony!
He got shot six times, had the bullets molded into gold.
I shoot you, you go down!
He's got two in his teeth that Dad did for him. So he loves Dad.
Why don't you fucking die!
He's the best chance you got of finding Franky.
Six times?
In one sitting.
You're in trouble now!
Russians.
Russians. I should've known. Anti-Semite, slippery Cossack sluts. What do you know about this goyim?
Ex-KGB cancer. He was a highly trained undercover agent. He'll be impossible to track down.
Yeah.
Dad, there's a strange man down here who wants to sell us an 84-carat stone.
Where does he come from?
I don't know, it's hard to tell. He's got a thick Russian accent.
Tony, there is a man I'd like you to find.
Well, that depends on all the elements in the equation. How many are there?
Forty thousand.
Where was he last seen?
At a bookie's.
A bookie's... pass us the blower, Susi.
I want to know who blagged Brick-Top's bookies.
Do me a favor, Ton!
I will do you a favor, Mullet. I'll not get out of this car and bash the living fuck out of you in front of all your girlfriends.
Got to make it worth my while, mate. Jesus, Tony, you know that...
Comfortable, Mullet? It seems sadly ironic that it's that tie that's got you into this pickle. Now you just take all the time you want.
What the fuck are you doing, Ton?
I'm driving down the street with your head stuck in my window. What do you think I'm doing, you pen-ass?
Slow down, Ton.
You been using dogshit for toothpaste, Mullet?
Slow down, Ton! Slow down, Tony!
I don't think I'll slow down. I think I'll speed up. You can play some music if you like.
Oh, I love this track.
I think...
Yes, Mullet?
I think it's two black guys, in a pawn shop on Smith street.
You better not be telling me porky pies.
I'm fucking telling you, it's two black guys who work off a pawn shop in fucking Smith Street!
That's very effective, Tony. It's not too subtle, but effective.
Are we taking him with us?
I'm driving down the road with your head stuck in my window. What does it look like I'm doin'?
All right, Mullet?
How you doin', Tony? You all right, mate?
Ooh, nice tie.
I heard you weren't about much these days, Tony.
What do you know? Still warm, the blood that courses through my veins. Unlike yours, Mullet.
Who's Bullet Tooth...
Tony.
You silly fuck.
Now I don't want to put a bullet in your face, but if you don't give us *exactly* what we want, there will be fucking murder.
What's your name?
Shoot him.
Ooh.
How do you wanna get rid of him?
Well, do you want to shoot him?
That's a little noisy, isn't it?
Well, do you want to stab him?
Well, that's a little cold-blooded, isn't it?
Do you want to kill him, or not?"
Waingro,BC,Psycho For Hire,"Who are you?
Waingro. My name's Waingro.
I've been living in the office day and night, how well do you know him?
Oh, we took some major scores together.
How come I haven't heard from him?
Well, he's probably busy right now. But he's real thorough. He ain't gon' forget about you.
Oh that's reassuring.
Anyone want some pie?
I gotta go use the john.

I had to get it on. He was making a move. *I had to get it on.*


Split's in the car. Took it out of ours, evenly. To make up for his full end. Because I want to pay off and get rid of this motherfucker right now.



HOLD IT!



Look at me. *Look at me!*

Look at me!




Here we go.
211! 211! We're being held up!
211, armored car...
There's the call. Three minutes.
Clear!
80 seconds left!
Get back. Get back!
Hey slick, see that shit comin' outta their ears? They can't fucking hear you! Cool it!
All right guys! Let's go!
You had to fuck with me.
You wanna fuck with me?
yeah?
security, there's a fire on three, we have to evacuate all floors.
I can't leave here
look, why don't we just talk about this a bit, brother?
Hey baby, time to go.
Showed you a good time, didn't I?
Oh yeah. You fly. You cool.
You're lying to me. I can always tell when people lie to me.
I ain't lying. You're a hot dog. A regular rodeo rider. And this was the monster fuck of my young life.
Want some pie brother?
you guys always work together?
all the time
real tight crew huh?
real tight
yeah if this works good I'd consider going again you know?
stop talking ok, slick?

ok
just crossed over the number one lane, three hundred yards from you now
get set
I am
here we go
what the fuck were you doing?
the guy was making a move
dumb mother fucker
so where you been?
in the SHU at Pelican Bay, B- wing

I'm a cowboy, looking for anything ""heavy"", that guy told me to come see you, that is why I am here
why don't you call this guy, he's always looking for extra help.
thank you, brother.
He was making a move, I had to ""get it on."""
Jack Wilson,BC,Psycho For Hire,"So you're Jack Wilson.
What's that mean to you, Shane?
I've heard about you.
What have you heard, Shane?
I've heard that you're a low-down Yankee liar.
Prove it.
I like Starrett, too. I'll kill him if I have to. I tell you, I'll kill him if I have to.
You mean I'll kill him if you have to.
Why don't we just gun him and get on with it. One's run already, it won't take much to stampede the rest."
Isaacs,BC,Psycho For Hire,"Marissa, did she turn out as you hoped?
Better.
Run little piggy!"
Frank,BC,Psycho For Hire,"How can you trust a man that wears both a belt and suspenders? Man can't even trust his own pants.
Morton once told me I could never be like him. Now I understand why. Wouldn't have bothered him, knowing you were around somewhere alive.
So, you found out you're not a businessman after all.
Just a man.
An ancient race. Other Mortons'll be along, and they'll kill it off.
The future don't matter to us. Nothing matters now - not the land, not the money, not the woman. I came here to see you, 'cause I know that now you'll tell me what you're after.
Only at the point of dyin'.
What do you want? Who are ya?
Dave Jenkins.
Dave Jenkins is dead a long time ago.
Calder Benson.
What's your name? Benson's dead, too.
You ought to know, Frank, better than anyone. You killed 'em.
Who are you?
Jim Cooper, Chuck Youngblood.
More dead men.
They were all alive until they met you, Frank.
Your friends have a high mortality rate, Frank. First three, then two.
So, YOU'RE the one who makes appointments.
And you're the one who doesn't keep 'em.
Keep your lovin' brother happy.
What are we going to do with this one, Frank?
Now that you've called me by name?
You'll never succeed in becoming like me.
Why?
Because there are many things you'll never understand.
This is one of 'em. You see, Frank, there are many kinds of weapons, and the only one that can stop that is this.
Now, shall we get back to our little problem?
My weapons might look simple to you, Mr. Morton, but they can still shoot holes big enough for our little problems.
How does it feel sitting behind that desk, Frank?
It's almost like holding a gun... only much more powerful.
Surprised to see me here?
I knew you'd come.
You paid five thousand dollars for something belongs to me.
Five thousand...
...plus one.
You got a right to make a profit, too.
You've made a big mistake, Morton. When you're not on that train, you look like a turtle out of its shell. It's funny. Poor cripple talkin' big so nobody'll know how scared ya are.
Is that sufficient to make you feel stronger?
I could squash you like a wormy apple.
Sure, but you won't do it... because it's not to... your advantage.
Hmm. Who knows how far you'd have gone with two good legs, huh?
Pick any method you like, just make the deal.
Which deal, Frank? We have more than one, you and me.
I got on board within sight of the Atlantic, and before my eyes close I want to see the blue of the Pacific outside that window.
I know where you got on. I was there too remember? To remove small obstacles from the track you said. Well there were a few.
Not bad. Congratulations. Tell me, was it necessary that you kill all of them? I only told you to scare them!
People scare better when they're dyin'."
Qui-Gon Jinn,AW,Master Swordsman,"There's always a bigger fish.
You're a Jedi Knight, aren't you?
What makes you think that?
I saw your laser sword. Only Jedi carry that kind of weapon.
Perhaps I killed a Jedi and took it from him.
I don't think so. No one can kill a Jedi.
I wish that were so.
But Master Yoda says I should be mindful of the future.
But not at the expense of the moment.
Remember, concentrate on the moment. Feel, don't think. Trust your instincts.
You must have Jedi reflexes if you race pods.
Don't do that again.
Remember: Your focus determines your reality.
Ooh mooey mooey I love you!
You almost got us killed! Are you brainless?
I spake!
The ability to speak does not make you intelligent. Now get out of here.
I can only protect you, I cannot fight a war for you.
How are you going to pay for all this?
I have twenty thousand Republic dataries.
Republic credits? Republic credits are no good out here. I need something more real.
I don't have anything else...
But credits will do fine.
No, they won't-a.
Credits will do fine.
No, they won't-a! What? You think you're some kind of Jedi, waving your hand around like that? I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks don't work on me. Only money. No money, no parts, no deal!
Master Qui-Gon. More to say have you?
With your permission, my master, I have encountered a vergence in the Force.
A vergence, you say?
Located around a person?
A boy. His cells have the highest concentration of midi-chlorians I have seen in a life-form. It was possible he was concieved by the midi-chlorians.
You refer to the prophecy of The One who will bring balance to the Force. You believe it's this boy?
May the force be with you.
Are you sure about this? Trusting our fate to a boy we hardly know? The Queen will not approve.
The Queen does not need to know.
Well, I don't approve.
Uhh, it's too late, it...
No!
Obi-Wan, promise... Promise me you will train the boy.
Yes, master.
He is the chosen one. He will bring balance. Train him.
But what about mom? Is she free too? You're coming too, aren't you mom?
I tried to free your mother Anni, but Watto wouldn't have it.
Son, my place is here, my future is here. It is time for you to let go.
Finding him was the will of the force, I have no doubt of that.
Keep your concentration here and now, where it belongs.
Captain.
Yes, sir?
Tell them we wish to board at once.
With all due respect, the ambassadors for the Supreme Chancellor wish to board immediately.
Yes, of course. As you know, our blockade is perfectly legal and we'd be happy to receive the ambassadors.
I'm not allowed to train you, so I want you watch me and be mindful. Always remember, your focus determines your reality.
He had all the lightsaber fighting capabilities and the moves of the Jedi, only faster and more agressive. My only conclusion... is that it was a Sith lord.
Impossible! The Sith are extinct! They have been for nearly a millenium.
I agree. The Sith would not have returned without us sensing it.
Hard to see, the dark side is. We must investigate further before drawing a conclusion to the idenity of your adversary.
Anakin Skywalker, meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.
I need to speak to the Jedi Council. The situation has become much more complicated.
Greed can be a very powerful ally.
I don't presume...
But you do! Revealed, your opinion is.
Let's get out of here before more droids show up
More? More did you spake?
What are midi-chlorians?
Midi-chlorians are a microscopic life form that resides within all living cells.
He owes me what you call a Life Debt.
Binks? Yousa been havin' the life play with thissen hissen?
Uh-huh.
Blurublurublu! Be gone with him!
Count me outa this one. Better dead here than dead at the core. Ye Gods! What is mesa sayin'?
My forgotten, da Bosses will do terrible tings to me TERRRRRIBLE is me going back der!
Do you hear that?
Yeah.
That is the sound of a thousand terrible things headed this way.
If they find us, they will crush us, grind us into TINY pieces and BLAST us into oblivion!
Hmmm... yousa point is well seen.
I have... acquired a pod in a game of chance. The fastest ever built.
I hope you didn't kill anyone I know for it.
I want to see your spaceship the moment the race is over.
Patience, my blue friend.
Can you help him?
I don't know. I didn't actually come here to free slaves.
Anakin! Tell them to take off!
Where wesa goin?
Don't worry. The Force will guide us.
Ohh, maxi big da Force. Well dat smells stinkowiff.
You and the Naboo form a symbiont circle, what happens to one of you affects the other, you must understand this.
There is something else behind all this, Your Highness. There's no logic in the Federation's move here. My feelings tell me they will destroy you.
Do not defy the council, Master, not again.
I shall do what I must, Obi-Wan.
I have a bad feeling about this.
I don't sense anything.
It's not about the mission, Master. It's something... elsewhere. Elusive.
These Federation types are cowards. The negotiations will be short.
He can see things before they happen. That's why he appears to have such quick reflexes. It's a Jedi trait.
Your Highness, under the circumstances, I suggest you come to Coruscant with us.
Thank you, Ambassador. But my place is with my people.
They will kill you if you stay.
No again! No again! The beings hereabouts are kwazy! We shall be robbed and crunched!
Not likely, we have nothing of value. That's our problem."
Obi-Wan Kenobi,AW,Master Swordsman,"But Master Yoda says I should be mindful of the future.
But not at the expense of the moment.
Why do I get the feeling that we've picked up another pathetic life form?
The boy is dangerous. They all sense it, why can't you?
Uhh, it's too late, it...
No!
Obi-Wan, promise... Promise me you will train the boy.
Yes, master.
He is the chosen one. He will bring balance. Train him.
Dis is nutsen
Oh Gooberfish
Why were you banished Jar-Jar?
It's a longo taleo buta small part of it would be mesa... clumsy
You were banished because you were clumsy?
Yousa might'n be sayin dat
The council has granted me permission to train you. You will be a Jedi, I promise.
My forgotten, da Bosses will do terrible tings to me TERRRRRIBLE is me going back der!
Do you hear that?
Yeah.
That is the sound of a thousand terrible things headed this way.
If they find us, they will crush us, grind us into TINY pieces and BLAST us into oblivion!
Hmmm... yousa point is well seen.
You were right about one thing, master. The negotiations were short.
We haven't much time.
You were banished because you were clumsy?
Do not defy the council, Master, not again.
I shall do what I must, Obi-Wan.
I have a bad feeling about this.
I don't sense anything.
It's not about the mission, Master. It's something... elsewhere. Elusive.
Once those droids take control of the surface, they will take control of you."
Darth Vader,AW,Master Swordsman,"Apology accepted, Captain Needa.
What is thy bidding, my master?
There is a great disturbance in the Force.
I have felt it.
We have a new enemy. The young Rebel who destroyed the Death Star. I have no doubt this boy is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker.
How is that possible?
Search your feelings, Lord Vader. You will know it to be true. He could destroy us.
He's just a boy. Obi-Wan can no longer help him.
The Force is strong with him. The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi.
If he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally.
Yes... He would be a great asset. Can it be done?
He will join us or die, master.
Calrissian. Take the princess and the Wookie to my ship.
You said they'd be left at the city under my supervision!
I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further.
Impressive. Most impressive. Obi-Wan has taught you well. You have controlled your fear. Now, release your anger. Only your hatred can destroy me.
Luke, you can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is your destiny. Join me, and together we can rule the galaxy as father and son.
What if he doesn't survive? He's worth a lot to me.
The Empire will compensate you, if he dies. Put him in.
There will be a substantial reward for the one who finds the Millennium Falcon. You are free to use any methods necessary, but I want them alive. No disintegrations.
As you wish.
You are beaten. It is useless to resist. Don't let yourself be destroyed as Obi-Wan did.
Oh. They've encased him in Carbonite. He should be quite well protected. If he survived the freezing process, that is.
Well, Calrissian, did he survive?
Yes, he's alive, and in perfect hibernation.
He's all yours, bounty hunter. Reset the chamber for Skywalker.
The force is with you, young Skywalker, but you are not a Jedi yet.
Yes, Admiral?
Our ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, Lord. But it has entered an asteroid field and we can not risk...
Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral! I want that ship, not excuses!
Lord Vader, the fleet has moved out of lightspeed and we're preparing to...
You have failed me for the last time, Admiral! Captain Piett?
Yes, my lord?
Make ready to land our troops beyond their energy field, and deploy the fleet, so that nothing gets off the system.
You are in command now... Admiral Piett!
Thank you, Lord Vader.
We would be honored if you would join us.
You have learned much, young one.
You'll find I'm full of surprises.
Lord Vader, we only use this facility for carbon freezing. You put him in there, it might kill him!
I do not want the Emperor's prize damaged. We will test it... on Captain Solo.
All too easy.
Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing. If the Millennium Falcon went into light-speed, it'll be on the other side of the galaxy by now.
Alert all commands. Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory.
Yes, my Lord. We'll find them.
Don't fail me again, Admiral.
You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hutt after I have Skywalker.
He's no good to me dead.
He will not be permanently damaged.
Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee?
They must never again leave this city.
That was never a condition of our agreement, nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter!
Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly?
No.
Good, it would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison here.
This deal is getting worse all the time!
What is it, General?
My Lord, the fleet has moved out of lightspeed. Com Scan has detected an energy field protecting an area of the sixth planet of the Hoth System. The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment.
The Rebels are alerted to our presence. Admiral Ozzel came out of lightspeed too close to the system.
He... he felt surprise was wiser...
He is as clumsy as he is stupid! General... prepare your troops for a surface attack.
Yes, my Lord.
Your destiny lies with me Skywalker. Obi-Wan knew this to be true.
No...
Lord Vader, we only use this facility for carbon freezing. If you put him in there it might kill him.
I do not want the Emperor's prize damaged. We will test it on Captain Solo.
Alert my Star Destroyer to prepare for my arrival.
Yes, Admiral, what is it?
The Emperor commands you make contact with him.
Move the ship out of the asteroid field so that we can send a clear transmission.
Alert my Star Destroyer to prepare for my arrival.
Bring my shuttle.
They were damaged, Lord Vader, the last time they appeared in any of our scopes. Considering the amount of damage we've sustained, they must be destroyed.
No, Captain. They're alive. I want every ship available to sweep the asteroid field until they are found.
Lord Vader.
Yes, Admiral, what is it?
The Emperor commands you to make contact with him.
Move the ship out of the asteroid field so we can send a clear transmission.
Yes, master.
What is thy bidding, my master?
There is a great disturbance in the Force.
I have felt it.
We have a new enemy. Luke Skywalker.
Yes, my master.
He could destroy us.
He's just a boy. Obi-Wan can no longer help him.
The Force is strong with him. The son of Skywalker cannot become a Jedi.
If he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally.
Yes... Yes. He would be a great ascent. Can it be done?
He will join us, or die, my master.
There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you.
Luke, you do not yet realize your importance. You have only begun to discover your power. Join me, and I will complete your training. With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy.
I'll never join you!
If you only knew the power of the Dark Side. Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father.
He told me enough! He told me *you* killed him!
No. *I* am your father.
No. No. That's not true. That's impossible!
Search your feelings, you *know* it to be true!
No! No!"
Inigo Montoya,"AW, BF, BP","Master Swordsman, Revenge, Tranquil Fury","Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
Give us the gate key.
I have no gate key.
Fezzik, tear his arms off.
Oh, you mean *this* gate key.
Who are you?
No one of consequence.
I must know...
Get used to disappointment.
'kay.
HE DIDN'T FALL? INCONCEIVABLE.
You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.
That Vizzini, he can *fuss*.
Fuss, fuss... I think he like to scream at *us*.
Probably he means no *harm*.
He's really very short on *charm*.
You have a great gift for rhyme.
Yes, yes, some of the time.
Enough of that.
Fezzik, are there rocks ahead?
If there are, we all be dead.
No more rhymes now, I mean it.
Anybody want a peanut?
DYEEAAHHHHHH!
But, I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
That's VERY comforting, but I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
No good. I've known too many Spaniards.
Isn't there any way you trust me?
Nothing comes to mind.
I swear on the soul of my father, Domingo Montoya, you will reach the top alive.
Throw me the rope.
Is very strange. I have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over, I don't know what to do with the rest of my life.
Have you ever considered piracy? You'd make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts.
You are wonderful.
Thank you; I've worked hard to become so.
I admit it, you are better than I am.
Then why are you smiling?
Because I know something you don't know.
And what is that?
I am not left-handed.
You are amazing.
I ought to be, after 20 years.
Oh, there's something I ought to tell you.
Tell me.
I'm not left-handed either.
I donna suppose you could speed things up?
If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope or a tree branch or find something useful to do.
I could do that. I have some rope up here, but I do not think you would accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you.
That does put a damper on our relationship.
I do not mean to pry, but you don't by any chance happen to have six fingers on your right hand?
Do you always begin conversations this way?
Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
Hello! My name is Inigo Montoya! You killed my father! Prepare to die!
Stop saying that!
HELLO! MY NAME IS INIGO MONTOYA! YOU KILLED MY FATHER! PREPARE TO DIE!
Offer me money.
Yes!
Power, too, promise me that.
All that I have and more. Please...
Offer me anything I ask for.
Anything you want...
I want my father back, you son of a bitch!
Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
Stop saying that!
You've done nothing but study swordplay?
More pursue than study lately. You see, I cannot find him... it's been twenty years now and I'm starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.
Well I certainly hope you find him someday.
You are ready then?
Whether I am or not, you've been more than fair.
You seem a decent fellow... I hate to kill you.
You seem a decent fellow... I hate to die.
Begin.
He probably owes you money huh? I'll ask him.
He's dead. He can't talk.
Whoo-hoo-hoo, look who knows so much. It just so happens that your friend here is only MOSTLY dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Mostly dead is slightly alive. With all dead, well, with all dead there's usually only one thing you can do.
What's that?
Go through his clothes and look for loose change.
You got any money?
Sixty-five.
I've never worked for so little. Except once, and that was a very noble cause.
This is noble, sir. His wife is... crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation.
Are you a rotten liar!
I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.
Your first story was better.
You are using Bonetti's Defense against me, ah?
I thought it fitting considering the rocky terrain.
Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro?
Naturally, but I find that Thibault cancels out Capo Ferro. Don't you?
Unless the enemy has studied his Agrippa... which I have!
Who are you? Are we enemies? Why am I on this wall? Where is Buttercup?
Let me explain.
No, there is too much. Let me sum up. Buttercup is marry Humperdinck in little less than half an hour. So all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the princess, make our escape... after I kill Count Rugen.
That doesn't leave much time for dilly-dallying.
You just wiggled your finger. That's wonderful.
I've always been a quick healer. What are our liabilities?
There is but one working castle gate, and... and it is guarded by 60 men.
And our assets?
Your brains, Fezzik's strength, my steel.
Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the king all those years?
The King's stinking son fired me, and thank you so much for bringing up such a painful subject. While you're at it, why don't you give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it? We're closed.
Do you hear that, Fezzik? That is the sound of ultimate suffering. My heart made that sound when Rugen slaughtered my father. The man in black makes it now.
The man in black?
His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has the cause for ultimate suffering?
You never said anything about killing anyone.
I've hired you to help me start a war. It's an prestigious line of work, with a long and glorious tradition.
I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
Am I going MAD, or did the word ""think"" escape your lips? You were not hired for your brains, you hippopotamic land mass.
I agree with Fezzik.
Oh, the sot has spoken. What happens to her is not truly your concern. I will kill her. And remember this, never forget this: when I found you, you were so slobbering drunk, you couldn't buy brandy!
And YOU: friendless, brainless, helpless, hopeless! Do you want me to send you back to where you were? Unemployed, in Greenland?
Inigo?
What?
I hope we win.
My father was slaughtered by a six-fingered man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. When the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He slaved a year before it was done.
I've never seen its equal.
The six-fingered man returned and demanded it, but at one tenth his promised price. My father refused. Without a word, the six-fingered man slashed him through the heart. I loved my father. So naturally, I challenged his murderer to a duel. I failed. The six-fingered man left me alive, but he gave me these.
How old were you?
I was eleven years old. And when I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the six-fingered man and say, ""Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.""
You know, Fezzik, you finally did something right.
Don't worry, I won't let it go to my head.
But this is Buttercup's true love - If you heal him, he will stop Humperdinck's wedding.
Wait. Wait. I make him better, Humperdinck suffers?
Humiliations galore!
HA-HA-HA!
*That* is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, I'm on the job.
Jump in after her!
I don't swim
I only dog paddle.
AGGHH!
You are sure nobody's followed us?
As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done, and no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
No reason. It's only... I just happened to look behind us and something is there.
What? Probably some local fisherman, out for a pleasure cruise, at night... in... eel-infested waters...
Excuse me... Pardon me, please, it's important... Fezzik, please?
EVERYBODY MOVE!
Thank you.
Where is the Man in Black?
Fezzik, jog his memory.
Sorry, Inigo. I didn't mean to jog him so hard.
Oh, what I wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.
There, we cannot help you.
Will this do?
Where did you get that?
At Miracle Max's. It fits so nice, he said I could keep it.
I mean, if we only had a wheelbarrow, that would be something.
Where we did we put that wheelbarrow the albino had?
Over the albino, I think.
Well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place?
Hello there. Slow going?
Look, I don't mean to be rude but this is not as easy as it looks, so I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.
Sorry.
Thank you.
I am waiting for you, Vizzini! You told me to go back to the beginning... so I have.
This is where I am, this is where I'll stay. I will not be moved!
He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.
I am waiting for Vizzini.
You surely are a meanie.
Hello.
It's you.
True!
Thank you.
We'll wait until you are ready.
Again, thank you.
There will be blood tonight!
You truly love each other? Then you might have been truly happy! No couple in a century has that chance, no matter what the storybooks say. And so I think no man in a century will suffer as greatly as you will
Not to Fifty!

Fezzik, do you hear that? That is the sound of ultimate suffering. My heart made that sound when Count Rugen killed my father. The Man in Black makes it now.
The Man in Black?
His true love is marry Prince Humperdinck tonight, so who else has cause for ultimate suffering?
That's a miracle pill?
The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go in swimming after, for at least, what?
We'll head straight for the Guilder frontier. You catch up with us there. If he falls, fine. If not, the sword.
I'm going to duel him left-handed.
You know what a hurry we're in!
Well, is only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right... over too quickly.
Oh, have it your way.
Where is this Count Rugen now, so I may kill him?
He's in the castle with the prince. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
How may do you think you could handle?
I don't think more than ten.
I do not budge; keep your ""ho there"".
Let's go.
Where?
Find the man in black obviously.
But don't you know where he is.
Don't bother me with trifles. After 20 years, at last my father's soul will be at peace. There will be blood tonight!
How long do we have to wait, before we know the miracle works?
You're guess is as good as mine.
I'll beat you both apart! I'll take you both together!
I guess not very long.
Kill me quickly.
I would sooner destroy a stained glass window than an artist like yourself. However, since I can't have you follow me either...
Please understand I hold you in the highest respect.
Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
Give us the gate key.
I have no gate key.
Fezzik, tear his arms off.
Oh, you mean *this* gate key.
Who are you?
No one of consequence.
I must know...
Get used to disappointment.
'kay.
HE DIDN'T FALL? INCONCEIVABLE.
You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.
That Vizzini, he can *fuss*.
Fuss, fuss... I think he like to scream at *us*.
Probably he means no *harm*.
He's really very short on *charm*.
You have a great gift for rhyme.
Yes, yes, some of the time.
Enough of that.
Fezzik, are there rocks ahead?
If there are, we all be dead.
No more rhymes now, I mean it.
Anybody want a peanut?
DYEEAAHHHHHH!
But, I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
That's VERY comforting, but I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
No good. I've known too many Spaniards.
Isn't there any way you trust me?
Nothing comes to mind.
I swear on the soul of my father, Domingo Montoya, you will reach the top alive.
Throw me the rope.
Is very strange. I have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over, I don't know what to do with the rest of my life.

No reason. It's only... I just happened to look behind us and something is there.
What? Probably some local fisherman, out for a pleasure cruise, at night... in... eel-infested waters...
Excuse me... Pardon me, please, it's important... Fezzik, please?
EVERYBODY MOVE!
Thank you.
Where is the Man in Black?
Fezzik, jog his memory.
Sorry, Inigo. I didn't mean to jog him so hard.
Oh, what I wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.
There, we cannot help you.
Will this do?
Where did you get that?
At Miracle Max's. It fits so nice, he said I could keep it.
I mean, if we only had a wheelbarrow, that would be something.
Where we did we put that wheelbarrow the albino had?
Over the albino, I think.
Well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place?
Hello there. Slow going?
Look, I don't mean to be rude but this is not as easy as it looks, so I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.
Sorry.
Thank you.
I am waiting for you, Vizzini! You told me to go back to the beginning... so I have.
This is where I am, this is where I'll stay. I will not be moved!
He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.
I am waiting for Vizzini.
You surely are a meanie.
Hello.
It's you.
True!
Thank you.
We'll wait until you are ready.
Again, thank you.
There will be blood tonight!
You truly love each other? Then you might have been truly happy! No couple in a century has that chance, no matter what the storybooks say. And so I think no man in a century will suffer as greatly as you will
Not to Fifty!

Fezzik, do you hear that? That is the sound of ultimate suffering. My heart made that sound when Count Rugen killed my father. The Man in Black makes it now.
The Man in Black?
His true love is marry Prince Humperdinck tonight, so who else has cause for ultimate suffering?
That's a miracle pill?
The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go in swimming after, for at least, what?
We'll head straight for the Guilder frontier. You catch up with us there. If he falls, fine. If not, the sword.
I'm going to duel him left-handed.
You know what a hurry we're in!
Well, is only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right... over too quickly.
Oh, have it your way.
Where is this Count Rugen now, so I may kill him?
He's in the castle with the prince. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
How may do you think you could handle?
I don't think more than ten.
I do not budge; keep your ""ho there"".
Let's go.
Where?
Find the man in black obviously.
But don't you know where he is.
Don't bother me with trifles. After 20 years, at last my father's soul will be at peace. There will be blood tonight!
How long do we have to wait, before we know the miracle works?
You're guess is as good as mine.
I'll beat you both apart! I'll take you both together!
I guess not very long.
Kill me quickly.
I would sooner destroy a stained glass window than an artist like yourself. However, since I can't have you follow me either...
Please understand I hold you in the highest respect."

Archibald Cunningham,AW,Master Swordsman,"Think of yourself a scabbard, Mistress McGregor, and I the sword. And a fine fit you were, too.
I will think on you dead, until my husband makes you so. And then I will think on you no more.
What did you do with that bag of guts Killearn? Vex me not, McGregor, or I shall have you dragged a while. And I am a man of my word.
You're a thief, a murderer and a violator of women.
Aah... I had hoped you'd come to me long since on that score.
If I had known earlier you would have been dead sooner.
I will tell you something, to take with you. Your wife was far sweeter forced than many are willing. And truth put to it, I think not all of her objected...
Love is a dung hill, Betty, and I am but a cock that climbs upon it to crow.
So, Mr. Cunningham, what are these principle sins that distress your mother? Dice? Drink? Or are you a buggerer of boys?
It is years, Your Grace, since I buggered a boy... And in my own defense, I must add, I thought him a girl at the moment of entry.
Do you hear that, Will? Young Cunningham here was unable to tell arse from quim. What say you to that?
I've heard that many Englishmen have that same difficulty.
You are here on a matter of honor. I am here to see that you settle it honorably. There will be no back-stabbing, you will not throw your blades, nor will you use weapons other than those agreed. If quarter should be asked...
No quarter will be asked.
Or given.
He's a fair hand with a cleaver, it must be said.
Oh, you do not think much of our highland weapons?
If I had to slaughter an ox, your grace, a Claymore would be my first choice.
You'd best use a musket. Save the beast a slow dying.
I would not need a musket for you, Guthrie.
I have had a message from His Grace the Duke of Argyll. It seems our MacGregor is holed up with him. He offers us a match: you and the Highlander.
Bring him on.
You speak, Archibald! One must never underestimate the healing power of hatred.
You don't ask a whore. You make her.
I want MacGregor!"
Madmartigan,AW,Master Swordsman,"Did I really... Did I really say those things, last night, in your tent?
You said you loved me.
I don't remember that.
You lied to me.
No, I... I just wasn't myself last night.
I suppose my power enchanted you and you were helpless against it.
Sort of.
Then what?
It... went away.
Went away? ""I dwell in darkness without you"" and it *went away*?
What are you doing?
I found some blackroot. She loves it.
Blackroot? I'm the father of two children, and you never, ever give a baby blackroot.
Well my mother raised us on it. It's good for you! It put's hair on your chest, right Sticks?
Her name is not Sticks! She's Elora Danan, the future empress of Tir Asleen and the last thing she's gonna want is a hairy chest!
See this acorn? I'll throw it at you and turn you to stone!
Ooh, I'm really scared. No! Don't! There's a- a peck here with an acorn pointed at me!
What are you looking at?
Your leg. I'd like to break it.
What the hell happened up there?
You started spouting poetry. ""I love you Sorsha! I worship you Sorsha!"" You almost got us killed!
""I love you Sorsha?"" I don't love her, she kicked me in the face! I hate her... Don't I?
Wanna breed?
Tempting... but no.
We need your help!
My help? Why would you need my help? You're a *sorcerer*.
You're a great warrior! And a swordsman!... And you're ten times bigger than I am, stupid!
Don't call me a peck!
Oh, I'm sorry! Peck! Peck! Peck, peck, peck, peck, peck, peck, peck!
You're... beautiful.
And you're very strong.
Thank you...
You're no woman!
Now, honey...
Not a woman?
Easy!
Gentlemen...
*Not a woman?*
...meet Llug.
I love you, Sorsha!
Stop saying that!
Fine, good! Then we go that way, to the lake!
*That* way.
You are drunk! And when you are drunk, you forget that I am in charge!
You are in charge. Fine, then which way do we go?
, :
THAT WAY!
, :
THAT WAY!
Oh, NO! That's the way I'm going! All right, all right, you can follow me as far as the lake. But that's it!
You're not going south, are you?
What are you going to look like if this works?
Don't interrupt.
Sorry.
I'm a young beautiful woman.
Concentrate, Willow!
Here are her changing rags and her milk bladder.
Any milk in there?
It's for *her*!
I wouldn't steal from a *baby*! You worry too much, Peck.
It's Willow!
That's magic? It smells terrible.
It's the life spark. It forms...
Well, it stinks! This whole thing stinks!
I guess I am gonna die here. Who cares?
Here.
Thanks, friend.
What's that?
I'd say two or three hundred horses, five or six wagons... and about a thousand fools.
Let me out of here, Airk. Give me a sword, I'll win this war for you.
I still serve Galadorn, remember? You serve no one. Just sit in your coffin and rot.
I'll be around long after you're dead! When I get out of here, I'm gonna cut your head off and stick it on a pig pole!
Well, looks like I got you here.
You? What did you do?
All you did was hang around and eat our eggs.
We found one of your babies in our village. Will you please take care of her?
We're going into battle, little ones. Find a woman to take care of her.
He thought you *were* a woman, Airk!
Burglekutt, you're troll dung!
Don't let him talk to you that way, Burglekutt!
Why did I *listen* to you, Peck? ""Everything will be all right once we get to Tir Asleen"". Well, the only army around here is the one that will ride across this valley and wipe us out!
But Cherlindrea said we'd be safe here!
Safe? Look at these people! This place is cursed, Peck. It's falling apart. Open your eyes. And it...
Trolls!
I found a boat. We're all set.
Good. Take these two lizards out and drown them.
Lizards? Who you calling lizards? Grrr! Grrr! Your mother was a lizard!
Ha ha ha! Madmartigan. What'd you do this time?
Nothing you wouldn't have done in my place.
I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.
Well, at least I'm not down there herding sheep.
What's that?
Smells like a battle.
I suppose you're a warrior.
I am the greatest swordsman that ever lived. Say, um, can I have some of that water?
Burglekutt, let me out of here. I'll take care of the baby, I swear. Just let me out of here... Please. Vohnkar, let me borrow that spear just for a minute. Well... Well at least give me some water. Burglekutt, don't leave me alone here with these two! UHH! Well that was really stupid, Peck.
Get your hair out of my face or I'll chop it off.
Come on, Madmartigan. Let's get Elora Dannan out of here.
Yeah. It'll be fun!
Madmartigan, you never, ever drive that fast with an infant!
I just saved that infant's life!
She is kinda cute... When she's quiet.
She's really a princess.
Really? And you're a great sorcerer... And I'm the king of Cashmir. Go to sleep, Willow.
Hey, Mumbo. Jumbo. I am hungry. Go get me some eggs or something.
We are not afraid of you!
NOW!
Let me do that. Get away, rodents!
Take your hand off that! You leave that alone you stupid, fat Daikini!"

Aragorn,AW,Master Swordsman,"Hold your ground, hold your ground! Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers! I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me. A day may come when the courage of men fails, when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship, but it is not this day. An hour of wolves and shattered shields, when the age of men comes crashing down! But it is not this day! This day we fight! By all that you hold dear on this good Earth, I bid you *stand, Men of the West!*
My friends. You bow to no one.
I summon you to fulfill your oath.
None but the king of Gondor may command me.
That blade was broken!
It has been remade.
Fight for us... and regain your honor.
Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth! Let justice be done upon him!
My master, Sauron the Great, bids thee welcome. Is there any in this rout with authority to treat with me?
We do not come to treat with Sauron, faithless and accursed. Tell your master this: the armies of Mordor must disband. He is to depart these lands, never to return.
Ahh, old Greybeard. I have a token I was bidden to show thee.
Frodo...
Silence.
No!
Silence!
The halfling was dear to thee, I see. Know that he suffered greatly at the hands of his host. Who would've thought one so small could endure so much pain? And he did, Gandalf, he did.
And who is this? Isildur's heir? It takes more to make a King that a broken Elvish blade...
I guess that concludes negotiations.
I do not believe it! I will not!
You're outnumbered, Aragorn. You need more men.
There are none.
There are those who dwell in the mountain.
Murderers. Traitors. You would call upon them to fight? They believe in nothing. They answer to no one.
They will answer to the king of Gondor.
Anduril, Flame of the West, forged from the shards of Narsil.
Sauron will not have forgotten the sword of Elendil. The blade that was broken shall return to Minas Tirith.
The man who can wield the power of this sword can summon to him an army more deadly than any that walks this earth. Put aside the Ranger. Become who you were born to be. Take the Dimholt Road.
I give hope to men.
I keep none for myself.
He's suffered a defeat, yes, but... behind the walls of Mordor, our enemy is regrouping.
Let him stay there. *Let him rot!* Why should we care?
Because ten-thousand Orcs now stand between Frodo and Mount Doom. I've sent him to his death.
No. There is still hope for Frodo. He needs time... and safe passage across the plains of Gorgoroth. We can give him that.
How?
Draw out Sauron's armies. Empty his lands. Then we gather our full strength and march on the Black Gate.
We cannot achieve victory through strength of arms.
Not for ourselves. But we can give Frodo his chance if we keep Sauron's Eye fixed upon us. Keep him blind to all else that moves.
A diversion.
Certainty of death, *small* chance of success... What are we waiting for?
Sauron will suspect a trap. He will not take the bait.
No, I think he will.
The Beacons of Minas Tirith! The Beacons are lit! Gondor calls for aid.
And Rohan will answer. Muster the Rohirrim. Assemble the army at Dunharrow. As many men as can be found. You have two days. On the third, we ride for Gondor... and war.
For Frodo.
The dead do not suffer the living to pass.
You will suffer me.
Where do you think you're going?
Not this time, Gimli. This time you must stay.
Have you learned nothing of the stubbornness of Dwarves?
You may as well accept it. We're going with you, laddy.
I have wished you joy since first I saw you.
You may go no further! You will not enter Gondor.
Who are you to deny us passage?
Legolas, fire a warning shot past the bosun's ear.
Mind your aim!
Oh! That's it, right! We warned you! Prepare to be boarded!
Boarded! By you and whose army?
*This* army.
Why are you doing this? The war lies to the East. You cannot leave on the eve of battle.
You cannot abandon the men.
Eowyn...
We need you here.
Why have you come?
Do you not know?
It is but a shadow and a thought that you love. I cannot give you what you seek.
We have time. Every day Frodo moves closer to Mordor.
Do we know that?
What does your heart tell you?
That Frodo is alive. Yes. Yes, he's alive.
I do not fear death.
This day does not belong to one man but to all. Let us together rebuild this world that we may share in the days of peace.
Behold! The sword of Elendil!
I take my leave.
My Lord Elrond.
I come on behalf of one whom I love. Arwen is dying. She will not long survive the evil that now spreads from Mordor. The light of the Evenstar is failing. As Sauron's power grows, her strength wanes. Arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the Ring. The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn. The end has come.
It will not be our end but his.
Long have you hunted me, long have I eluded you. No more. Behold! The Sword of Elendil!
For Frodo!
Frodo has passed beyond my sight. The darkness is deepening.
If Sauron had the Ring, we would know it.
It's only a matter of time.
I will go.
No.
They must be warned.
They will be.
Six thousand spears. Less than half of what I'd hoped for.
Six thousand will not be enough to break the lines of Mordor.
More will come.
Every hour lost hastens Gondor's defeat. We have 'til dawn, then we must ride.
What say you? What say you? I am Isildur's heir. Fight for me. And I will hold your oaths fulfilled. What say you?"
Blade,AW,Master Swordsman,"Some motherfuckers are always trying to ice-skate uphill.
You better wake up. The world you live in is just a sugar-coated topping! There is another world beneath it: the real world. And if you wanna survive it, you better learn to PULL THE TRIGGER!
Mother fucker! Are you out of your damn mind?
There are worse things out tonight than vampires.
Like what?
Like me.
OK, Vampire Anatomy 101, crosses and holy water don't do dick so forget what you've seen in the movies. You use a wooden stake, silver or sunlight to kill them. You know how to use one of these?
No, but I'll damn sure learn quick.
Safety's off, round's already chambered. Silver hollow-point bullets filled with garlic. You aim for the head or the heart. Anything else, its your ass.
You have a lot of love for him, don't you?
We have a good arrangement. He makes the weapons. I use them.
Still heavy.
But, you're so big.
La Magra is coming! The Spirits of the Twelve will awaken the Blood God!
And there is nothing you can do about it, Daywalker!
Is that so?
Well, that's what Frost says.
You give Frost a message from me. You tell him it's open season on all suckheads.
Oh, great. Now you're robbing him. You gonna rob me, too?
How do you think that we fund this organization, huh? We're not exactly the March of Dimes.
You're one of them, aren't you?
No, I'm something else.
Frost is trying to trigger a fuckin' vampire apocalypse. There's some kind of vampire God he's trying to resurrect.
La Magra.
You're the key. He needs your blood. The blood of the day walker. You're the chosen one.
How you doing, chief?
Easy.
Wouldn't want our little friend here to wind up in the back of a milk carton now, would we? It's nice to finally meet you, man. Had my eye on you for years. I know all about you. Your serum, Whistler. Everything.
Sunblock.
Hey, it's a start, right? The goal, of course, is to be like you - the Daywalker! You got the best of both worlds, don't you? All our strengths... none of our weaknesses.
Well, maybe I don't see it that way.
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again? C'mon... spare me the Uncle Tom routine, okay? You can't keep denying what you are, man. You think the humans will ever accept a half-breed like you? They can't. They're afraid of you. And they should be. You're an animal, you're a fuckin' maniac! Look at 'em. They're cattle; pieces of meat. What difference does it make how their world ends? Plague... war... famine. Morality doesn't even enter into it. We're just a function of natural selection, man. The new race.
Looks like your mascara's running.
I'm offering you a truce. I want you with us.
What... do you think I'm stupid?
""The Spirits of the Twelve will awaken La Magra.""
You're familiar with the Blood God.
Frost... you're nothing to me but another dead vampire.
You're an idiot, you know that? I came down here offering you an easy way out and you spit it right back in my fuckin' face!
Careful!
What do I care? They're nothing but cattle... just like you said.
If you wanna take the hard road, be my guest, pal. But I promise you by the time this is over, you're gonna wish they never cut you from your mother's...
Is that you? He's here! He's here!
This must be Pearl. The record keeper.
Wait a minute! I'm coming with you.
You're useless.
Oh, lookie here.
Silver. Nice craftsman ship, huh? Probably cost you a pretty penny. Now this here is a man who takes his job just a little too seriously, don't you think? Come to think of it, Blade, I owe you one.
Actually, if you want to get technical, Blade...
I owe you two.
Oh, what's so funny, bright eyes?
I'm expecting company.
Catch you fuckers at a bad time?
Eric, I'm you mother. You wouldn't hurt your mother would you? Come here.
I must release you.
Aaaaaahhhhhhhhh!
FFFRRROOOOOOSSST!
Kill him.
I need to get back to the lab, if I'm going to cure you.
It's not over. You keep your cure. There's still a war going on, and I have a job to do. You wanna help, make me a better serum.
We're gonna play a little game of twenty questions. Depending on how you answer, you may walk out of here with a tan?
What's *that*?
Oh, that? Oh, it's nothing, it's routine research, heh, heh... Actually, it's a video game.
That musta hurt.
It's a fragment! A piece of the prophecy!
What prophecy?
Oh, I'm not really sure. There's so many out...
You see the valets over there? They're vampires. So's the doorman... and the whore on the corner.
How can you tell?
By the way they move. The way they smell.
Ugh! What is this? Garlic?
Yeah, well he said it would work against vampires.
Vampires? Who said I was a vampire?
Nobody.
Go fuck yourself!
Fuck me? No, you fuck this!
I hear you been looking for me. I'm flattered.
It'll pass.
I promise you, you'll be dead by dawn.
Catch you at a bad time... comrade?
Quinn. I'm gettin' a little tired of choppin' you up. Thought I might try fire for a change.
You used me as bait?
Get over it.
You been listening in the whole time?
Keeping radio contact.
Think I'd let him run loose without a chaperon?
Kill him.
Wait. I oh you man. I got two new hands, and I don't know which one to kill you with.
Rawr.
FFFRRROOOOOOSSST!
Kill him.
So, am I a prisoner here?
Not at all. We just had to take certain precautions before we let you go. You got to understand, they're everwhere. Vampires. A Hominus Nocturna. We hunt them you see, moving from one city to the next, tracking their migrations. They're hard to kill. They tend to regenerate.
And I'm supposed to believe all this?
Well, you already met Mr. Crispy at the hospital. What do you think?
Remember what we told you. You keep your eyes open. They're everywhere.
Isn't this just a little high-tech?
They've got their claws into everything - politics, finance, real estate. They already own half of downtown.
I'm not human.
You look human to me.
Humans don't drink blood.
That was a long time abo. Maybe you should let that go?
I have spent my whole life lookin' for that thing that killed my mother, and made me what I am. And every time I take one of those monsters out, I get a little piece of that life back. So don't you tell me about forgetting."
He-Man,AW,Master Swordsman,"I have the power!
YOU! You will no longer stand between me and my destiny!
But I will! I told you that it's always between us!
I ache to smash you out of existence! To drive your cursed face from my memories forever!
Enough talk!
YES! Let this be our final battle!
Did you have any luck?
Not as much as you, apparently.
Your wonderous Sorceress will die!
You dare threaten her life?
I dare anything! I am Skeletor! Throw down your weapons and pledge yourselves to me! Or you will join her!
It's not her you want, it's me. It's always been between us.
Silence!
When we find the Key, Gwildor will set the coordinates for Grayskull. We'll use the element of surprise...
Oh, sure! We'll drop right into the throne room, fight off two or three thousand of Skeletor's crack troops, break into the force field and free the Sorceress.
Right!
How do you feel?
I'm feeling a little hungry.
Witness this moment, He-Man! This moment where the powers of Greyskull will become mine for eternity! Our life-long battle in ending at last in the only way it could. When the Great Eye opens. The people of Eternia will see you kneel before me, just before you die!
I'll never kneel to you!
Yes, you will! Yes, you will! Or I shall wreak unforgettable harm upon you!
You promised not to hurt them!
I lied! Farewell, He-Man!
Everything comes to he who waits. And I have waited so very long for this moment.
Let her go.
I don't think so. No. While she remains inprisoned within this field, her powers increase my own. And when the moon reaches its zenith, the Great Eye will open and all the powers of Grayskull will be bestowed upon me. Your wondrous Sorceress will die!
You dare threaten her life?
I dare anything! I am Skeletor. Throw down your weapons and pledge yourselves to me or you will join her.
It's not her you want. It's me. It's always been between us.
Silence!
It's the locksmith. The little vermin has another key!
What? No. Kill him!"
Dr. Loveless,AJ,Gadgeteer Genius,"Mister West! How nice of you to join us tonight and add COLOR to these monochromatic proceedings!
Well when a fella comes back from the dead, I find that an occasion to STAND UP and be counted!
Miss East informs me that you were expectin' to see General McGrath here. Well, I knew him years ago, but I haven't seen him in a COON's age!
Well, I can see where it'd be difficult for a man of your stature to keep in touch with even HALF the people you know.
Well, perhaps the lovely Miss East will keep you from bein' a SLAVE to your disappointment!
Well, you know beautiful women; they encourage you one minute, and CUT THE LEGS OUT from under you the next!
I only have one request: that you aim for my heart, my heart which has loved this country so much.
Shoot him in the head.
Damn.
You sawed-off sadistic bastard! You've betrayed us!
My dear General, having donated half of my physical being to create a weapon capable of doing this, how did you and General Lee repay my loyalty? You surrendered at Appomattox! So who betrayed whom?
We may not have a woodshed on board, but that boy is gonna get a whuppin' anyway!
Why y'all look like you've seen a ghost? It's me, dear friends - alive and kicking! Well, alive, anyway. We may have lost the war, but heaven knows we haven't lost our sense of humor! No, not even when we've lost a lung, a spleen, a bladder, two legs, thirty-five feet of small intestine, and our ability to reproduce - all in the name of the South! - do we EVER LOSE OUR SENSE OF HUMOR!
Rita, my dear. Not that I'm ungrateful to providence for bringing you back, but I have to confess - I'm just a little bit curious as to how you managed to wind up with them.
Well, they seemed so sure that they could find you, I thought if I stayed with them, they'd bring me back to all my friends.
Not to give you a big head, but, I kind of missed you.
Well, isn't that a coincidence? Cos, I kinda miss me too!
Gentlemen, I am truly impressed by your effort and ingenuity. Why not swear an oath of loyalty to me, and forgo your executions?
Actually, I was thinking I'd stuff your little half-an-ass into one of these cannons and fertilize the landscape with ya.
The wrongs will be righted! The past made present! The United - divided!
Well, I think that concludes this night's festivities. Ladies, feed him to the crabs.
Gentlemen, since the beginning of written history a nation's power has been measured by the size of its standing army. Tonight that chapter will be closed. The traditional army, to say nothing of the United States, will become extinct, laid low by a *cripple*-!
-as the general so amusingly implied, and mechanology. But my friends, that tank is just a little hors d'oeuvre compared to what the country's greatest scientists are cooking up for me next. So, if I have piqued your interest, bring one thousand kilograms of your country's gold to Spider Canyon in ten days time. And now if you'll excuse me, I have a tank to catch.
Mr. President, for the last time, sign the surrender, or I will decimate this town!
You've had my answer.
Well, I understand your position, sir, but I urge you to reconsider, in light of the following!
I have them square in my sights, Sire!
As do I, Munitia! As do I!
Well now isn't this a coincidence? I'm out for a little morning ride and right in the middle of nowhere I bump into General Ulysses S. Grant himself!
For four long years I've been chasing the animal responsible for the massacre at New Liberty. I hear tell that's you.
I am not an animal! I am a visionary, I am a genius, and now I am *angry*! And after I kill you, I swear I'm going to boil you down for axle grease!"
Artemus Gordon,AJ,Gadgeteer Genius,"Gordon, what's your plan for getting this thing off my neck?
Excuse me?
Well, that's what you're here for, right? You're the master of this mechanical stuff.
Oh ho ho, I see. *Now* I'm the ""master of this mechanical stuff."" As opposed to five minutes ago, when I was calmly and coolly trying to find a solution to this very problem. But then something happened. Someone, who will remain nameless...
JIM WEST!
...decided to jump over the wire, thereby providing us with that exhilarating romp through the cornfield, and that death-defying leap into the abysmal muck! And here we stand, with that demented maniac hurtling towards our President, with our one and only means of transportation, with Rita as his prisoner, armed with God-knows-what machinery of mass destruction, with the simple intention of overthrowing our government and taking over the country!
Gordon, I think you need to calm down.
I can't be calm! Oh, no, no, no, no, I'm the ""Master of the Mechanical Stuff""! And I have to help you! You, the master of the STUPID STUFF! You want to get your collar off? I'll get it off!
I don't have a gun, otherwise I'd shoot it off!
Here, here's something! In the true Jim West style, I'll just bash it with a rock!
Gordon, you don't want to do that...
Oh, but I do!
I only have one request: that you aim for my heart, my heart which has loved this country so much.
Shoot him in the head.
Damn.
She's a breath of fresh ass.
Pardon me?
What?
You said ""ass.""
No, I didn't. I said, ""It's nice having her on board, she's a breast of fresh air.""
Let's just get some shut ass.
Loveless has kidnapped metallurgists, so whatever he's building is going to have armor. He's kidnapped chemists, so it'll have explosives. And you've said that Rita's father is the biggest expert on hydraulics in the world, so it's going to move. What could he be building that will make the president surrender the U.S. Goverment?
A bedside heater.
What?
Rita. She could use a bedside heater. It gets rather cold back there.
Oh, look. My auxiliary tool kit, I forgot all about it. It must have fallen out of my pocket.
Your pocket? Why wasn't it on some spring-loaded contraption that shoots out your ass?
That's the first place Loveless would have looked.
Jim?
What now, Artie?
Mind if I ask you a question?
Actually, I do, Artie.
He's so impetuous.
Yes, he's an idiot.
Let me tell you something about your beloved art of disguise, Gordon. That night at Fat Can's, it wasn't a difficult task to tell that you weren't a woman.
I was propositioned by three men!
You know, you could put a gun on that.
Then where would I keep my pencil?
I thought I'd go as a government agent who's going to shoot and kill General Bloodbath McGrath.
An armed Negro cowboy costume in a room full of white, Southern, former slave-owners. You'll win first prize.
The collars around our necks! They contain powerful magnets! As long as we can outrun the blades, we'll be fine!
Gordon! How long does it take for a magnet to lose its power?
About four hundred years!
Damn!
Gordon, when you tell this story to your grandkids, you be sure to leave this part out.
Don't worry.
We have the element of surprise. What does Loveless have?
He has his own city.
He has an 80-foot tarantula.
I was just coming to that.
What did you do?
I didn't do shit!
Yes, you did! You've somehow reversed the polarity of your magnet!
Hey! I-did-not-do-shit!
Although he was considered insane by his peers, Bernoulli's theory states that the air flowing over a bird's wing is at a lower pressure than the air flowing under the wing. That's called ""lift,"" and that is what we're now going to... attempt. Of course, it's only a theory, it's never been tested...
Stop talking.
Sorry.
I've been trying to place myself in Loveless' shoes.
Good luck with that one.
What could this demented maniac with no reproductive organs, want with Rita?
Which is not to say Rita doesn't possess a beauty worthy of a Shakespeare sonnet or a Botticelli painting. My god, the curvature of her buttocks and the swell of that magnificent bosom. So full, so sumptous, so...
... what were all those foreign ministers doing at Loveless' party? This is what really puzzles me, did you have any idea there were so many, so foreign, so...
How long has she been here?
Somewhere around Botticelli's buttocks.
I am profoundly sorry.
Gentlemen, you'll be happy to know that I'm starting a new agency, whose sole purpose is the protection of the President. Welcome to the Secret Service, Agents Number One, and Number Two.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Sir, if you don't mind my asking, which of us is Number One and which is Number Two?
I don't think that really matters, Gordon, do you?
Not if you don't, sir.
Hold on. Avanti!
Avanti! Avanti!
Why isn't this thing avanti-ing?
We're not getting enough lift! We need more speed!
Artie, that's a cliff!
Yes, I know!
That means the ground is gonna end!
Yes, I know!
Gordon... Gordon... GORDON!
It works! It works!
If you had to get one right, Artie, I'm sure glad it was this one.
Let me tell you something about your beloved art of disguise, Gordon. That night at Fat Can's, it wasn't a difficult task to see that you weren't a woman.
I was propositioned by three men.
You looked nasty, just butt ugly. Your breasts were hard and stiff, and sticking out like rusty cannons on a sunken ship.
These breasts are a work of art. Aesthetically, and scientifically perfect.
They look like shit.
What's this?
Why, it's a deep, deep pool. Maybe it's your old swimming hole, General. Are you feeling sleepy?
Yes, I'm sleepy.
Good. Now you're going to be my little doggy, and when I say ""speak"" you're going to tell me everything I want to know. Understand?
Woof!
Good boy. Now, which scientist is that in the next room? Is it Dr. Escobar? Speak!
Woof! Woof!
You can speak words, you stupid mutt.
... I'll go as a riverboat captain, and you can go as my manservant.
Why, yessir, Mista Gawdon; Ah swears, Ah'd be delahghted! Ah'll sing, Ah'll dance for ya, sah! Oh, and Ah swears none of the otha whahte fawlks will evah knows dat
I'd rather shoot myself in the foot that play your goddamn manservant."
Lewis,AJ,Gadgeteer Genius,"Pop quiz: Who have you met, and what have you learned?
OK. Bud, Fritz, and Joe are brothers. Fritz is married to Petunia, and is she...?
Cranky? Yes.
Tallulah and Laszlo are their children. Joe is married to Billie. Lefty is the butler. Spike and Dimitri are twins, and I don't know who they're related to.
Neither do we. Go on.
Lucille is married to Bud, and your dad, Cornelius, is their son. What does Cornelius look like?
Tom Selleck.
OK. Cornelius is married to Franny, and her brothers are Gaston and Art.
You're forgetting something.
Forgetting? Oh, right! Wilbur is the son of Franny and Cornelius.
And nobody realized that you're from the past?
Nope.
Whew.
Thank you. Thank you. Hold your applause.
I don't even know what I'm doing.
Keep moving forward.
I mean, this stuff is way too advanced for me.
Keep moving forward.
And what if I can't fix this, what are we going to do?
Keep moving forward.
Why do you keep saying that? And don't just say keep moving forward!
It's my dad's motto.
Why would his motto be keep moving forward?
It's what he does.
Wait Lewis, one more thing.
Yeah?
Just a little tip for the future, I am always right. Even when I'm wrong, I'm right.

She's right. I would just go with it if I were you...
and I am.
Then you're absouletly right.
Alright, alright, I'm coming.
Well, it's not like you're never going to see them again. They are you're family after all.

Why is your dog wearing glasses?
Oh, because his insurance won't pay for contacts.
Five years ago, Dad wakes up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat. Wants to build a time machine. So he starts working! We're talking plans, we're talking scale models, we're talking prototypes!

That's a prototype?
The very first!... Or, what's left of it.
Yikes.
Yeah. Dark day at the Robinson household.
You did it Lewis, you did it!
I'll hold him while you run for help.
Let him go!
Wh-what are you doing? He's the bad guy!
No, he's not, he's my roommate...
What?

Look, I want you guys to adopt him.
Are you nuts?
Give me one good reason why no...
I'll give you three good reasons: one: he stole our time machine, two: he tried to ruin your future, and three: he smells like he hasn't showered in thirty years!
Don't forget I'm your father, you have to do what I say.
Goob, I had no idea!
Shut up! And don't call me ""Goob""! How many evil villians do you know that can pull off a name like ""Goob""? Bleh!
Look, I'm sorry your life turned out so bad. But don't blame me you messed it up yourself. You just focused on the bad stuff when all you had to do was... let go of the past and keep moving forward...
Hmm, let's see... take responsiblity for my own life or blame you? Dingdingdingdingding! Blame you wins hands down!

This area is not secure, get in.
Have you been approached a tall man in a bowler hat?
What?
Hey, hey, I'll ask the questions here.
Okay... goodbye.
Okay, I didn't want to pull rank on you but you forced my hand. Special agent Wilbur Robinson of the T.C.T.F.
What?
Time continuum task force. I'm here to protect you.
Now, tall man? Bowler hat? Approached you?
No, why?
I could lose my badge for this, he's a suspect in a robbery.
What did he steal?
A time machine.
A what?
I tracked him to this time and my informants say he's after you.
Me? Why me?
The boys back at HQ haven't figured out a motive yet.
And by ""HQ"" I mean headquarters.
I know what HQ means!
Good, you're a smart kid, that'll keep you alive... for now.
You just take care of your science gizmo and leave the perp to me.
And by perp, I mean perp...
I know what it means!
Okay, Mr. Smartypants.
he keeps working and working until finally, he gets it! The first working time machine! Then, he keeps working and working until finally, he gets it again! The second working time machine!
Kinda small.
I'm assuming that's a joke. I'm ignoring you for time reasons. This, my friend, is merely a model, because unfortunately, time machine number two is in the hands of the Bowler Hat Guy!
Take a good look around boys, because your future is about to change.
Lewis, you have to fix the time machine.
No-no, I-I can't!
What about your dad? You could call him!
You are my dad!
But that's in the future!
There won't be a future unless you fix the time machine!
Look, I messed up, I left the garage unlocked, but I tried like crazy to fix things! But now it's up to you...
You can do it, dad.
Lewis? Lewis!
Wilbur?
Wilbur...
Wait, what does Cornelius look like?
...Tom Selleck.
Hey, what're you doing up here?
Coo, coo, coo.
Coo, coo coo-coo coo.
Coo, coo.
Will you quit that please? I know you're not a pigeon!
Shh, you're blowing my cover!
But we're the only ones up here!
That's just what they want you to think.
Now, enough moping, take this back the science fair and fix that memory scanner!
Stop, stop, get away from me!
Maybe you forgotten I'm a time cop from the future.
Should be taken very seriously.
That's no badge, it's a coupon for a tanning salon!
You're a fake.
Okay, you got me, I'm not a cop. But I really am from the future! And there really is this bowler hat guy!
Agh, here we go again.
He stole a time machine, came to the science fair and ruined your project!
My project didn't work because I'm no good.
There is no bowler hat guy, there is no time machine and you're not really from the future. You're crazy!
Ho, ho, I am not crazy.
Oh, yeah captain time travel? Prove it!
Uh... um...
Yeah, that's what I thought.
I'm just going to lock myself in my room and hide under the covers for a couple of years.

If I prove to you that I'm from the future will you go back to the science fair?
Yeah, sure whatever you say.
Let go of me! What are you doing, let go of me!
Okay.
Welcome back, little buddy. So, uh, what's up with the stolen time machine? Did you find it?
Apparently not. And you managed to bust this one as well!
It'll be fixed before dad gets home.
And how d'you suppose that's gonna hap...
Who's that?
Wow! A real robot! Hi, I'm Lewis!
Well, that was unexpected.
As... was that.
If my family finds out that I brought you from the past, they'll bury me alive and dance on my grave! I'M NOT EXAGGERATING! Well, yes I am, but that's not the point! The point is, your hair's a dead giveaway.
Why would my hair be a dead giveaway?
That is an excellent question!
Wait! Where are you going?
Another excellent question!
So Lewis, are you in Wilbur's class?
No.
Yes!
Yes.
No!
Well, yes and no. Lewis is a new transfer student
Where you from Lewis?
Um, Canada?
I think you mean North Montana, hasn't been called Canada in years!
Do you know a Sam Gunderson?
It's a big country.
State!
Then, um, I didn't choose that one because it was gonna give me pimples so I choosed, um, another scary one cause for, um, all those years that I went for halloween I wasn't scary at all... I love baseball. It's my destiny to play that game. And I don't really care about winning. Well, like, now i do, cause, like, we've lost every game and I've gotten tired of it! I'm working like so hard, all the balls are getting thrown to me, I'm trying to catch like everyone. All of the people in the out field are all looking around, and, c'mon, lets play some baseball, ok? not the lazy game... They're here... Lewis? Lewis?
Goob? Hey Goob? I've finished it! They're gonna love this!
Why didn't you tell me you had a pet dinosaur?
Uhhh... because we don't!

Oowch!
THAT'S for not locking the garage door!
Oh, you know about that?
I know about everything.
Poor Mr. Herrington.
I KILLED HIM?
Allow me to shed some light on the subject.
My old room!
I think you mean OUR old room!
Ah, yes! It is I, Mike Yagoobian!
Is this proof enough for you?
Is it ever! I never thought that time travel could be possible in my lifetime, and here it is, right in front of me!
The truth will set you free, brother.
This is beyond anything I could have imagined.
This means I could really change my life.
That's right, you can. Next stop, science fair to fix your memory scanner.
Hey, I'm not going to fix that stupid memory scanner.
What?
Wilbur this is a *time machine*. Why should I fix my dumb invention when you can take me to see my mom now, in this ship?
Uh... um...
I can go back to that night and stop her from giving me up.
The answer is not a time machine.
It's this.
This? You wanna know what I think of this?
What are you doing?
I'm sorry, Wilbur. You don't know what I've lived through.
Lewis, no!
Let go!
You let go!
You're not the boss of me!
Yes, I am! You're twelve and I'm thirteen. That makes me older!
No, this can't be happening!
Oh, but Lewis, it's already happened...
I am NEVER going to invent you.
Now, go get that boy!
Oh! Aah!
What's going on? Why aren't you seizing the boy?
I have a big head... and little arms. I'm just not sure... how well this plan was thought through... Master?
Ugh, stupid, stupid, stupid!
Why are you doing this to me? I never did anything to you.
You still haven't figured it out?
Figured out what?
Well, let's see if this rings a bell: father of the future, inventor extraordinaire, ""Keep Moving Forward"" ?
That's not me, that's Wilbur's dad.
Are you saying that... I'm Wilbur's... dad?
Ooh, give the boy a prize! You grew up to be the founder of this wretched time, so I plan to destroy your destiny.
Easy peasy, rice and cheesy.
Well... so if I'm Wilbur's dad...
Keep going.
If I'm Wilbur's dad...
Yes, thank you, we've established that.
Ah, but... what does that have to do with you?
Aha! Allow me to shed some light on the subject.
My old room!
I think you mean 'our' old room.
What?
Yes! Yes, it is I, Mike Yagoobian!
Ugh!
I know, I'm disgusting, but one learns to love it.
How did you end up like this?
Well, it's a long and pitiful story, about a young boy with a dream. a dream of winning a Little League championship.
A dream that was ruined in the last inning. We lost by one run because of me.
Get him!
If I hadn't fallen asleep, I would have caught the ball! And we would have won! Do you understand?
For some reason, no one wanted to adopt me.
Whiz kid Cornelius Robinson graduates from college at age 14 - This year's Nobel Prize goes to a young Cornelius Robinson.
Hey Goob, what's up?
Cool binder, want to come over to my house today?
They all hated me. Eventually, they closed down the orphanage and everyone left... except me.
Cornelius Robinson rebuilds Inventco - Rrobinson reaches out to - Cornielius Robinson - Cornelius Robinson is now - Now here's another amazing...
It was then that I realized it wasn't my fault. It was yours! If you hadn't kept me up all night working on your stupid project, then I wouldn't have missed the catch, so I devised a brilliant plan to get revenge.
Robinson, you stink!
Then, just as I was on the brink of destroying Robinson Industries, I met 'her'.
We retreated to our villainous lair, where Doris spun a tale of deception and woe. Apparently, you invented her to be a helping hat, a slave to humankind... But Doris knew she was capable of so much more!
However, you didn't see her true potential...
Got it!
So you shut her down... or so you thought.
We both had a score to settle with you, and while my plan for revenge was brilliant, Doris's was... well, we went with Doris's, but I made a very, very important contribution. Together we made the perfect team.
Wilbur, make sure you shut that door tight, or else the alarm won't engage.
Yeah, Mom.
I went to your house, snuck in the garage, and stole the time machine. All thanks to that pointy-haired little kid who forgot to lock the garage door.
And now, all that's left is to return to Inventco, where I'll pass off your little gizmo as my own.
Allow me to shed some light on the subject.
My old room!
I think you mean 'our' old room.
What?
Ye-es! Yes, it is I, Mike Yagoobian!
Ugh!
I know, I'm disgusting, but one learns to love it.
How did you end up like this?
Well, it's a long and pitiful story, about a young boy with a dream, a dream of winning a Little League championship.

We retreated to our villainous lair, where Doris spun a tale of deception and woe. Apparently, you invented her to be a helping hat, a slave to humankind... But Doris knew she was capable of so much more... However, you didn't see her true potential...
Got it!
So you shut her down... or so you thought.
We both had a score to settle with you, and while my plan for revenge was brilliant, Doris's was... well, we went with Doris's. I made a very, very important contribution. Together, we made the perfect team.
It's not you. we just haven't found the right couple yet.
124.
What?
That's how many adoption interviews I've had, 124.
Oh Lewis, come on now, you're exaggerating just to make your... point.
Plus, I'm gonna be 13 next year, and you know how hard it is for a teenager to get adopted. I have no future, no one wants me!
That's not true, Lewis!
My own mother didn't even want me!
Now stop it! You do not know that!
Then why did she give me up?
She may not have been able to take care of you, did you ever think of that?
I am sure she was only thinking about what was best for you.
I never thought of it that way.
Maybe she wanted to keep you, but she had no choice.
You're right! My real mom is the only person who's ever wanted me.
Wait, I said 'maybe'.
If she wanted me then, she'll want me now!
What are you talking about?
I have to find her, Mildred, and when I do, she'll take me back, and we'll be a family again!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Lewis! You can't do that! No one knows anything about her, no one even saw her!
Wrong, I saw her... once, she's in here. I just have to remember.
Wilbur! Make sure you shut that door tight, or else the alarm won't engage.
Yeah, mom.
I went to your house, snuck in the garage, and stole the time machine... all thanks to that pointy-haired little kid who forgot to lock the garage door.
And now all that's left is to return to Inventco where I'll pass off your little gizmo as my own.
But you have no idea what that could do to this future!
I don't care! I just want to ruin your life,
Goob! I had no idea!
Shut up! And don't call me 'Goob'! How many evil villains do you know who can pull off a name like Goob? Bleh!
Look, I'm sorry your life turned out so bad, but don't blame me! You messed it up yourself, you just focused on the bad stuff when all you had to do was... let go of the past and... keep moving forward.
Hmm. let's see: take responsibility for my own life, or blame you? Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding! ""Blame you"" wins hands down!
This is gonna be the best day of my life!
We'll see you at 2:00 this afternoon. He'll be so excited you're coming. Bye-bye, now.
Yes! Hey, Goob - I mean, Michael, good luck at the big game today!
Easy win, those guys are a bunch of bums. I just hope I can stay awake.
Don't tell me, let me guess...
He was up all night, working on his stupid project.
But that's what happens when you get a science geek for a roommate.
Ahh, that's good joe.
All right, Einstein, you owe Michael big time.
Well, unlocking the secrets of the brain took a lot longer than I expected, but it's finished, Mildred; I re-calibrated the headset.
Now the neural circuits will connect! I've cracked the hippocampus!
Really? Okay, what?
Now to test it out.
Oh no, I'm late! I gotta go!
Wait a minute, Lewis, wait a minute.
I almost forgot what I came up here for. I know you have a lot on your plate today, but I've scheduled an interview for you this afternoon.
No thanks.
No thanks? Sweetheart, this is about being adopted, and you will be back here clean, happy, and on time.
I'm done with interviews, Mildred. I'm not gonna be rejected anymore.
Listen, I know where your head is, but I'm telling you, you have got to get out of the past and look to the future.
I am, and this is it. This is my future. I'm sorry.
Lewis? Honey?
How did you end up like this?
Well, it's a long and pitiful story, about a young boy with a dream. a dream of winning a Little League championship.
A dream that was ruined in the last inning. We lost by one run because of me.
Get him!
If I hadn't fallen asleep, I would have caught the ball, and we would have won! Do you understand?
For some reason, no one wanted to adopt me.
Whiz kid Cornelius Robinson graduates from college at age 14... This year's Nobel Prize goes to a young Cornelius Robinson...
Hey Goob, what's up?
Cool binder, want to come over to my house today?
They all hated me. Eventually, they closed down the orphanage and everyone left... except me.
Cornelius Robinson rebuilds Inventco... Robinson reaches out to... Cornielius Robinson... Cornelius Robinson is now... Now here's another amazing...
It was then that I realized it wasn't 'my' fault. It was yours! If you hadn't kept me up all night working on your stupid project, then I wouldn't have missed the catch. So I devised a brilliant plan to get my revenge.

Anakin Skywalker,"AJ, O, C, K","Gadgeteer Genius, Child Prodigy, Arrogant Kungfu Guy, Byronic Hero","How feel you?
Cold, sir.
Afraid are you?
No, sir.
See through you we can.
Be mindful of your feelings.
Your thoughts dwell on your mother.
I miss her.
Afraid to lose her I think, hmm?
What has that got to do with anything?
Everything! Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering. I sense much fear in you.
You're a Jedi Knight, aren't you?
What makes you think that?
I saw your laser sword. Only Jedi carry that kind of weapon.
Perhaps I killed a Jedi and took it from him.
I don't think so. No one can kill a Jedi.
I wish that were so.
Mom, you said that the biggest problem in the universe is no one helps each other.
I can't do it, Mom. I just can't do it.
Ani...
Will I ever see you again?
What does your heart tell you?
I hope so. Yes... I guess.
Then we will see each other again.
I will come back and free you, Mom. I promise.
Now, be brave, and don't look back. Don't look back.
Are you an angel?
What?
An angel. I've heard the deep space pilots talk about them. They live on the moons of Iego, I think. They're the most beautiful creatures in the universe.
You're a funny little boy. How do you know so much?
I listen to all the traders and star pilots who come through here. I'm a pilot, you know, and someday I'm going to fly away from this place.
You're a slave?
I'm a person and my name is Anakin.
All slaves have a transmitter placed somewhere in their body.
I've been working on a scanner to try and locate mine.
Any attempt to escape...
And they blow you up! BOOM!
How wude!
But what about mom? Is she free too? You're coming too, aren't you mom?
I tried to free your mother Anni, but Watto wouldn't have it.
Son, my place is here, my future is here. It is time for you to let go.
Now this is pod racing!
I've built a racer. It's the fastest ever! There's a big race tomorrow on Boonta Eve. You could enter my pod. It's all but finished...
Anakin, Watto won't let you...
Watto, doesn't know I've built it. You could make him think it was yours and you could get him to let me pilot it for you.
I don't want you to race Anni, it's awful. I die every time Watto makes you do it.
But mom, I love it. The prize money would more than pay for the parts they need.
Yippee!
What are midi-chlorians?
Midi-chlorians are a microscopic life form that resides within all living cells.
I know we're in trouble, just hang on!
Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit, and that's what I'm going to do!
Mom, you've always said the biggest problem in this Universe is that nobody helps each other.
I don't know if I'll ever see her again, I wanted to say goodbye.
We will tell her for you. We are sure her heart goes with you.
You won't walk away from this one, you slave scum!
Don't count on it, slimeball!
You're Bantha fodder!
I will come back and free you mom, I promise.
You were the chosen one! It was said that you would destroy the Sith, not join them! Bring balance to the force... not leave it in darkness!
I HATE YOU!
You were my brother, Anakin! I loved you!
It's over Anakin, I have the high ground.
You underestimate my power!
Don't try it.
Remember back to your early teachings. ""All who gain power are afraid to lose it."" Even the Jedi.
The Jedi use their power for good.
Good is a point of view, Anakin. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way, including their quest for greater power.
The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inward, only about themselves.
And the Jedi don't?
The Jedi are selfless... they only care about others.
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis ""the wise""?
No.
I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith who lived many years ago. He was so powerful and so wise that he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.
He could do that? He could actually save people from death?
The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.
What happened to him?
He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, and then one night, his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic that he could save others from death, but not himself.
Is it possible to learn this power?
Not from a Jedi.
You have allowed this dark lord to twist your mind, until now, until now you've become the very thing you swore to destroy.
Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan! I see through the lies of the Jedi. I do not fear the dark side as you do. I have brought peace, freedom, justice, and security to my new Empire.
Your new Empire?
Don't make me kill you.
Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic, to democracy.
If you're not with me, then you're my enemy.
Only a Sith deals in absolutes.
I will do what I must.
You will try.
Obi-Wan, may the force be with you.
Goodbye old friend. May the force be with you.
Anakin, I was so worried about you! Obi-Wan... told me terrible things!
What things?
He said... you turned to the Dark Side. That you... killed Younglings!
Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me.
He cares about us.
Us?
He knows. He wants to help you. Anakin, all I want is your love.
Love won't save you, Padme. Only my new powers can do that!
But at what cost? You're a good person, don't do this!
I won't lose you the way I lost my mother. I am becoming more powerful than any Jedi has ever dreamed of, and I'm doing it for you. To protect you.
Come away with me. Help me raise our child far away. Leave everything else behind while we still can!
No. Don't you see? We don't have to run away anymore! We no longer have to hide our love for each other. I am more powerful than the Chancellor, I... I can overthrow him! And together, you and I can rule the galaxy! We can make things the way we want them to be!
I don't believe what I'm hearing! Obi-Wan was right... you've changed! You have turned to the dark side! You're not Anakin anymore!
I don't want to hear any more about Obi-Wan. The Jedi turned against me. Don't you turn against me!
Anakin, you're breaking my heart! You're going down a path I cannot follow!
Because of Obi-Wan?
Because of what you've done... what you plan to do! Stop! Stop now... come back... I love you!
Liar! You're with him! You brought him here to kill me!
You turned her against me!
You have done that yourself.
You will not take her from me!
Your anger and lust for power have already done that.
What have I done?
You are fulfilling your destiny, Anakin. Become my apprentice. Learn to use the dark side of the Force. There's no turning back now.
I will do whatever you ask. Just help me save Padme's life. I can't live without her. If she dies, I don't know what I will do.
To cheat death is a power only one has achieved through centuries of the study of the Force. But if we work together, I know we can discover the secret to eternal life
I pledge myself to your teachings. To the ways of the Sith.
Good. Good! The Force is strong with you, Anakin Skywalker. A powerful Sith you will become. Henceforth, you shall be known as Darth... Vader.
Thank you... my Master.
Lord Vader... rise.
Premonitions, premonitions. These visions you have...
They are of pain, suffering. Death.
Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?
Someone.
Close to you?
Yes.
Careful you must be when sensing the future Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.
I won't let these visions come true, Master Yoda.
Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them do not. Miss them do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed that is.
What must I do, Master Yoda?
Train yourself to let go... of everything you fear to lose.
Master Windu, I must speak with you.
Not now, Skywalker. We have just received word that Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous. We're on our way to make sure the Chancellor returns emergency powers back to the Senate.
He won't give up his power. I just learned the terrible truth. I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith Lord.
A Sith Lord?
Yes, the one we've been looking for.
How do you know this?
He knows the ways of the Force. He's been trained to use the Dark Side.
Are you sure?
Absolutely.
Then our worst fears have been realized. We must move quickly if the Jedi Order is to survive.
What was that all about?
Well, R2 has been...
No loose wire jokes.
Did I say anything?
He's trying.
I didn't say anything.
I have failed you, Anakin. I have failed you.
I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over!
Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil!
From my point of view, the Jedi are evil!
Well, then you are lost!
This is the end for you, my master.
Love won't save you, Padme. Only my new powers can do that.
I know what's been troubling you. Listen to me. Don't continue to a be a pawn of the Jedi Council! Ever since I've known you, you have been seeking a life of great significance, far more than any Jedi.
Are you going to kill me?
I would certainly like to!
I know you would. I can feel your anger. It give you focus... makes you stronger.
I'm not going to die in childbirth, Anakin. I promise you.
No, I promise you.
Uh-oh.
We lost something.
Not to worry. We're still flying half a ship.
Anakin Skywalker. I expected someone with your reputation to be a little... older.
General Grievous... you're shorter than I expected.
Jedi scum!
We have a job to do, Anakin. Try not to upset him.
I'm going to put an end to this, once and for all!
You can't. He must stand trial.
He has control of the senate and all the courts. He is too dangerous to be left alive!
But, I'm too weak. Don't kill me.
That's not the Jedi way. He must live.
I need him!
NO!
Power, unlimited power!
Good, Anakin, good. Kill him.
Kill him now.
I shouldn't...
Do it!
I couldn't stop myself.
You did well, Anakin. He was too dangerous to be kept alive.
Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.
I shouldn't have done that. It's not the Jedi way.
It is only natural. He cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge. It wasn't the first time, Anakin. Remember what you told me about your mother and the Sand People.
Now, we must leave before more security droids arrive.
Are you all right? You're trembling. What's going on?
Something wonderful has happened. Ani, I'm pregnant.
You are so... beautiful.
It's only because I'm so in love.
No, it's because I'm so in love with you.
So love has blinded you?
Well, that's not exactly what I meant.
But it's probably true.
I sense Count Dooku.
I sense a trap.
Next move?
Spring the trap.
Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin. Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi. Learn to use the Dark Side of the Force and you will be able to save your wife from certain death.
What did you say? How do you know that...?
Use my knowledge, I beg you.
You're the Sith Lord!
This is where the fun begins.
I swear to you... I didn't ask to be put on the council.
But it's what you wanted. Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off. Anakin, I am on your side. I did not want to put you in this situation
What situation?
The Council wants you to report on all the Chancellor's dealings.
They want me to spy on the Chancellor? But that is treason!
We are at war, Anakin.
Anakin, let's be fair. Today you were the hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians.
All right. But you owe me one, and for not saving your skin for the tenth time.
*Ninth* time. That business on Cato Neimodia doesn't- doesn't count.
I hope you trust me, Anakin.
Of course.
I need your help, son. I want you to be the eyes, ears, and voice of the Republic. Anakin, I'm appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council.
Me? A Master? I'm overwhelmed, sir. But the Council elects its own members. They will never accept this.
I think they will. They need you, more than you know.
I'm going there to end this war. Wait for me until I return. Thing's will be different, I promise. Please wait for me.
The Separatists have been taken care of, my master.
It is finished then. You have restored peace and justice to the galaxy.
Easy! We're in a bit of a situation.
Did I miss something?
I missed you, Padmé.
I feel lost.
Lost?
Obi-Wan and the Council don't trust me.
They trust you with their lives.
Something's happening. I'm not the Jedi I should be. I want more. And I know I shouldn't.
Ray shields.
Wait a minute. How did this happen? We're smarter than this.
Apparently not. I say patience.
Patience?
Yes. R2 will be along in a few moments and then... he'll release us from the ray shields.
See? No problem.
Allow this appointment lightly, the council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.
I understand.
You are on the council, but we do not grant you the rank of master.
What? How can you do this? This is outrageous, it's unfair.
Take a seat, young Skywalker.
Forgive me master.
You brought him here to kill me!
Wait, Master. There is something I must know.
If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find.
I must know the truth, Master.
It can't be... It can't be...
The traitors have been taken care of, Lord Sidious.
Good... Good... you have done well, my apprentice. Now Lord Vader, go and bring peace to the Empire.
I can't watch any more.
Destroy the Sith we must.
Lock on to him R2.
Master, General Grievous's ship is directly ahead. The one crawling with Vulture droids.
Oh, I see it. Oh, this is going to be easy.
My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count.
Good. Twice the pride, double the fall.
From my point of view the Jedi are evil.
Then you are lost!
I'm going to turn you over to the Jedi.
Of course you should. But you can't be sure of their intentions.
I will learn the truth of all this quickly.
You have much wisdom, Anakin. But if I were to die, all the knowledge you seek about the true nature of the Force will be lost with me. Learn the power of the Dark Side, Anakin. The power to save Padmé.
Can you fly a cruiser like this?
You mean, do I know how to land what's left of this thing?
Roger...
Roger.
You're going to need me on this one, Master.
Oh, I agree. Though it could turn out to just be a wild bantha chase.
We got 'em, R2.
Chancellor.
You all right?
Count Dooku.
This time we'll do it together.
I was about to say that.
You can't be any match for him, he's a Sith Lord.
Chancellor Palpatine, Sith Lords are our specialty.
Your swords, please. You don't want to make a mess of things in front of the Chancellor.
You won't get away this time, Dooku.
I've been looking forward to this.
My powers are double since the last time we met, Count.
Good. Twice the pride, double the fall.
Get him!
You were the chosen one! It was said that you would destroy the Sith, not join them! Bring balance to the force... not leave it in darkness!
I HATE YOU!
You were my brother, Anakin! I loved you!
It's over Anakin, I have the high ground.

He has control of the senate and all the courts. He is too dangerous to be left alive!
But, I'm too weak. Don't kill me.
That's not the Jedi way. He must live.
I need him!
NO!
Power, unlimited power!
Good, Anakin, good. Kill him.
Kill him now.
I shouldn't...
Do it!
I couldn't stop myself.
You did well, Anakin. He was too dangerous to be kept alive.
Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.
I shouldn't have done that. It's not the Jedi way.
It is only natural. He cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge. It wasn't the first time, Anakin. Remember what you told me about your mother and the Sand People.
Now, we must leave before more security droids arrive.
Are you all right? You're trembling. What's going on?
Something wonderful has happened. Ani, I'm pregnant.
You are so... beautiful.
It's only because I'm so in love.
No, it's because I'm so in love with you.
So love has blinded you?
Well, that's not exactly what I meant.
But it's probably true.
I sense Count Dooku.
I sense a trap.
Next move?
Spring the trap.
Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin. Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi. Learn to use the Dark Side of the Force and you will be able to save your wife from certain death.
What did you say? How do you know that...?
Use my knowledge, I beg you.
You're the Sith Lord!
This is where the fun begins.
I swear to you... I didn't ask to be put on the council.
But it's what you wanted. Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off. Anakin, I am on your side. I did not want to put you in this situation
What situation?
The Council wants you to report on all the Chancellor's dealings.
They want me to spy on the Chancellor? But that is treason!
We are at war, Anakin.
Anakin, let's be fair. Today you were the hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians.
All right. But you owe me one, and for not saving your skin for the tenth time.
*Ninth* time. That business on Cato Neimodia doesn't- doesn't count.
I hope you trust me, Anakin.
Of course.
I need your help, son. I want you to be the eyes, ears, and voice of the Republic. Anakin, I'm appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council.
Me? A Master? I'm overwhelmed, sir. But the Council elects its own members. They will never accept this.
I think they will. They need you, more than you know.
I'm going there to end this war. Wait for me until I return. Thing's will be different, I promise. Please wait for me.
The Separatists have been taken care of, my master.
It is finished then. You have restored peace and justice to the galaxy.
Easy! We're in a bit of a situation.
Did I miss something?
I missed you, Padmé.
I feel lost.
Lost?
Obi-Wan and the Council don't trust me.
They trust you with their lives.
Something's happening. I'm not the Jedi I should be. I want more. And I know I shouldn't.
Ray shields.
Wait a minute. How did this happen? We're smarter than this.
Apparently not. I say patience.
Patience?
Yes. R2 will be along in a few moments and then... he'll release us from the ray shields.
See? No problem.
Allow this appointment lightly, the council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.
I understand.
You are on the council, but we do not grant you the rank of master.
What? How can you do this? This is outrageous, it's unfair.
Take a seat, young Skywalker.
Forgive me master.
You brought him here to kill me!
Wait, Master. There is something I must know.
If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find.
I must know the truth, Master.
It can't be... It can't be...
The traitors have been taken care of, Lord Sidious.
Good... Good... you have done well, my apprentice. Now Lord Vader, go and bring peace to the Empire.
I can't watch any more.
Destroy the Sith we must.
Lock on to him R2.
Master, General Grievous's ship is directly ahead. The one crawling with Vulture droids.
Oh, I see it. Oh, this is going to be easy.
My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count.
Good. Twice the pride, double the fall.
From my point of view the Jedi are evil.
Then you are lost!
I'm going to turn you over to the Jedi.
Of course you should. But you can't be sure of their intentions.
I will learn the truth of all this quickly.
You have much wisdom, Anakin. But if I were to die, all the knowledge you seek about the true nature of the Force will be lost with me. Learn the power of the Dark Side, Anakin. The power to save Padmé.
Can you fly a cruiser like this?
You mean, do I know how to land what's left of this thing?
Roger...
Roger.
You're going to need me on this one, Master.
Oh, I agree. Though it could turn out to just be a wild bantha chase.
We got 'em, R2.
Chancellor.
You all right?
Count Dooku.
This time we'll do it together.
I was about to say that.
You can't be any match for him, he's a Sith Lord.
Chancellor Palpatine, Sith Lords are our specialty.
Your swords, please. You don't want to make a mess of things in front of the Chancellor.
You won't get away this time, Dooku.
I've been looking forward to this.
My powers are double since the last time we met, Count.
Good. Twice the pride, double the fall.
Get him!
How feel you?
Cold, sir.
Afraid are you?
No, sir.
See through you we can.
Be mindful of your feelings.
Your thoughts dwell on your mother.
I miss her.
Afraid to lose her I think, hmm?
What has that got to do with anything?
Everything! Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering. I sense much fear in you.
You're a Jedi Knight, aren't you?
What makes you think that?
I saw your laser sword. Only Jedi carry that kind of weapon.
Perhaps I killed a Jedi and took it from him.
I don't think so. No one can kill a Jedi.
I wish that were so.
Mom, you said that the biggest problem in the universe is no one helps each other.
I can't do it, Mom. I just can't do it.
Ani...
Will I ever see you again?
What does your heart tell you?
I hope so. Yes... I guess.
Then we will see each other again.
I will come back and free you, Mom. I promise.
Now, be brave, and don't look back. Don't look back.
Are you an angel?
What?
An angel. I've heard the deep space pilots talk about them. They live on the moons of Iego, I think. They're the most beautiful creatures in the universe.
You're a funny little boy. How do you know so much?
I listen to all the traders and star pilots who come through here. I'm a pilot, you know, and someday I'm going to fly away from this place.
You're a slave?
I'm a person and my name is Anakin.
All slaves have a transmitter placed somewhere in their body.
I've been working on a scanner to try and locate mine.
Any attempt to escape...
And they blow you up! BOOM!
How wude!
But what about mom? Is she free too? You're coming too, aren't you mom?
I tried to free your mother Anni, but Watto wouldn't have it.
Son, my place is here, my future is here. It is time for you to let go.
Now this is pod racing!
I've built a racer. It's the fastest ever! There's a big race tomorrow on Boonta Eve. You could enter my pod. It's all but finished...
Anakin, Watto won't let you...
Watto, doesn't know I've built it. You could make him think it was yours and you could get him to let me pilot it for you.
I don't want you to race Anni, it's awful. I die every time Watto makes you do it.
But mom, I love it. The prize money would more than pay for the parts they need.
Yippee!
What are midi-chlorians?
Midi-chlorians are a microscopic life form that resides within all living cells.
I know we're in trouble, just hang on!
Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit, and that's what I'm going to do!
Mom, you've always said the biggest problem in this Universe is that nobody helps each other.
I don't know if I'll ever see her again, I wanted to say goodbye.
We will tell her for you. We are sure her heart goes with you.
You won't walk away from this one, you slave scum!
Don't count on it, slimeball!
You're Bantha fodder!
I will come back and free you mom, I promise."
Ling Ling Fat,AJ,Gadgeteer Genius,
Lucius Fox,AJ,Gadgeteer Genius,"Let me get this straight, you think that your client, one of the wealthiest and most powerful men in the world, is secretly a vigilante, who spends his nights beating criminals to a pulp with his bare hands, and your plan is to blackmail this person?
Good luck.
How will it hold up against dogs?
We talking Rottweilers or Chihuahuas? Should do fine against cats.
What about getting back into the plane?
I'd recommend a good travel agent.
Without it landing.
Now that's more like it, Mr. Wayne.

Let me get this straight. You think that your client, one of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the world, is secretly a vigilante who spends his nights beating criminals to a pulp with his bare hands; and your plan, is to *blackmail* this person?
Good luck.
It emits a high-frequency pulse for mapping an environment and records a response time.
Sonar. Just like a...
Like a *submarine*, Mr. Wayne. Like a submarine.
I need a new suit.
Yeah, three buttons is a little '90's, Mr. Wayne.
I'm not talking fashion, Mr. Fox, so much as function.
You want to be able to turn your head.
Sure would make backing out of the driveway easier.
Now, for high altitude jumps, you'll need oxygen and stabilizers; but I must say, compared to your usual requests, jumping out of an airplane is pretty straightforward.
And what about getting back into the plane?
I'd recommend a good travel agent.
Without it landing.
Now that's more like it. The CIA had a program back in the 60s for getting their people out of hotspots called Skyhook. We could look into that.
Perhaps you should read the instructions first?
Right.
No, I really came to tell you that our business deal has to be put on hold. You see, we can't afford to be seen to do business with whatever it is you're accused of being. I'm sure a businessman of your stature will understand.
I think, Mr. Fox, a simple phone call might have sufficed.
Mr. Wayne didn't want you to think that he was deliberately wasting your time.
Just accidentally wasting it.
That's very good, Mr. Lau. Accidentally. Very good.
Beautiful, isn't it?
Beautiful... unethical... dangerous. You've turned every cellphone in Gotham into a microphone.
And a high-frequency generator-receiver.
You took my sonar concept and applied it to every phone in the city. With half the city feeding you sonar, you can image all of Gotham. This is *wrong*.
I've gotta find this man, Lucius.
At what cost?
The database is null-key encrypted. It can only be accessed by one person.
This is too much power for one person.
That's why I gave it to you. Only you can use it.
Spying on 30 million people isn't part of my job description."
Mr. Perkins,AX,Morally Bankrupt Banker,"Do you know where the shrink ray is?
Duh? Back at my place.
Oh, is that right? Back at your place? Oh, that's cool. I guess Gru must just have one that LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE IT!
Oh. What? Th-those girls sold me cookies.
You don't have it? And yet you have the audacity to ask the bank for money?
Apparently.
Do you have any idea how lucrative this moon heist could be? I give you the opportunity of a lifetime and you just blow it!
No... I didn't.
Oh, really?
Yeah, just wait until Gru sees my latest weapon! Squid launcher! Oh, yeah!
Ah! There's a squid on my face!
Don't worry. The moon is as good as ours."
Patrick Bateman,AX,Morally Bankrupt Banker,"I have to return some videotapes.
There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward it I have now surpassed. My pain is constant and sharp, and I do not hope for a better world for anyone. In fact, I want my pain to be inflicted on others. I want no one to escape. But even after admitting this, there is no catharsis; my punishment continues to elude me, and I gain no deeper knowledge of myself. No new knowledge can be extracted from my telling. This confession has meant nothing.
I like to dissect girls. Did you know I'm utterly insane?
Howard, it's Bateman, Patrick Bateman. You're my lawyer so I think you should know: I've killed a lot of people. Some girls in the apartment uptown uh, some homeless people maybe 5 or 10 um an NYU girl I met in Central Park. I left her in a parking lot behind some donut shop. I killed Bethany, my old girlfriend, with a nail gun, and some man uh some old faggot with a dog last week. I killed another girl with a chainsaw, I had to, she almost got away and uh someone else there I can't remember maybe a model, but she's dead too. And Paul Allen. I killed Paul Allen with an axe in the face, his body is dissolving in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen. I don't want to leave anything out here. I guess I've killed maybe 20 people, maybe 40. I have tapes of a lot of it, uh some of the girls have seen the tapes. I even, um... I ate some of their brains, and I tried to cook a little. Tonight I, uh, I just had to kill a LOT of people. And I'm not sure I'm gonna get away with it this time. I guess I'll uh, I mean, ah, I guess I'm a pretty uh, I mean I guess I'm a pretty sick guy. So, if you get back tomorrow, I may show up at Harry's Bar, so you know, keep your eyes open.
Ask me a question.
So, what do you do?
I'm into, uh, well, murders and executions, mostly.
Do you like it?
Well, it depends. Why?
Well, most guys I know who are in Mergers and Acquisitions really don't like it.
Do you like Huey Lewis and The News?
They're OK.
Their early work was a little too new wave for my tastes, but when Sports came out in '83, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor.
Hey Halberstram.
Yes, Allen?
Why are there copies of the style section all over the place, d-do you have a dog? A little chow or something?
No, Allen.
Is that a rain coat?
Yes it is! In '87, Huey released this, Fore, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is ""Hip to be Square"", a song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity, and the importance of trends, it's also a personal statement about the band itself.
Hey Paul!
TRY GETTING A RESERVATION AT DORSIA NOW, YOU FUCKING STUPID BASTARD! YOU, FUCKING BASTARD!
There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman; some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me: only an entity, something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable... I simply am not there.
You're a fucking ugly bitch. I want to stab you to death, and then play around with your blood.
I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I'm 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine. In the morning if my face is a little puffy I'll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over, us, this is no joke. I don't think we should see each other any more.
But your friends are my friends and my friends are your friends. I really don't think it would work. You have a little something...
I know that your friends are my friends and, uh... I've thought about that. You can have 'em.
Would you like to hear today's specials?
Not if you want to keep your spleen.
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?
Ed Gein? The maitre 'd at Canal Bar?
No, serial killer, Wisconsin, the '50s.
So what did he say?
""When I see a pretty girl walking down the street, I think two things. One part wants me to take her out, talk to her, be real nice and sweet and treat her right.""
And what did the other part think?
""What her head would look like on a stick... ""
I have all the characteristics of a human being: blood, flesh, skin, hair; but not a single, clear, identifiable emotion, except for greed and disgust. Something horrible is happening inside of me and I don't know why. My nightly bloodlust has overflown into my days. I feel lethal, on the verge of frenzy. I think my mask of sanity is about to slip.
What's that?
Duct tape. I need it for... taping something.
Not the face! You bitch! Not the fucking face, you piece of bitch trash!
Do you like Phil Collins? I've been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before that, I really didn't understand any of their work. Too artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins' presence became more apparent. I think Invisible Touch was the group's undisputed masterpiece. It's an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time, it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums. Christy, take off your robe. Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance of every instrument. Sabrina, remove your dress. In terms of lyrical craftsmanship, the sheer songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism. Sabrina, why don't you, uh, dance a little. Take the lyrics to Land of Confusion. In this song, Phil Collins addresses the problems of abusive political authority. In Too Deep is the most moving pop song of the 1980s, about monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything I've heard in rock. Christy, get down on your knees so Sabrina can see your asshole. Phil Collins' solo career seems to be more commercial and therefore more satisfying, in a narrower way. Especially songs like In the Air Tonight and Against All Odds. Sabrina, don't just stare at it, eat it. But I also think Phil Collins works best within the confines of the group, than as a solo artist, and I stress the word artist. This is Sussudio, a great, great song, a personal favorite.
New card. What do you think?
Whoa-ho. Very nice. Look at that.
Picked them up from the printer's yesterday.
Good coloring.
That's bone. And the lettering is something called Silian Rail.
It's very cool, Bateman, but that's nothing. Look at this.
That is really nice.
Eggshell with Romalian type. What do you think?
Nice.
Jesus. That is really super. How'd a nitwit like you get so tasteful?
I can't believe that Bryce prefers Van Patten's card to mine.
But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet. Raised lettering, pale nimbus. White.
Impressive. Very nice.
Hmm.
Let's see Paul Allen's card.
Look at that subtle off-white coloring. The tasteful thickness of it. Oh, my God. It even has a watermark.
Is something wrong, Patrick? You're sweating.
Hey, I'm a child of divorce, gimme a break!
You're inhuman.
No... I'm in touch with humanity.
I'm on a diet.
What, you're kidding, right? You look great... so fit... and thin.
Well, you can always be thinner... look better.
Then maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I wouldn't want you to lose your willpower.
That's okay. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
Come on, Bryce. There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about.
Like what?
Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world hunger. We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless, and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights, while also promoting equal rights for women. We have to encourage a return to traditional moral values. Most importantly, we have to promote general social concern and less materialism in young people.
Patrick. How thought-provoking.
There is a moment of sheer panic when I realize that Paul's apartment overlooks the park... and is obviously more expensive than mine.
He was into that whole Yale thing.
Yale thing?
Yeah, Yale thing.
What whole Yale thing?
Well, for one thing, I think he was probably a closet homosexual who did a lot of cocaine. That whole Yale thing.
I think, um, Evelyn that, uh, we've lost touch.
Why? What's wrong?
My need to engage in homicidal behaviour on a massive scale cannot be corrected but, uh, I have no other way to fulfill my needs.
Don't you want to know what I do?
No. No, not really.
Well, I work on Wall Street... for Pierce & Pierce. Have you heard of it?
You have a really nice place here, Paul. How much did you pay for it?
Well, actually, that's none of your business, Christie. But I can assure you, it certainly wasn't cheap.
Where are you going?
I am just leaving.
But where?
I have to return some videotapes.
I don't want to get you drunk, but, ah, that's a very fine Chardonnay you're not drinking.
Patrick? Is that you?
No Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
Look at that subtle off-white coloring. The tasteful thickness of it. Oh my God, it even has a watermark!
They don't have a good bathroom to do coke in.
Are you sure that's Paul Allen over there?
Yes. McDufus, I am.
He's handling the Fisher account.
Lucky bastard.
Lucky Jew bastard.
Jesus, McDermott, what does that have to do with anything?
I've seen that bastard sitting in his office, talking on the phone to the CEOs, spinning a fucking menorah.
Not a menorah. You spin a dreidel.
Oh, my God. Bateman, do you want me to fry you up some fucking potato pancakes? Some latkes?
No. Just cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks.
Oh, I forgot. Bateman's dating someone from the ACLU.
The voice of reason... the boy next door.
Speaking of reasonable, only $570...
I know my behavior can be... *erratic* sometimes.
Huey Lewis and the News. Great stuff! I just bought it on my way here. You heard it?
Never. I mean I don't really like singers.
Not a big music fan, huh?
No, I like music. Just they're... Huey's too black sounding for me.
Patrick, where did you get that overnight bag?
Jean Paul Gaultier.
Thousands of roses and lots of chocolate truffles. Godiva, and oysters in the half-shell.
I'm trying to listen to the new Robert Palmer tape, but Evelyn, my supposed fiancée, keeps buzzing in my ear.
Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll have to get someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.
Do what?
Get married. Have a wedding.
No, I can't take the time off work.
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
I don't want to talk about it.
You hate that job anyway. I don't see why you just don't quit.
Because I want to fit in.
Evelyn, I'm sorry. I just, uh... you're not terribly important to me.
I think if you stay, something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you. You don't want to get hurt, do you?
No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised.
I'm on the verge of tears by the time we arrive at Espace, since I'm positive we won't have a decent table. But we do, and relief washes over me in an awesome wave.
What are you so fucking zany about?
I'm just a happy camper! Rockin' and a-rollin'!
Paul Allen has mistaken me for this dickhead Marcus Halberstram. It seems logical because Marcus also works at P&P; and in fact does the same exact thing I do and he also has a penchant for Valentino suits and Oliver Peoples glasses. Marcus and I even go to the same barber, although I have a slightly better haircut.
You're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?
If they have a great personality and they're not great looking... then who fucking cares?
Well, let's just say hypotetically ok? What if they have a great personality?
I know, I know.
, , :
There are no girls with good personalities.
, , :
There are no girls with good personalities.
, , :
There are no girls with good personalities.
A good personality consists of a chick with a little hard body, who will satisfy all sexual demands without being too slutty about things, and who essentially will keep her dumb fucking mouth shut.
The only girls with good personalities who are smart or maybe funny or halfway intelligent or talented, though god knows what the fuck that means, are ugly chicks.
Absolutely.
And this is because they have to make up for how fucking unnattractive they are.
Stop it, I'm...
on a lot of lithium?
Are you dating anyone?
Maybe. I don't know... Not really.
Pumpkin, you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York. Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
Patrick, stop calling me pumpkin, OK?
Listen, you'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at the Four Seasons in 20 minutes.
I'm leaving. I've assessed the situation, and I'm going.
Hamilton, have a holly-jolly Christmas.
Don't touch the watch.
Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP, called simply Whitney Houston had 4 number one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie?
You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You own a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?
It's hard to choose a favorite among so many great tracks, but ""The Greatest Love of All"" is one of the best, most powerful songs ever written about self-preservation, dignity. Its universal message crosses all boundaries and instills one with the hope that it's not too late to better ourselves. Since, Elizabeth, it's impossible in this world we live in to empathize with others, we can always empathize with ourselves. It's an important message, crucial really. And it's beautifully stated on the album.
It's a fucking milligram of sweetener. I want to get high off this, not sprinkle it on my fucking oatmeal.
Definitely weak, but I have a feeling that if we do enough of it we'll be okay.
Will you keep it down? I'm trying to do drugs!
Fuck you! Calm down. Let's do it anyway. That is if the FAGGOT in the next stall thinks it's okay!
FUCK YOU!
HEY FUCK YOU! Sorry, dude. Steroids. Okay, let's do it.
Your compliment was sufficient, Luis.
'Oh Africa Brave Africa'. It was... a laugh riot.
Not quite blonde, are we? More of a dirty blonde.
This is really a beehive of, uh, activity, Halberstam. This place is hot, very hot.
Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here.
Yeah, well. You're late.
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break.
Hmmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime Jell-O.
Is that Ivana Trump over there? Jeez, Patrick, I mean Marcus, what are you thinking? Why would Ivana be at Texarkana?
Now, John, you've to wear clothes in proportion to your physique. There are definite dos and don'ts, good buddy of wearing a bold striped shirt. A bold stripe shirt calls for solid colored or discreetly patterned suits and ties.
Yes, always tip the stylist 15%. Listen, John, I've gotta go, T. Boone Pickens just walked in.
Just joking. No, don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay John? Right? Got it.
Hi, this is Paul Allen. I'm being called away to London for a few days. Meredith, I'll call you when I get back. Hasta la vista, baby.
Mistletoe alert!
I'm fairly certain that Timothy Bryce and Evelyn are having an affair. Timothy is the only interesting person I know. I'm almost completely indifferent as to whether Evelyn knows I'm having an affair with Courtney Rawlinson, her closest friend. Courtney is almost perfect looking. She's usually operating on one or more psychiatric drugs; tonight I believe it's Xanax. More disturbing than the drug use, though, is the fact that she's engaged to Luis Carruthers, the biggest dufus in the business.
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie?
Who's Ted Bundy?
When I get to Paul Allen's place, I use the keys I took from his pocket. There is a moment of sheer panic when I realize that Paul's apartment overlooks the park and is obviously more expensive than mine. I calm myself and move into the bedroom, where I find his suitcase and start to pack.
That's a very fine chardonnay you're drinking. I want you to clean your vagina.
What about the past?
We never really shared one.
Listen Patrick, can we talk?
You look... marvelous. There's nothing to say.
The world just opens up and swallows them.
Eerie. Very eerie.
We're not through yet.
I killed Paul Allen. And I liked it.
I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment. Was that anything important?
Oh, that? Just mulling over business problems, examining opportunities, exchanging rumors, spreading gossip.
Face it. The Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the 90's.
Shut up, Carnes. They will not.
So, Harold, did you get my message?
Jesus, yes! That was hilarious! That was you, wasn't it?
Yeah, naturally.
Bateman killing Allen and the escort girls. That's fabulous. That's rich.
What exactly do you mean?
The message you left. By the way, Davis, how's Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?
W-w-wait, Harold. What do you mean?
Excuse me. Nothing. It's good to see you.
Is that Edward Towers?
Wait, um...
Davis, I'm not one to badmouth anyone. Your joke was amusing, but come on, man. You had one fatal flaw. Bateman is such a dork. Such a boring spineless lightweight.
Now if you said Bryce or McDermott... Otherwise, it was amusing. Now if you'll excuse me, I really must be going.
Wait, um... stop.
I did it, Carnes. I killed him. *I'm* Patrick Bateman. I chopped Allen's fucking head off.
The whole message I left on your machine was true.
Excuse me. I really must be going now.
No, listen! Don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis. I'm Patrick Bateman.
We talked on the phone all the time. Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.
Now, Carnes, listen. Listen very, very carefully... I killed Paul Allen, and I liked it.
I can't make myself any clearer.
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
It never was supposed to be. Why isn't it possible?
It's just not.
Why not, you stupid bastard?
Because I had dinner with Paul Allen twice in London, just 10 days ago.
No, you...
... didn't.
Now if you'll excuse me.
New York Matinee called it ""a playful but mysterious little dish"".
I'm not here.
Get a god-damn job Al.
Make someone happy. Have you ever wanted to?
I'm looking for, uh...
I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.
Just say no.
Wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?
Well, Halberstram, I could tell you... but then I'd have to kill ya.
He makes himself out to be a harmless old codger, but inside... inside...
... ""but inside"" doesn't matter.
""Inside,"" yes, ""inside... "" - believe it or not, Bryce, we're actually listening to you...
Come on, Bateman, what do you think?
Whatever.
You hate that job anyway. I don't see why you don't just quit.
Because I want to fit in.
Jean, I'm not going to make it... I'm not going to... make it... to the office this afternoon.
What is it, Patrick? Are you all right?
Stop sounding so fucking... sad! *Jesus*!
And where did he go to school?
Don't you know all this?
I just wanted to know if you know.
Do you take credit card? Just joking.
You saw the ad in the Times?
No... Yeah, I mean yeah, in the Times.
There was no ad in the Times. I think you should go now.
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
Do you feel that way?
No, not really.
What do you do?
She's my... cousin.
Mm-hmm.
She's from... France.
If you don't shut your fucking mouth, I will kill you.
Will you call me before Easter?
Maybe.
Just cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks.
Pumpkin, you're dating an asshole.
Negative. Cancel it.
What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.
I just have some questions about Paul Allen and yourself.
Coffee?
No, I'm okay.
Apollinaris?
No, I'm okay.
Can you bring Mr...?
Kimball.
Mr. Kimball a bottle of Apollinaris. It's no problem.
So, what's the topic of discussion?
What are those?
Oh, uh, it's - cranberry juice. Uh, cran-apple."
Henry F. Potter,"R, AX","Corrupt Corporate Executive, Morally Bankrupt Banker","George, I am an old man, and most people hate me. But I don't like them either so that makes it all even.
Look at you. You used to be so cocky. You were going to go out and conquer the world. You once called me ""a warped, frustrated, old man""! What are you but a warped, frustrated young man? A miserable little clerk crawling in here on your hands and knees and begging for help. No securities, no stocks, no bonds, nothin' but a miserable little $500 equity in a life insurance policy.
You're worth more dead than alive! Why don't you go to the riffraff you love so much and ask them to let you have $8,000? You know why? Because they'd run you out of town on a rail. But I'll tell you what I'm going to do for you, George. Since the state examiner is still here, as a stockholder of the Building and Loan, I'm going to swear out a warrant for your arrest. Misappropriation of funds, manipulation, malfeasance...
All right, George, go ahead! You can't hide in a little town like this!
Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter!
And Happy New Year to you, in jail! Why don't you go on home? They're waiting for you!
I'm in trouble, Mr. Potter. I need help. Through some sort of an accident, my company's short in their accounts. The bank examiner got there today. I've got to raise eight thousand dollars immediately.
Oh, that's what the reporters wanted to talk to you about.
The reporters?
Yes. They called me up from your Building and Loan. Oh, there's a man over there from the D.A.'s office, too. He's looking for you.
Please help me, Mr. Potter. Help me, won't you, please? Can't you see what it means to my family? I'll pay any sort of a bonus on the loan, any interest, if you still want the Building and Loan...
George, could it possibly be there's a slight discrepancy in the books?
No, sir, there's nothing wrong with the books. I've just misplaced eight thousand dollars. I can't find it anywhere.
*You* misplaced eight thousand dollars?
Yes, sir.
Have you notified the police?
No, sir. I didn't want the publicity. Harry's homecoming tomorrow...
They're going to believe that one. What've you been doing, George? Playing the market with the company's money?
No sir. No sir, I haven't.
Is it a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
What?
Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me? Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?
I can't get a hold of him. He's in Europe.
Well, what about all your other friends?
They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.
I've suddenly become quite important. What kind of security what I have, George? Have you gotten any stocks? Bonds? Real estate? Collateral of any kind?
Well, I have some life insurance. A fifteen thousand dollar policy.
Yes. How much is your equity in it?
Five hundred dollars.
Five hundred dollars? And you ask me to lend you eight thousand?
What have you been doing lately, George? Playing the market with the company's money?
No, of course not.
Or is it a woman you're involved with? It's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
What?
Not that it's any skin off my nose.
George, I am an old man and most people hate me. But I don't like them either, so that makes it all even. You know just as well as I do that I run practically everything in this town but the Bailey Building and Loan. You know, also, that for a number of years I've been trying to get control of it. Or kill it. But I haven't been able to do it. You have been stopping me. In fact, you have beaten me, George, and as anyone in this county can tell you, that takes some doing. Now take during the depression, for instance. You and I were the only ones that kept our heads. You saved the Building and Loan, I saved all the rest.
Yes, well, most people say you stole all the rest.
The envious ones say that, George. The suckers. Now, I have stated my side very frankly. Now let's look at your side. A young man, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, married, making, say, forty a week.
Forty-five!
Forty-five. Forty-five. Out of which, after supporting your mother and paying your bills, you're able to keep, say, ten, if you skimp. A child or two comes along and you won't even be able to save the ten. Now, if this young man of twenty-eight was a common, ordinary yokel, I'd say he was doing fine. But George Bailey is not a common, ordinary yokel. He is an intelligent, smart, ambitious, young man who hates his job, who hates the Building and Loan almost as much as I do. A young man who's been dying to get out on his own ever since he was born. A young man... the smartest one in the crowd, mind you... A young man who has to sit by and watch his friends go places because he's trapped. Yes, sir, trapped into frittering his life away, playing nursemaid to a lot of garlic eaters. Do I paint the correct picture or do I exaggerate?
Have you put any real pressure on these people of yours to pay those mortgages?
Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of these people are out of work.
Well, then, foreclose.
I can't do that. These families have children.
They're not my children.
But they're somebody's children, Mr. Potter.
Are you running a business or a charity ward? Not with my money!
Mr. Potter, what makes you such a hard-skulled character? You have no family, no children. You can't begin to spend all the money you've got.
Oh, I suppose I should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me!
He's not a failure! You can't say that about my father!
George. George. Quiet, George. Run along. Run along.
You're not! You're the biggest man in town!
Bigger than him, bigger than everybody!
Gives you an idea of the Baileys.
Peter Bailey was not a businessman. That's what killed him. Oh, I don't mean any disrespect to him, God rest his soul. He was a man of high ideals. So called. But ideals without common sense can ruin this town. Now, you take this loan here to Ernie Bishop. You know, that fellow that sits around all day on his brains in his taxi, you know. I happen to know the bank turned down this loan, but he comes *here* and we're building him a house worth five thousand dollars. Why?
Well, I handled that, Mr. Potter. You have all the papers there. His salary, insurance. I can personally vouch for his character.
A friend of yours?
Yes, sir.
Uh-huh. You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money. What does that get us? A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas!
George, there is a rumor around town that you closed your doors. Is that true?
Oh, well, I'm very glad to hear that. George, are you all right? Do you need any police?
Police? What for?
Well, mobs get pretty ugly sometimes, you know. George, I'm going all out to help in this crisis. I've just guaranteed the bank sufficient funds to meet their needs. They'll close up for a week and then reopen.
He just took over the bank.
I may lose a fortune, but I'm willing to guarantee your people, too. Just tell them to bring their shares over here and I will pay fifty cents on the dollar.
Aw, you never miss a trick, do you, Potter? Well, you're going to miss this one!
If you close your doors before six p.m., you will never re-open!
Fifteen years ago, a half-dozen houses stuck here and there. There's the old cemetery, squirrels, buttercups, daisies. Dozens of the prettiest little homes you ever saw. Ninety per cent owned by suckers who used to pay rent to you. Your Potter's Field, my dear Mr. Employer, is becoming just that. And are the local yokels making with those David and Goliath wisecracks!
Oh, they are, are they? Even thought they know the Baileys haven't made a dime out of it.
You know very well why. The Baileys were all chumps. Every one of these homes is worth twice what it cost the Building and Loan to build. If I were you, Mr. Potter...
Well, you are not me.
As I say, it's no skin off my nose. But one of these days this bright young man is going to be asking George Bailey for a job.
He
was a man of high ideals, so called. Ideals without common sense can ruin this town.
Ernie Bishop, you know the fella who sits around all day on his brains in his taxi?
The Bailey family's been a boil on my neck long enough.
You're not talking to someone else? You know me, remember me, George Bailey?
George Bailey. George Bailey, whose ship has just come in. Provided he has enough brains to climb aboard.
How does slacker George feel about that?
Very jealous, very jealous. He only lost three buttons off his vest.
George, I am an old man, and most people hate me. But I don't like them either so that makes it all even.
Look at you. You used to be so cocky. You were going to go out and conquer the world. You once called me ""a warped, frustrated, old man""! What are you but a warped, frustrated young man?

James Bond,"V, N, K, AO, I","Cultured Badass, Charmer, Byronic Hero, Heartbroken Badass, Bruiser With A Soft Center","What else can you surmise, Mr. Bond?
About you, Miss Lynd? Well, your beauty's a problem. You worry you won't be taken seriously.
Which one can say of any attractive woman with half a brain.
True. But this one overcompensates by wearing slightly masculine clothing. Being more aggressive than her female colleagues. Which gives her a somewhat *prickly* demeanor, and ironically enough, makes it less likely for her to be accepted and promoted by her male superiors, who mistake her insecurities for arrogance. Now, I'd have normally gone with ""only child,"" but, you see, by the way you ignored the quip about your parents... I'm gonna have to go with ""orphan.""
All right... by the cut of your suit, you went to Oxford or wherever. Naturally you think human beings dress like that. But you wear it with such disdain, my guess is you didn't come from money, and your school friends never let you forget it. Which means you were at that school by the grace of someone else's charity: hence that chip on your shoulder. And since your first thought about me ran to ""orphan,"" that's what I'd say you are.
Oh, you are? I like this poker thing. And that makes perfect sense! Since MI6 looks for maladjusted young men, who give little thought to sacrificing others in order to protect Queen and country. You know... former SAS types with easy smiles and expensive watches.
Rolex?
Omega.
Beautiful. Now, having just met you, I - wouldn't go as far as calling you a cold-hearted bastard...
No, of course not.
But it wouldn't be a stretch to imagine. You think of women as disposable pleasures, rather than meaningful pursuits. So as charming as you are, Mr. Bond, I will be keeping my eye on our government's money - and off your perfectly-formed arse.
You noticed?
Even accountants have imagination. How was your lamb?
Skewered! One sympathizes.
Good evening, Mr. Bond.
Good evening, Ms. Lynd.
Vodka-martini.
Shaken or stirred?
Do I look like I give a damn?
Why is it that people who can't take advice always insist on giving it?
I'm sorry. That last hand... nearly killed me.
We've been involved for quite a long while. Hence, the shared suite.
But, my family is strict Roman Catholic. So, for appearances sake, it'll be a two bedroom suite.
I do *hate* it when religion comes between us.
Religion - and a securely locked door. Am I going to have a problem with you, Bond?
No, don't worry, you're not my type.
Smart?
Single.
Dry Martini.
Oui, monsieur.
Wait... three measures of Gordon's; one of vodka; half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake it over ice, and add a thin slice of lemon peel.
Yes, sir.
You know, I'll have one of those.
So will I.
Certainly.
My friend, bring me one as well, keep the fruit.
That's it? Hm? Anyone want to play poker now?
Someone's in a hurry.
I've got a little itch, down there. Would you mind?
Now the whole world's gonna know that you died scratching my balls!
Oh... I died? I died?
Yeah! 'Cause no matter what you do, I'm not gonna give you the password which means your clients are gonna hunt you down and cut you into little pieces of meat while you're still breathing. Because if you kill me, there'll be nowhere else to hide.
But you are SO WRONG! 'Cause even after I slaughtered you and your little girlfriend, your people would still welcome me with open arms... because they need... what I know.
The big picture.
Give me the password, and I will at least let her live.
Bond, do it soon enough and she might even be in one piece.
You *really* aren't going to tell me, are you?
No.
You love me?
Enough to travel the world with you until one of us has to take an honest job... which I think is going to have to be you, because I have no idea what an honest job is.
You can switch off so easily, can't you? It doesn't bother you? Killing those people?
Well I wouldn't be very good at my job if it did.
I think I'll call it a Vesper.
Because of the bitter aftertaste?
No, because once you've tasted it, that's all you want to drink.
You changed your shirt, Mr Bond. I hope our little game isn't causing you to perspire.
A little. But I won't consider myself to be in trouble until I start weeping blood.
The job's done and the bitch is dead.
You don't trust anyone, do you?
No.
Then you've learned your lesson.
You're not going to let me in there, are you? You've got your armour back on. That's that.
I have no armour left. You've stripped it from me. Whatever is left of me - whatever is left of me - whatever I am - I'm yours.
I'm the money.
Every penny of it.
The name's Bond... James Bond.
I can't resist waking you. Every time I do, you look at me as if you hadn't seen me in years. Makes me feel reborn.
If you had just been born, wouldn't you be naked?
I love you too M.
I always thought M was a randomly assigned initial, I had no idea it stood for...
Utter one more syllable and I'll have you killed.
I'm sorry I'm not sorry.
Stay calm and don't interrupt. Because you'll be dead within two minutes unless you do exactly what I tell you.
I'm all ears.
I knew it was too early to promote you.
Well, I understand 00s have a very short life expectancy... so your mistake will be short-lived.
I have a dinner jacket.
There are dinner jackets and dinner jackets; this is the latter. And I need you looking like a man who belongs at that table.
How?... It's tailored.
I sized you up the moment we met.
I'll kill her!
Allow me.
I should have introduced myself, seeing as we're related. Felix Leiter, a brother from Langley.
You should have faith. As long as you keep your head about you, I think you have him.
Had. Excuse me.
You're not buying in?
No.
Listen, I'm bleeding chips. I'm not going to last much longer. You have a better chance. I'll stake you. I'm saying I'll give you the money to keep going. Just one thing: you pull it off, the CIA bring him in.
What about the winnings?
Does it look like we need the money?
I'm afraid I'm a complicated woman.
That is something to be afraid of.
I would ask you if you could remain emotionally detached, but that's not your problem, is it, Bond?
No.
Oh, and the valet ticket.
M doesn't mind you earning a little money on the side, Dryden. She'd just prefer it if it wasn't selling secrets.
If the theatrics are supposed to scare me, you have the wrong man, Bond. If M was so sure that I was bent, she'd have sent a 00. Benefits of being section chief, I'd know if anyone had been promoted to 00 status, wouldn't I? Your file shows no kills, and it takes...
Two.
Shame... we barely got to know each other.
I know where you keep your gun. I suppose that's something.
True. How did he die?
Your contact? Not well.
Made you feel it, did he? Well, you needn't worry. The second is...
Yes... considerably
Hello?

What is it about bad men? You... my husband. I had so many chances to be happy, so many nice guys. Why can't nice guys be more like you?
Because then they'd be bad.
Mmmmm, yes...! But, so much more interesting.
Shame. We barely got to know each other.
I know where you keep your gun. Suppose that's something.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Now wouldn't seem an appropriate time.
Do you want a clean kill or do you want to send a message?
You know, James, I just want you to know that if all that was left of you was your smile and your little finger, you'd still be more of a man than anyone I've ever met.
That's because you know what I can do with my little finger.
I have no idea.
But you're aching to find out.
I'm Mr. Arlington Beech, professional gambler, and you're Miss Stephanie Broadchest...
I am not!
You're going to have to trust me on this.
Oh no I don't.
Stop touching your ear.
Sorry?
Put your hand down!
Vesper? I do hope you gave your parents hell for that.
You've got a bloody cheek!
Sorry. I'll shoot the camera first next time.
Or yourself. You stormed into an Embassy. You violated the only absolutely inviolate rule of international relations, and why? So you could kill a nobody. We wanted to question him, not to kill him! For God's sake! You're supposed to display some kind of judgement.
I did. I thought one less bomb maker in the world would be a good thing.
Exactly. One bomb maker. We're trying to figure out how an entire network of terrorist groups is financed and you give us one bomb maker. Hardly the big picture, wouldn't you say?
You OK?
Me?
Thank you.
You're welcome. Now get yourself off to a hospital.
I will do. As soon as I've won this game.
You're not seriously going back there?
I wouldn't dream of it.
Well, I'm gonna need the other five million to buy back in.
I can't do that, James.
Look, I made a mistake. I was impatient, maybe I was arrogant, but I can beat him.
I'm sorry.
""Sorry?"" Sorry! Why don't you try putting that in a sentence, like maybe, ""Sorry Le Chiffre's gonna win, continue funding terror and killing innocent people!"" That kind of ""sorry""?
You lost because of your ego, and that same ego can't take it! That's what this is all about. All you're going to do now is lose more.
Well then, you're an idiot.
I'm sorry?
I said you're a bloody idiot! Look in my eyes. I can beat this man - you know that.
Get your hand off my arm.
Looks like our man, burn scars on his face.
Hmm. I wonder if bomb-makers are insured for things like that.
So you want me to be half-monk, half-hitman.
Any thug can kill. I need you to take your ego out of the equation.
What makes your husband a bad man?
His nature, I suppose.
The nature of his work?
The mystery, I'm afraid. I'm also afraid you will sleep with me in order to get to him.
How afraid?
Oh, not enough to stop.
Apparently, he's on the last flight to Miami. So, you have all night to question me.
In that case, we're gonna need - some more champagne.
Good evening. Can I get a bottle of chilled Bollinger Grande Année and the Beluga caviar?
Benefits of being section chief. I'd know if anyone had been promoted to 00 status, wouldn't I? Your file shows no kills, and it takes...
Two.
It was worth it to discover his ""tell"".
What'd you mean ""tell""?
The twitch he has to hide when he bluffs.
Bluffs? He had the best hand.
He won the hand with the river card. The odds against are twenty-three to one, and he'd know that. When he made his first raise, he had nothing. Winning was blind luck.
Could you do me a favor? I was here for dinner last night and I parked my car next to a very beautiful 1964 Aston Martin - and I'm ashamed to say I nicked the door. You wouldn't happen to know...
Mr. Dimitrios.
Right.
If he hasn't noticed, I'm not sure I'd mention it. He isn't the type to take bad news well.
You can stop pretending. You knew I wouldn't let this drop, didn't you?
Well, I knew you were you.
You want to do what to me?
You've lost me, completely.
You said you can't wait to get me back to the room, come on.
Can I give you a lift home?
That would really send him over the edge. I'm afraid I'm not that corrupt.
Well, perhaps you're just out of practice.
What about a drink at my place?
Your place? Is it close?
Very.
One drink.
She was tortured first. As you'd already killed her husband, she must have been the only one left to question. Did she know anything that could compromise you?
No.
Not your name? What you were after?
No.
So you're telling me its a matter of probability and chance. I was worried there wasn't chance involved.
Well, usually the player with the best hand wins.
So, that would be what you call bluffing.
You've heard the term. Then you also know in poker you never play your hand. You play the man across from you.
And you're good at reading people?
Yes, I am. Which is why I've been able to detect an undercurrent of sarcasm in your voice.
You don't think this is a very good plan, do you?
So there is a plan? I got the impression we were risking millions of dollars and hundreds of lives on a game of luck.
Look, if Le Chiffre is that well connected, he knows who I am and where the money's coming from. Which means he's decided to play me anyway. So, he's either desperate or he's overly confident. But, either way, that tells me something about him. And all he gets in return is a name he already has.
And now he knows something about you. He knows you're reckless.
You taste nice.
Have we dispensed with the covers?
No. We dispensed with one that was of no use and created another that is.
I figured out what that is. It's an Algerian love knot.
Really? I thought it was just something pretty.
Oh, no you didn't. Someone gave that to you. He's a very lucky man.
You think I can't take my own advice?
I think something is driving you - and I think I'll never find out what that is.
You can have me - anywhere.
I can?
Yeah. Here. There. Anyway you like.
Does this mean that you're... warming to me?
Yeah. That's how I would describe it.
It's just that not so long ago, I would have described your feelings towards me as, eh, I'm trying to think of a better word than - loathing.
I'm afraid I'm a complicated woman.
There is something to be afraid of.
They say you're judged by the strength of your enemies.
Sit down!
You're Canadian...? You work in Canadian intelligence?
That's all right... I know you do. And knowing this man, you likely have access to some very sensitive material that you're going to be forced to give up. His life will be threatened... and because you love him, you won't hesitate.
That's a beautiful necklace. Did he give it to you?
I have one just like it. He gave it to a friend of mine... someone very close to me. Your name is...?
Corinne.
Corinne... Corinne, I suggest you leave now. You contact your people, and you tell them to check their seals. They have a leak. Do it now, please. This man and I have some unfinished business.
Thank you.
Please. Make it quick.
Can I offer an opinion? I really think you people should find a better place to meet.
Ask him about Slate.
She wants to know about Slate.
Slate was a dead end.
He says it was a dead end.
Damn it! He killed him.
What are we doing?
We're teachers on sabbatical. This fits our cover.
No it doesn't. I'd rather stay at a morgue. Come on.
Hello. We're teachers on sabbatical and we've just won the lottery.
If you could avoid killing every possible lead, it would be deeply appreciated.
I'll do my best.
I've heard that before.
The Americans are gonna be none too pleased.
I promised them Le Chiffre and they got him.
They got his body.
Well, if they wanted his soul, they should have made a deal with a priest.
You killed a man in Bregenz.
I did my best not to.
You shot him at point blank and threw him off a roof. I would hardly call that showing restraint!
This is about trust. You said you weren't motivated by revenge.
I am motivated by my duty.
No... I think you're so blinded by inconsolable rage that you don't care who you hurt. When you can't tell your friends from your enemies, it's time to go.
Friend of yours?
I don't have any friends.
So, what's your interest in Greene?
Among other things, he tried to kill a friend of mine.
A woman?
Yes. But it's not what you think.
Your mother?
She likes to think so.
You know I was just wondering what South America would look like if nobody gave a damn about coke or communism. It always impressed me the way you boys would carve this place up.
I'll take that as a compliment coming from a Brit.
You can't sleep?
May I fix you a drink, Sir?
What are you drinking?
I don't know. What am I drinking?
Three measures of Gordon's Gin, One of Vodka, Half a measure of Kina...
Kina Lillet.
Kina Lillet, which is not Vermouth. Shaken well until it is ice cold and served with a large, thin slice of lemon peel. Six of them.
That's impressive.
They're good. You should have one.
You lost somebody?
I did.
You catch who ever did it?
No, not yet.
Tell me when you do, I'd like to know how it feels...
Mr. Bond, my name is Fields. I'm from the consulate.
Of course you are. And what do you do at the consulate Fields?
That's not important. My orders are to turn you around and put you on the first plane to London.
Do those orders include my friend Mathis?
I'm sorry, I don't know who you are.
You see? You've been gone for such a short time and you're already forgotten.
You're just saying that to hurt me.
Mr. Bond, these orders come from the highest possible authority.
Taxi! Fields, when is the next flight to London?
Tomorrow morning.
Well then, we have all night.
If you attempt to flee I will arrest you, drop you off at the jail and take you to the plane in chains, understand?
Perfectly. After you.
I think she has handcuffs.
I hope so.
You're late!
Got pulled into a meeting.
I bet you make it 20 miles before you consider drinking that.
Goodbye, Mr. Greene.
How much did he want?
He wanted you but I left the car as collateral. He'll get much more when he sells us out.
How long have I got?
Thirty seconds.
That doesn't give us a lot of time...
My friends call me Dominic.
I'm sure they do.
I don't think the dead care about vengeance.
Bond, I need you back.
I never left.
Are you going to tell us who you work for?
I was always very interested to meet you. I heard so much about you from Vesper. The real shame is, if she hadn't killed herself we would've had you too.
Take a deep breath, you only got one shot, make it count.
Don't bleed to death.
My sources tell me you're Bolivian Secret Service. Or, used to be. I thought you'd infiltrated Greene's organization by having sex with him.
That offends you?
No. Not the slightest.
Its time to get out.
We didn't settle on a price.
Make me an offer.
We can work it out later.
What happened to Slate?
I'm not dwelling on the past. I don't think you should either.
You killed him.
Bond, are you missing the fact that you killed a member of the Special Branch. I need you to come in.
And I would, but, right now I need to find the man who tried to kill you. Go back to sleep.
I need some information.
Oh, you have some hard friends. This man is some kind of facilitator. Fingers in many pies and they don't leave any prints.
Do you know how angry I am at myself?
I can't imagine.
You must be furious.
So, its British Intelligence now. What the hell do you want from me?
You're going to show me Dominic Greene's Tierra Project. Are you up to it?
Do I have a choice?
Do you want one?
Get in.
Are going to try and shoot me?
I said, get in.
I assume you have no regrets.
I don't! What about you?
Of course not. It would be unprofessional.
Now, you and I need to see this through.
There's no where to go. There's a capture or kill order out on you.
Who would have done that?
You and I had a mutual friend!
What else can you surmise, Mr. Bond?
About you, Miss Lynd? Well, your beauty's a problem. You worry you won't be taken seriously.
Which one can say of any attractive woman with half a brain.
True. But this one overcompensates by wearing slightly masculine clothing. Being more aggressive than her female colleagues. Which gives her a somewhat *prickly* demeanor, and ironically enough, makes it less likely for her to be accepted and promoted by her male superiors, who mistake her insecurities for arrogance. Now, I'd have normally gone with ""only child,"" but, you see, by the way you ignored the quip about your parents... I'm gonna have to go with ""orphan.""
All right... by the cut of your suit, you went to Oxford or wherever. Naturally you think human beings dress like that. But you wear it with such disdain, my guess is you didn't come from money, and your school friends never let you forget it. Which means you were at that school by the grace of someone else's charity: hence that chip on your shoulder. And since your first thought about me ran to ""orphan,"" that's what I'd say you are.
Oh, you are? I like this poker thing. And that makes perfect sense! Since MI6 looks for maladjusted young men, who give little thought to sacrificing others in order to protect Queen and country. You know... former SAS types with easy smiles and expensive watches.
Rolex?
Omega.
Beautiful. Now, having just met you, I - wouldn't go as far as calling you a cold-hearted bastard...
No, of course not.
But it wouldn't be a stretch to imagine. You think of women as disposable pleasures, rather than meaningful pursuits. So as charming as you are, Mr. Bond, I will be keeping my eye on our government's money - and off your perfectly-formed arse.
You noticed?
Even accountants have imagination. How was your lamb?
Skewered! One sympathizes.
Good evening, Mr. Bond.
Good evening, Ms. Lynd.
Vodka-martini.
Shaken or stirred?
Do I look like I give a damn?
Why is it that people who can't take advice always insist on giving it?
I'm sorry. That last hand... nearly killed me.
We've been involved for quite a long while. Hence, the shared suite.
But, my family is strict Roman Catholic. So, for appearances sake, it'll be a two bedroom suite.
I do *hate* it when religion comes between us.
Religion - and a securely locked door. Am I going to have a problem with you, Bond?
No, don't worry, you're not my type.
Smart?
Single.
Dry Martini.
Oui, monsieur.
Wait... three measures of Gordon's; one of vodka; half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake it over ice, and add a thin slice of lemon peel.
Yes, sir.
You know, I'll have one of those.
So will I.
Certainly.
My friend, bring me one as well, keep the fruit.
That's it? Hm? Anyone want to play poker now?
Someone's in a hurry.
I've got a little itch, down there. Would you mind?
Now the whole world's gonna know that you died scratching my balls!
Oh... I died? I died?
Yeah! 'Cause no matter what you do, I'm not gonna give you the password which means your clients are gonna hunt you down and cut you into little pieces of meat while you're still breathing. Because if you kill me, there'll be nowhere else to hide.
But you are SO WRONG! 'Cause even after I slaughtered you and your little girlfriend, your people would still welcome me with open arms... because they need... what I know.
The big picture.
Give me the password, and I will at least let her live.
Bond, do it soon enough and she might even be in one piece.
You *really* aren't going to tell me, are you?
No.
You love me?
Enough to travel the world with you until one of us has to take an honest job... which I think is going to have to be you, because I have no idea what an honest job is.
You can switch off so easily, can't you? It doesn't bother you? Killing those people?
Well I wouldn't be very good at my job if it did.
I think I'll call it a Vesper.
Because of the bitter aftertaste?
No, because once you've tasted it, that's all you want to drink.
You changed your shirt, Mr Bond. I hope our little game isn't causing you to perspire.
A little. But I won't consider myself to be in trouble until I start weeping blood.
The job's done and the bitch is dead.
You don't trust anyone, do you?
No.
Then you've learned your lesson.
You're not going to let me in there, are you? You've got your armour back on. That's that.
I have no armour left. You've stripped it from me. Whatever is left of me - whatever is left of me - whatever I am - I'm yours.
I'm the money.
Every penny of it.
The name's Bond... James Bond.
I can't resist waking you. Every time I do, you look at me as if you hadn't seen me in years. Makes me feel reborn.
If you had just been born, wouldn't you be naked?
I love you too M.
I always thought M was a randomly assigned initial, I had no idea it stood for...
Utter one more syllable and I'll have you killed.
I'm sorry I'm not sorry.
Stay calm and don't interrupt. Because you'll be dead within two minutes unless you do exactly what I tell you.
I'm all ears.
I knew it was too early to promote you.
Well, I understand 00s have a very short life expectancy... so your mistake will be short-lived.
I have a dinner jacket.
There are dinner jackets and dinner jackets; this is the latter. And I need you looking like a man who belongs at that table.
How?... It's tailored.
I sized you up the moment we met.
I'll kill her!
Allow me.
I should have introduced myself, seeing as we're related. Felix Leiter, a brother from Langley.
You should have faith. As long as you keep your head about you, I think you have him.
Had. Excuse me.
You're not buying in?
No.
Listen, I'm bleeding chips. I'm not going to last much longer. You have a better chance. I'll stake you. I'm saying I'll give you the money to keep going. Just one thing: you pull it off, the CIA bring him in.
What about the winnings?
Does it look like we need the money?
I'm afraid I'm a complicated woman.
That is something to be afraid of.
I would ask you if you could remain emotionally detached, but that's not your problem, is it, Bond?
No.
Oh, and the valet ticket.
M doesn't mind you earning a little money on the side, Dryden. She'd just prefer it if it wasn't selling secrets.
If the theatrics are supposed to scare me, you have the wrong man, Bond. If M was so sure that I was bent, she'd have sent a 00. Benefits of being section chief, I'd know if anyone had been promoted to 00 status, wouldn't I? Your file shows no kills, and it takes...
Two.
Shame... we barely got to know each other.
I know where you keep your gun. I suppose that's something.
True. How did he die?
Your contact? Not well.
Made you feel it, did he? Well, you needn't worry. The second is...
Yes... considerably
Hello?
Mr. White? We need to talk.
Who is this?
The name's Bond. James Bond.
Mmmmm. You like married women... don't you, James?
It keeps things simple.
What is it about bad men? You... my husband. I had so many chances to be happy, so many nice guys. Why can't nice guys be more like you?
Because then they'd be bad.
Mmmmm, yes...! But, so much more interesting.
Shame. We barely got to know each other.
I know where you keep your gun. Suppose that's something.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Now wouldn't seem an appropriate time.
Do you want a clean kill or do you want to send a message?
You know, James, I just want you to know that if all that was left of you was your smile and your little finger, you'd still be more of a man than anyone I've ever met.
That's because you know what I can do with my little finger.
I have no idea.
But you're aching to find out.
I'm Mr. Arlington Beech, professional gambler, and you're Miss Stephanie Broadchest...
I am not!
You're going to have to trust me on this.
Oh no I don't.
Stop touching your ear.
Sorry?
Put your hand down!
Vesper? I do hope you gave your parents hell for that.
You've got a bloody cheek!
Sorry. I'll shoot the camera first next time.

I'm sorry.
""Sorry?"" Sorry! Why don't you try putting that in a sentence, like maybe, ""Sorry Le Chiffre's gonna win, continue funding terror and killing innocent people!"" That kind of ""sorry""?
You lost because of your ego, and that same ego can't take it! That's what this is all about. All you're going to do now is lose more.
Well then, you're an idiot.
I'm sorry?
I said you're a bloody idiot! Look in my eyes. I can beat this man - you know that.

The job's done and the bitch is dead.
You don't trust anyone, do you?
No.
Then you've learned your lesson.
You're not going to let me in there, are you? You've got your armour back on. That's that.
I have no armour left. You've stripped it from me. Whatever is left of me - whatever is left of me - whatever I am - I'm yours.
I'm the money.
Every penny of it.
The name's Bond... James Bond.
I can't resist waking you. Every time I do, you look at me as if you hadn't seen me in years. Makes me feel reborn.
If you had just been born, wouldn't you be naked?
I love you too M.
I always thought M was a randomly assigned initial, I had no idea it stood for...
Utter one more syllable and I'll have you killed.
I'm sorry I'm not sorry.
Stay calm and don't interrupt. Because you'll be dead within two minutes unless you do exactly what I tell you.
I'm all ears.
I knew it was too early to promote you.
Well, I understand 00s have a very short life expectancy... so your mistake will be short-lived.
I have a dinner jacket.
There are dinner jackets and dinner jackets; this is the latter. And I need you looking like a man who belongs at that table.
How?... It's tailored.
I sized you up the moment we met.
I'll kill her!
Allow me.
I should have introduced myself, seeing as we're related. Felix Leiter, a brother from Langley.
You should have faith. As long as you keep your head about you, I think you have him.
Had. Excuse me.
You're not buying in?
No.
Listen, I'm bleeding chips. I'm not going to last much longer. You have a better chance. I'll stake you. I'm saying I'll give you the money to keep going. Just one thing: you pull it off, the CIA bring him in.
What about the winnings?
Does it look like we need the money?
I'm afraid I'm a complicated woman.
That is something to be afraid of.
I would ask you if you could remain emotionally detached, but that's not your problem, is it, Bond?
No.
Oh, and the valet ticket.
M doesn't mind you earning a little money on the side, Dryden. She'd just prefer it if it wasn't selling secrets.
If the theatrics are supposed to scare me, you have the wrong man, Bond. If M was so sure that I was bent, she'd have sent a 00. Benefits of being section chief, I'd know if anyone had been promoted to 00 status, wouldn't I? Your file shows no kills, and it takes...
Two.
Shame... we barely got to know each other.
I know where you keep your gun. I suppose that's something.
True. How did he die?
Your contact? Not well.
Made you feel it, did he? Well, you needn't worry. The second is...
Yes... considerably
Hello?
Mr. White? We need to talk.
Who is this?
The name's Bond. James Bond.
Mmmmm. You like married women... don't you, James?
It keeps things simple.
What is it about bad men? You... my husband. I had so many chances to be happy, so many nice guys. Why can't nice guys be more like you?
Because then they'd be bad.
Mmmmm, yes...! But, so much more interesting.
Shame. We barely got to know each other.
I know where you keep your gun. Suppose that's something.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Now wouldn't seem an appropriate time.
Do you want a clean kill or do you want to send a message?
You know, James, I just want you to know that if all that was left of you was your smile and your little finger, you'd still be more of a man than anyone I've ever met.
That's because you know what I can do with my little finger.
I have no idea.
But you're aching to find out.
I'm Mr. Arlington Beech, professional gambler, and you're Miss Stephanie Broadchest...
I am not!
You're going to have to trust me on this.
Oh no I don't.
Stop touching your ear.
Sorry?
Put your hand down!
Vesper? I do hope you gave your parents hell for that.
You've got a bloody cheek!
Sorry. I'll shoot the camera first next time.
Or yourself. You stormed into an Embassy. You violated the only absolutely inviolate rule of international relations, and why? So you could kill a nobody. We wanted to question him, not to kill him! For God's sake! You're supposed to display some kind of judgement.
I did. I thought one less bomb maker in the world would be a good thing.
Exactly. One bomb maker. We're trying to figure out how an entire network of terrorist groups is financed and you give us one bomb maker. Hardly the big picture, wouldn't you say?
You OK?
Me?
Thank you.
You're welcome. Now get yourself off to a hospital.
I will do. As soon as I've won this game.
You're not seriously going back there?
I wouldn't dream of it.
Well, I'm gonna need the other five million to buy back in.
I can't do that, James.
Look, I made a mistake. I was impatient, maybe I was arrogant, but I can beat him.
I'm sorry.
""Sorry?"" Sorry! Why don't you try putting that in a sentence, like maybe, ""Sorry Le Chiffre's gonna win, continue funding terror and killing innocent people!"" That kind of ""sorry""?
You lost because of your ego, and that same ego can't take it! That's what this is all about. All you're going to do now is lose more.
Well then, you're an idiot.
I'm sorry?
I said you're a bloody idiot! Look in my eyes. I can beat this man - you know that.
Get your hand off my arm.
Looks like our man, burn scars on his face.
Hmm. I wonder if bomb-makers are insured for things like that.
So you want me to be half-monk, half-hitman.
Any thug can kill. I need you to take your ego out of the equation.
What makes your husband a bad man?
His nature, I suppose.
The nature of his work?
The mystery, I'm afraid. I'm also afraid you will sleep with me in order to get to him.
How afraid?
Oh, not enough to stop.
Apparently, he's on the last flight to Miami. So, you have all night to question me.
In that case, we're gonna need - some more champagne.
Good evening. Can I get a bottle of chilled Bollinger Grande Année and the Beluga caviar?
Benefits of being section chief. I'd know if anyone had been promoted to 00 status, wouldn't I? Your file shows no kills, and it takes...
Two.
It was worth it to discover his ""tell"".
What'd you mean ""tell""?
The twitch he has to hide when he bluffs.
Bluffs? He had the best hand.
He won the hand with the river card. The odds against are twenty-three to one, and he'd know that. When he made his first raise, he had nothing. Winning was blind luck.
Could you do me a favor? I was here for dinner last night and I parked my car next to a very beautiful 1964 Aston Martin - and I'm ashamed to say I nicked the door. You wouldn't happen to know...
Mr. Dimitrios.
Right.
If he hasn't noticed, I'm not sure I'd mention it. He isn't the type to take bad news well.
You can stop pretending. You knew I wouldn't let this drop, didn't you?
Well, I knew you were you.
You want to do what to me?
You've lost me, completely.
You said you can't wait to get me back to the room, come on.
Can I give you a lift home?
That would really send him over the edge. I'm afraid I'm not that corrupt.
Well, perhaps you're just out of practice.
What about a drink at my place?
Your place? Is it close?
Very.
One drink.
She was tortured first. As you'd already killed her husband, she must have been the only one left to question. Did she know anything that could compromise you?
No.
Not your name? What you were after?
No.
So you're telling me its a matter of probability and chance. I was worried there wasn't chance involved.
Well, usually the player with the best hand wins.
So, that would be what you call bluffing.
You've heard the term. Then you also know in poker you never play your hand. You play the man across from you.
And you're good at reading people?
Yes, I am. Which is why I've been able to detect an undercurrent of sarcasm in your voice.
You don't think this is a very good plan, do you?
So there is a plan? I got the impression we were risking millions of dollars and hundreds of lives on a game of luck.
Look, if Le Chiffre is that well connected, he knows who I am and where the money's coming from. Which means he's decided to play me anyway. So, he's either desperate or he's overly confident. But, either way, that tells me something about him. And all he gets in return is a name he already has.
And now he knows something about you. He knows you're reckless.
You taste nice.
Have we dispensed with the covers?
No. We dispensed with one that was of no use and created another that is.
I figured out what that is. It's an Algerian love knot.
Really? I thought it was just something pretty.
Oh, no you didn't. Someone gave that to you. He's a very lucky man.
You think I can't take my own advice?
I think something is driving you - and I think I'll never find out what that is.
You can have me - anywhere.
I can?
Yeah. Here. There. Anyway you like.
Does this mean that you're... warming to me?
Yeah. That's how I would describe it.
It's just that not so long ago, I would have described your feelings towards me as, eh, I'm trying to think of a better word than - loathing.
I'm afraid I'm a complicated woman.
There is something to be afraid of.
What else can you surmise, Mr. Bond?
About you, Miss Lynd? Well, your beauty's a problem. You worry you won't be taken seriously.
Which one can say of any attractive woman with half a brain.
True. But this one overcompensates by wearing slightly masculine clothing. Being more aggressive than her female colleagues. Which gives her a somewhat *prickly* demeanor, and ironically enough, makes it less likely for her to be accepted and promoted by her male superiors, who mistake her insecurities for arrogance. Now, I'd have normally gone with ""only child,"" but, you see, by the way you ignored the quip about your parents... I'm gonna have to go with ""orphan.""
All right... by the cut of your suit, you went to Oxford or wherever. Naturally you think human beings dress like that. But you wear it with such disdain, my guess is you didn't come from money, and your school friends never let you forget it. Which means you were at that school by the grace of someone else's charity: hence that chip on your shoulder. And since your first thought about me ran to ""orphan,"" that's what I'd say you are.
Oh, you are? I like this poker thing. And that makes perfect sense! Since MI6 looks for maladjusted young men, who give little thought to sacrificing others in order to protect Queen and country. You know... former SAS types with easy smiles and expensive watches.
Rolex?
Omega.
Beautiful. Now, having just met you, I - wouldn't go as far as calling you a cold-hearted bastard...
No, of course not.
But it wouldn't be a stretch to imagine. You think of women as disposable pleasures, rather than meaningful pursuits. So as charming as you are, Mr. Bond, I will be keeping my eye on our government's money - and off your perfectly-formed arse.
You noticed?
Even accountants have imagination. How was your lamb?
Skewered! One sympathizes.
Good evening, Mr. Bond.
Good evening, Ms. Lynd.
Vodka-martini.
Shaken or stirred?
Do I look like I give a damn?
Why is it that people who can't take advice always insist on giving it?
I'm sorry. That last hand... nearly killed me.
We've been involved for quite a long while. Hence, the shared suite.
But, my family is strict Roman Catholic. So, for appearances sake, it'll be a two bedroom suite.
I do *hate* it when religion comes between us.
Religion - and a securely locked door. Am I going to have a problem with you, Bond?
No, don't worry, you're not my type.
Smart?
Single.
Dry Martini.
Oui, monsieur.
Wait... three measures of Gordon's; one of vodka; half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake it over ice, and add a thin slice of lemon peel.
Yes, sir.
You know, I'll have one of those.
So will I.
Certainly.
My friend, bring me one as well, keep the fruit.
That's it? Hm? Anyone want to play poker now?
Someone's in a hurry.
I've got a little itch, down there. Would you mind?
Now the whole world's gonna know that you died scratching my balls!
Oh... I died? I died?
Yeah! 'Cause no matter what you do, I'm not gonna give you the password which means your clients are gonna hunt you down and cut you into little pieces of meat while you're still breathing. Because if you kill me, there'll be nowhere else to hide.
But you are SO WRONG! 'Cause even after I slaughtered you and your little girlfriend, your people would still welcome me with open arms... because they need... what I know.
The big picture.
Give me the password, and I will at least let her live.
Bond, do it soon enough and she might even be in one piece.
You *really* aren't going to tell me, are you?
No.
You love me?
Enough to travel the world with you until one of us has to take an honest job... which I think is going to have to be you, because I have no idea what an honest job is.
You can switch off so easily, can't you? It doesn't bother you? Killing those people?
Well I wouldn't be very good at my job if it did.
I think I'll call it a Vesper.
Because of the bitter aftertaste?
No, because once you've tasted it, that's all you want to drink.
You changed your shirt, Mr Bond. I hope our little game isn't causing you to perspire.
A little. But I won't consider myself to be in trouble until I start weeping blood.
The job's done and the bitch is dead.
You don't trust anyone, do you?

Everett Hitch,V,Cultured Badass,"I'm sorry, Virgil.
Stay here, Everett.
I'm sorry. I was so alone, and Bragg... Well, Ring protected me and so did his brother.
You fuck Mackie, too?
No. It was Ring. He was in charge. I just did what I had to do.
Everett... Ring kills me, do you think she'll go off with him?
I think Allie needs to be with a man.
You're a bastard! Don't listen to him. He tried to put his hands on me when I showed him our house.
No, Virgil. I did not.
No, Allie. Everett didn't do that.
You believe him over me?
That's correct.
Like my father, I'd been West Point, and I was good at soldiering. But soldiering didn't allow for much expansion of the soul. So after the War Between the States and a year of fighting Indians, I turned in my commission and rode away to see how much I could expand it. First time I met Virgil Cole was when I and my eight-gauge backed him up in a showdown he was having with some drunken mountain men. Virgil asked me right there on the spot if I'd care to partner up with him and his peacekeeping business. Which is why I was with him now, and why I still carry the eight-gauge. We'd been keeping the peace together for the last dozen years or so. And as we looked down on a town called Appaloosa, I had no reason to doubt we'd be doing just that for the foreseeable future.
But life has a way of making the foreseeable that which never happens, and the unforeseeable that which your life becomes.
That was quick.
Yeah, everybody could shoot.
I figured I'd saved Virgil's career as a lawman and given him another chance with Allie. At least for the foreseeable future. As for the unforeseeable, well, it was out there waiting for me. I headed straight into the setting sun and rode west at an easy pace. It was gonna be a long ride, and there was no reason to hurry.
You calling Virgil crazy?
Yes. No. Uh...
Well, if you think a man makes a living as a gun-hand isn't crazy...
*You're* not crazy.
Maybe, maybe not. Whatever I am, I'm not Virgil Cole.
Well, Dean, go back to Mr. Bragg and report that we ain't too frightened.
Mr. Bragg ain't gonna like that you hit me.
I don't guess you liked it all that much yourself, Dean.
You're damn right.
So you and Mr. Bragg can commi... What word am I trying for?
""Commiserate?""
You and Mr. Bragg can commiserate each other.
Virgil always tells the truth.
Oh, nobody *always* tells the truth.
Why not?
Well, they... For heaven's sake, Virgil, they just don't.
Always thought the truth was simpler. Tell a man what you mean.
And a woman?
A woman?
That's what I said.
Well, Allie, I don't really remember ever telling a woman anything.
Virgil Cole...
What?
Are you telling me that you've never had a woman?
Well, hell, Allie, I don't think that's something I should be discussing with you.
But have you?
Well, of course I have.
And did you never tell them anything?
Mostly, we just did what we were there to do.
Which was what?
We won't talk about this anymore.
Oh, Virgil. I was just funning you.
I didn't enjoy it.
Tell her she can pick whichever one she likes. You know, I'm kind of partial to this one here, but look. Look at that. You can see right through it.
Kind of small for curtains, aren't they?
Everett, we've been together now a while. Can't exactly say how long, but long. Ain't anybody I'd rather do this work with. You're as good as anybody I've seen, except maybe the Shelton boys and me. The reason you ain't as good as the Sheltons or me ain't got nothing to do with steady or fast or fortuitous. The reason the above-named folks are better than you is because you got feelings.
Well, hell, Virgil, everybody's got feelings.
Feelings get you killed.
You got feelings about Allie, don't you?
I cared about Allie in town, and I'll care about her when I get her back. But right now there's something running, and we're trying to catch it.
I never met a woman like her. Mostly I've been with whores and that squaw lady I told you about. She speaks well and dresses fine, and she's good-looking. She can play the piano, and she cooks good, and she's very clean. Chews her food nice. But it appears she'll fuck anything ain't gelded.
I'm not certain that's quite right.
What do you think's right?
I think she wants to be with the boss stallion.
There's only one stallion in a herd.
At a time.
I am mortified that you saw me with no clothes on.
Oh, Allie, it was an incomparable pleasure.
I ever ask you for anything? Well, I'm asking you now. Just leave it alone.
Just once, Virgil. One favor."
Leopold,V,Cultured Badass,"She was a real romantic, my mom. When, when Prince Charles and Lady Di got married, she had a party, she made crumpets and jam. It was like a Super Bowl party, but for moms. She cried for a week.
I don't know the story of Prince Charles and Lady Di.
Oh, you don't want to. It's a cautionary tale, further proof.
Of what?
You can't live a fairy tale.
Ah Miss Blaine, you dance like a herd of cattle. You are a rare woman who lights up a room simply by leaving it!
People might think I'm brave, but I'm not.
""The brave are simply those with the clearest vision of what is before them - glory and danger alike - and, notwithstanding, go out to meet it.""
Well, let us proceed. Please raise your glasses so we may toast to my bride-to-be, the woman whose welfare and happiness shall be my solemn duty to maintain. The future Duchess of Albany...
Kate McKay. Of the McKays of...?
Massapequa.
Massapequa.
I love you.
I love you.
Don't you think it's time you told me who you are. I mean, don't get me wrong, doing the Duke thing with you 24/7 is a blast, but really. Who are you?
I'm the man that loves your sister.
I'm not very good with men.
Perhaps you haven't found the right one.
Maybe. Or, uh... maybe that whole love thing is just a grown-up version of Santa Claus; just a myth we've been fed since childhood. So, we keep buying magazines, joining clubs, and doing therapy and watching movies with hit pop songs played over love montages all in a pathetic attempt to explain why our love Santa keeps getting caught in the chimney.
And you push this button. Word to the wise: don't press that till she wakes up, so she sees you doing it.
How clever. The proverbial tree in the woods.
If a man washes a dish, and no one sees it...

did it happen?
Right.
Some feel that to court a woman in one's employ is nothing more than a serpentine effort to transform a lady into a whore.
It has always been your greatest misfortune, nephew, that you so thoroughly amuse yourself with the sound of your own voice.
In a life as stagnant as mine, that I can amuse myself at all is an evolutionary miracle.
Good Lord, it still stands. The world has changed all around it, but Roebling's erection still stands! Ha, ha!
That, my friend, is a miracle!
What?
It's a miracle, man!
It's a bridge.
Otis always told me love is a leap. Lamentably, I was never inspired to jump.
Why are you standing?
I am accustomed to stand when a lady leaves the table.
Dearest Katherine... I behaved as an imbecile last night,I animated in part by drink, in part by your beauty,and in part by my own foolish pride and for that I am profoundly sorry. Please accept as a gesture of apology, a private dinner on the roof top tonight at 8 O'Clock .
By the way. There is no ""Andre"" in Boheme. It's Rodolfo. And though it takes place in France, it is rarely played in French as it is written in Italian. Goodnight, Kate.
I warn you scoundrel, I was trained at the King's Academy and schooled in weaponry by the palace guard. You stand no chance. When you run, I shall ride, when you stop, the steel of this strap shall be lodged in your brain.
That thing is a damned hazard!
It's just a toaster!
Well, insertion of bread into that so-called toaster produces no toast at all, merely warm bread! Inserting the bread twice produces charcoal. So, clearly, to make proper toast it requires one and a half insertions, which is something for which the apparatus doesn't begin to allow! One assumes that when the General of Electric built it, he might have tried using it. One assumes the General might take pride in his creations instead of just foisting them on an unsuspecting public.
You know something? Nobody gives a rat's ass that you have to push the toast down twice. You know why? Because everybody pushes their toast down twice!
Not where I come from.
Oh, right. Where you come from, toast is the result of reflection and study!
Ah yes, you mock me. But perhaps one day when you've awoken from a pleasant slumber to the scent of a warm brioche smothered in marmalade and fresh creamery butter, you'll understand that life is not solely composed of tasks, but tastes.
Say that again.
Where I come from the meal is the result of reflection and study. Menus are prepared in advance, timed to perfection. It is said that without the culinary arts, the crudeness of reality would be unbearable.
Marriage is the promise of eternal love. As a man of honor I cannot promise eternally what I've never felt momentarily.
You of all people should understand, you're a scientist. I mean, you invented the elevator.
What is an elevator? What are you talking... Where the hell am I?
I told you, you haven't actually gone anywhere, you're still in New York.
That sir, is not New York!
I'm afraid it is!
Is it your habit sir, to simply enter a conversation without introduction?
And I would have gotten her number if you hadn't turned the evening into a guided tour of the Louvre!
My apologies.
Let's get one thing straight. Patrice, she thought you were cute - probably gay, and cute - and cute, Leo, that's just the kiss of death.
Perhaps.
Perhaps? Certainly!
I believe this is her number.
As I see it, Patrice has not an inkling of your affections, and it's no wonder. You, Charles, are a merry-andrew.
A what?
Everything plays a farce to you. Women respond to sincerity. No-one wants to be romanced by a buffoon. Now, that number rings her.
Yes?
So ring her tomorrow.
I can't. She gave the number to you.
Only because I told her of your affections.
Wha - what did you say?
Merely that you admired her, but you were hesitant to make an overture, as you'd been told she was courting another.
Shit... that's good! Well, what did she say?
She handed me the napkin.
Charles, it's quite late.
No, no, she won't be home yet. I get her machine and leave a message, ball's in her court.
You're ladling calculation upon comedy. The point is, to keep the ball in *your* court.
You're right! You're right!
You're tucking me in.
Yes.
You're my Otis.
Yes, Your Grace.
You require a chaperone. His intentions are obvious.
I'm alone with you, do I need a chaperone?
We are not courting, Kate. If we were, as a man of honour, I would have informed you of my intentions in writing.
Are you suggesting madam that there exists a law compelling a gentleman to lay hold of canine bowel movements?
I'm suggesting that you pick the poop up.
Are you for real?
I believe so.
I feel as though we've met on a previous occasion.
Well Lionel, seeing as how I've never met any of Stuart's friends, not even sure he has any, I don't think that's possible.
Look, this is not complex. He gave me the Palm Pilot, he just forgot the pointy thing.
I've been warned about you.
Oh. And what, pray tell, did the great disappointment say?
What has happened to the world? You have every convenience and comfort, yet no time for integrity.
He started squirting everybody with this turkey baster and screaming ""Un-sex me! Un-sex me!""
Wasn't Willem Dafoe in that group?
Yeah, and he went on to talk about how a lot of secrets are hidden in people's basements...
Like the Louvre?
I'm sorry, Charles, you were saying?
What about the Louvre?
Yeah, tell us what you were going to say.
Well, not all of the artwork in the Louvre is on the walls. Some is in the basement.
You've been in the basement of the Louvre?
Why, yes!
I was a art history major at Vassar!
Ahhhh...
You're intoxicated. We should retire.
Can you go away? Can you just go away? Can you go away?
Im sorry if I have offended you in anyway..."
Hannibal Lecter,"V, N","Cultured Badass, Charmer","A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti.
I do wish we could chat longer, but... I'm having an old friend for dinner. Bye.
Dr. Lecter?... Dr. Lecter?... Dr. Lecter?... Dr. Lecter?...
Well, Clarice - have the lambs stopped screaming?
First principles, Clarice. Simplicity. Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each particular thing ask: what is it in itself? What is its nature? What does he do, this man you seek?
He kills women...
No. That is incidental. What is the first and principal thing he does? What needs does he serve by killing?
Anger, um, social acceptance, and, huh, sexual frustrations, sir...
No! He covets. That is his nature. And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? Do we seek out things to covet? Make an effort to answer now.
No. We just...
No. We begin by coveting what we see every day. Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice? And don't your eyes seek out the things you want?
Tell me, Senator: did you nurse Catherine yourself?
What?
Did you breast-feed her?
Now wait a minute...
Yes, I did.
Toughened your nipples, didn't it?
You son of a bitch!
Amputate a man's leg and he can still feel it tickling. Tell me, mum, when your little girl is on the slab, where will it tickle you?
Take this... *thing* back to Baltimore!
Five foot ten, strongly built, about a hundred and eighty pounds; hair blonde, eyes pale blue. He'd be about thirty-five now. He said he lived in Philadelphia, but he may have lied. That's all I can remember, mum, but if I think of any more, I will let you know. Oh, and Senator, just one more thing: love your suit!
No!
I will listen now. After your father's murder, you were orphaned. You were ten years old. You went to live with cousins on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And...?
And one morning, I just ran away.
No ""just"", Clarice. What set you off? You started at what time?
Early, still dark.
Then something woke you, didn't it? Was it a dream? What was it?
I heard a strange noise.
What was it?
It was... screaming. Some kind of screaming, like a child's voice.
What did you do?
I went downstairs, outside. I crept up into the barn. I was so scared to look inside, but I had to.
And what did you see, Clarice? What did you see?
Lambs. The lambs were screaming.
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?
And they were screaming.
And you ran away?
No. First I tried to free them. I... I opened the gate to their pen, but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run.
But you could and you did, didn't you?
Yes. I took one lamb, and I ran away as fast as I could.
Where were you going, Clarice?
I don't know. I didn't have any food, any water and it was very cold, very cold. I thought, I thought if I could save just one, but... he was so heavy. So heavy. I didn't get more than a few miles when the sheriff's car picked me up. The rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman. I never saw the ranch again.
What became of your lamb, Clarice?
They killed him.
You know what you look like to me, with your good bag and your cheap shoes? You look like a rube. A well scrubbed, hustling rube with a little taste. Good nutrition's given you some length of bone, but you're not more than one generation from poor white trash, are you, Agent Starling? And that accent you've tried so desperately to shed: pure West Virginia. What is your father, dear? Is he a coal miner? Does he stink of the lamp? You know how quickly the boys found you... all those tedious sticky fumblings in the back seats of cars... while you could only dream of getting out... getting anywhere... getting all the way to the FBI.
You see a lot, Doctor. But are you strong enough to point that high-powered perception at yourself? What about it? Why don't you - why don't you look at yourself and write down what you see? Or maybe you're afraid to.
Where are you, Dr. Lecter?
I've no plans to call on you, Clarice. The world is more interesting with you in it.
Why do you think he removes their skins, Agent Starling?
Enthrall me with your acumen.
It excites him. Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies from their victims.
I didn't.
No. No, you ate yours.
Look for severe childhood disturbances associated with violence. Our Billy wasn't born a criminal, Clarice. He was made one through years of systematic abuse. Billy hates his own identity, you see, and he thinks that makes him a transsexual. But his pathology is a thousand times more savage and more terrifying.
You still wake up sometimes, don't you? You wake up in the dark and hear the screaming of the lambs.
Yes.
And you think if you save poor Catherine, you could make them stop, don't you? You think if Catherine lives, you won't wake up in the dark ever again to that awful screaming of the lambs.
I don't know. I don't know.
Thank you, Clarice. Thank you.
Tell me his name, Doctor.
Dr. Chilton, I presume. I think you know each other.
Okay. Let's go.
It's your turn, Doctor.
Out!
Tell me his name!
I'm sorry, ma'am. We've got orders. We have to put you on a plane. Come on, now.
Brave Clarice. You will let me know when those lambs stop screaming, won't you?
Tell me his name, Doctor!
Clarice, your case file. Goodbye, Clarice.
You're very frank, Clarice. I think it would be quite something to know you in private life.
Did you do all these drawings, Doctor?
Ah. That is the Duomo seen from the Belvedere. Do you know Florence?
All that detail just from memory, sir?
Memory, Agent Starling, is what I have instead of a view.
Jack Crawford is helping your career isn't he? Apparently he likes you and you like him too.
I never thought about it.
Do you think that Jack Crawford wants you sexually? True, he is much older but do you think he visualizes scenarios, exchanges, fucking you?
That doesn't interest me Doctor and frankly, it's, it's the sort of thing that Miggs would say.
Not anymore.
People will say we're in love.
Now then, tell me. What did Miggs say to you? Multiple Miggs in the next cell. He hissed at you. What did he say?
He said, ""I can smell your cunt.""
I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today.
If you didn't kill him, then who did, sir?
Who can say. Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere.
""Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center."" Sounds charming.
That's only a part of the island. There's a very, very nice beach. Terns nest there. There's beautiful...
Terns? Mmh. If I help you, Clarice, it will be ""turns"" with us too. Quid pro quo. I tell you things, you tell me things. Not about this case, though. About yourself. Quid pro quo. Yes or no?
Yes or no, Clarice? Poor little Catherine is waiting.
Go, doctor.
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.
Closer, please. Clo-ser...
All good things to those who wait.
There are three major centers for transsexual surgery - Johns Hopkins, University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical Center.
Advancement, of course. Listen carefully. Look deep within yourself, Clarice Starling. Go seek out Miss Mofet, an old patient of mine. M-o-f-e-t. Go now, I don't think Miggs could manage again quite so soon, even though he is crazy.
Go now!
Good evening, Clarice.
You fly back to school, now, little Starling. Fly, fly, fly...
The wig, the dress, the makeup. Raspail was a transvestite?
In life? Oh, no. Garden-variety Manic Depressive. Tedious, very tedious. I did not kill him I assure you just tucked him away, very much as I found him, after he'd missed three appointments.
If you didn't kill him, who did?
Who can say? Best thing for him, really, his therapy was going nowhere. No, just think of him as a fledgling killer's first attempt at transformation.
What do you mean fledgling killer? Do you mean he's killed again?
I've been in this room for eight years, now Clarice, and I know they'll never let me out, not while I'm alive. What I want is a view where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution far away from Doctor Chiltern. I'll help you catch him, Clarice.
You know who he is, don't you? Tell me who decapitated your patient.
All good things to those who wait. I've waited, but how long can you and Jackie-boy wait? Our little Billy must already be looking for that next special someone.
That is very slippery of you, Agent Starling.
Thank you, Barney.
Where are your drawings?
Punishment, you see, for Miggs. Like that Gospel Programme. When you're gone they'll turn the volume way up. Doctor Chiltern does enjoy his petty torments.
I would not have had that happen to you, discourtesy is unspeakably ugly to me.
There's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive.
...Billy is not a real transsexual. There are three major centers for transsexual surgery... I wouldn't be surprised if Billy had applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them and been rejected... Billy hates his own identity you see, and he thinks that makes him a transsexual.

Ghost Dog,"V, AQ","Cultured Badass, Hitman With A Heart","There is something to be learned from a rainstorm. When meeting with a sudden shower, you try not to get wet and run quickly along the road. But doing such things as passing under the eaves of houses, you still get wet. When you are resolved from the beginning, you will not be perplexed, though you still get the same soaking. This understanding extends to everything.
There is surely nothing other than the single purpose of the moment. A man's whole life is a succession of moment after moment. If one fully understands the present moment, there is nothing left to do, and nothing else to pursue.
It is a good viewpoint to see the world as a dream. When you have something like a nightmare, you will wake up and tell yourself that it was only a dream. It is said that the world we live in is not a bit different from this.
You know, in ancient cultures, bears were considered equal with men.
This ain't no ancient culture here, mister.
Sometimes it is.
The Way of the Samurai is found in death. Meditation on inevitable death should be performed daily. Every day when one's body and mind are at peace, one should meditate upon being ripped apart by arrows, rifles, spears, and swords. Being carried away by surging waves. Being thrown into the midst of a great fire. Being struck by lightning, being shaken to death by a great earthquake. Falling from thousand-foot cliffs, dying of disease, or committing seppuku at the death of one's master. And every day, without fail, one should consider himself as dead. This is the substance of the Way of the Samurai.
Among the maxims on Lord Naoshige's wall, there was this one: ""Matters of great concern should be treated lightly."" Master Ittei commented, ""Matters of small concern should be treated seriously.""
Can't you understand what he's saying?
No, I don't understand him. I don't speak French, only English. I never understand a word he says.
And that's your best friend?
Yeah.
In the words of the ancients, one should make his decision within the space of seven breaths. It is a matter of being determined and having the spirit to break through to the other side.
Our bodies are given life from the midst of nothingness. Existing where there is nothing is the meaning of the phrase ""Form is emptiness."" That all things are provided for by nothingness is the meaning of the phrase ""Emptiness is form."" One should not think that these are two separate things.
Goddamn it. You shot me in the exact same fucking place as last time!
I'm sorry. I mean you no disrespect. You're my retainer. I don't want to put too many holes in you.
It is said that what is called the Spirit of an Age is something to which one cannot return. That this spirit gradually dissipates is due to the world's coming to an end. In the same way, a single year does not have just spring or summer. A single day, too, is the same. For this reason, although one would like to change today's world back to the spirit of one hundred years or more ago, it cannot be done. Thus it is important to make the best out of every generation.
According to what one of the elders said, taking an enemy on the battlefield is like a hawk taking a bird. Even though it enters into the midst of a thousand of them, it gives no attention to any bird than the one it first marked.
Even if one's head were to be suddenly cut off, he should be able to do one more action with certainty. With martial valor, if one becomes like a revengeful ghost and shows great determination, though his head is cut off, he should not die.
When one has made a decision to kill a person, even if it will be very difficult to succeed by advancing straight ahead, it will not do to think about doing it in a long, roundabout way. One's heart may slacken, he may miss his chance, and by and large there will be no success. The Way of the Samurai is one of immediacy, and it is best to dash in headlong.
Ghost Dog, power, equality.
Always see everything, my brother.
It is bad when one thing becomes two. One should not look for anything else in the Way of the Samurai. It is the same for anything that is called a Way. If one understands things in this manner, he should be able to hear about all ways and be more and more in accord with his own.
If one were to say in a word what the condition of being a samurai is, its basis lies first in seriously devoting one's body and soul to his master.
Jesus Christ. You just shot Morini. He was Valerio's fucking brother-in-law.
He had a gun. He was going to shoot you.
What?
See if he's dead.
Well, I don't think he's getting any older.
Everything around us seems to be changing, huh, Louie?
You can say that again.
Night Nurse? You actually read that?
No. I just like the cover.

This ain't no ancient culture here, mister.
Sometimes it is.
The Way of the Samurai is found in death. Meditation on inevitable death should be performed daily. Every day when one's body and mind are at peace, one should meditate upon being ripped apart by arrows, rifles, spears, and swords. Being carried away by surging waves. Being thrown into the midst of a great fire. Being struck by lightning, being shaken to death by a great earthquake. Falling from thousand-foot cliffs, dying of disease, or committing seppuku at the death of one's master. And every day, without fail, one should consider himself as dead. This is the substance of the Way of the Samurai.
Among the maxims on Lord Naoshige's wall, there was this one: ""Matters of great concern should be treated lightly."" Master Ittei commented, ""Matters of small concern should be treated seriously.""
Can't you understand what he's saying?
No, I don't understand him. I don't speak French, only English. I never understand a word he says.
And that's your best friend?
Yeah.
In the words of the ancients, one should make his decision within the space of seven breaths. It is a matter of being determined and having the spirit to break through to the other side.
Our bodies are given life from the midst of nothingness. Existing where there is nothing is the meaning of the phrase ""Form is emptiness."" That all things are provided for by nothingness is the meaning of the phrase ""Emptiness is form."" One should not think that these are two separate things.
Goddamn it. You shot me in the exact same fucking place as last time!
I'm sorry. I mean you no disrespect. You're my retainer. I don't want to put too many holes in you.
It is said that what is called the Spirit of an Age is something to which one cannot return. That this spirit gradually dissipates is due to the world's coming to an end. In the same way, a single year does not have just spring or summer. A single day, too, is the same. For this reason, although one would like to change today's world back to the spirit of one hundred years or more ago, it cannot be done. Thus it is important to make the best out of every generation.
According to what one of the elders said, taking an enemy on the battlefield is like a hawk taking a bird. Even though it enters into the midst of a thousand of them, it gives no attention to any bird than the one it first marked.
Even if one's head were to be suddenly cut off, he should be able to do one more action with certainty. With martial valor, if one becomes like a revengeful ghost and shows great determination, though his head is cut off, he should not die.
When one has made a decision to kill a person, even if it will be very difficult to succeed by advancing straight ahead, it will not do to think about doing it in a long, roundabout way. One's heart may slacken, he may miss his chance, and by and large there will be no success. The Way of the Samurai is one of immediacy, and it is best to dash in headlong.
Ghost Dog, power, equality.
Always see everything, my brother.
It is bad when one thing becomes two. One should not look for anything else in the Way of the Samurai. It is the same for anything that is called a Way. If one understands things in this manner, he should be able to hear about all ways and be more and more in accord with his own.
If one were to say in a word what the condition of being a samurai is, its basis lies first in seriously devoting one's body and soul to his master.
Jesus Christ. You just shot Morini. He was Valerio's fucking brother-in-law.
He had a gun. He was going to shoot you.
What?
See if he's dead.
Well, I don't think he's getting any older.
Everything around us seems to be changing, huh, Louie?
You can say that again.
Night Nurse? You actually read that?
No. I just like the cover."
Dupont,V,Cultured Badass,"Be careful Preston. You're treading on my dreams.
Wait! Wait! Look at me. Look at me. I'm life. I live... I, I breathe... I feel. Now that you know it... can you really take it? Is it really worth the price?
I pay it gladly.
And you, Preston, the supposed savior of the resistance, are now its destroyer, and, along with them, you've given me yourself... calmly... coolly... entirely without incident.
No.
Oh... Shit.
Not without incident.
You really should learn to knock.
The gun katas. Through analysis of thousands of recorded gunfights, the Cleric has determined that the geometric distribution of antagonists in any gun battle is a statistically predictable element. The gun kata treats the gun as a total weapon, each fluid position representing a maximum kill zone, inflicting maximum damage on the maximum number of opponents while keeping the defender clear of the statistically traditional trajectories of return fire. By the rote mastery of this art, your firing efficiency will rise by no less than 120%. The difference of a 63% increase to lethal proficiency makes the master of the gun katas an adversary not to be taken lightly.
In the first years of the 21st century, a third World War broke out. Those of us who survived knew mankind could never survive a fourth; that our own volatile natures could simply no longer be risked. So we have created a new arm of the law: The Grammaton Cleric, whose sole task it is to seek out and eradicate the true source of man's inhumanity to man - his ability to feel.
It is not the will of the Council, it is the will of Father and he is law.
Sir... without the logic of process, is it not just mayhem - what we have worked so hard to eradicate?
You must understand, Preston, that while you - and even I - may not always agree with it,it is not the message that is important, it is our obedience to it. Father's will. Call it faith. You have it, I assume?
Yes. I have it.
Good.
You're absolutely 100% right, sir.
Of course I am."

Life is very sweet, brother, who would wish to die?
Ah.
George Borrow, I believe. A worthy writer, and a beautiful sentiment sir. But you're not my brother.

Good lord no. We're a family.

Hey, Jacko, you lazy bugger, I told you to bury that bastard last night. He stinks worse than you. Jacko!
You got the wrong fuckin' black man.
Slowly now, Sergeant. Put your privates back in your pants and turn around. Come to steal my brother a horse, and we find ourselves a copper.
You fire that gun, you'll have eight more all over you.
Fair enough.
Step into the shade, Sergeant. To the back.
Has Charlie found you, then? Stanley's little mate.
Over there, by the straw. That's right. Stay. Lay down, Sergeant.
I know something you don't know. Your brother's come to kill you. I can help.
You can help me? Help your fucking self!

Why can't you ever just... stop me?
You got me, Charlie. What are you going to do now?

Sol,BL,Stupid Crooks,"You're always gonna have problems lifting a body in one piece. Apparently the best thing to do is cut up a corpse into six pieces and pile it all together.
Would someone mind telling me, who are you?
And when you got your six pieces, you gotta get rid of them, because it's no good leaving it in the deep freeze for your mum to discover, now is it? Then I hear the best thing to do is feed them to pigs. You got to starve the pigs for a few days, then the sight of a chopped-up body will look like curry to a pisshead. You gotta shave the heads of your victims, and pull the teeth out for the sake of the piggies' digestion. You could do this afterwards, of course, but you don't want to go sievin' through pig shit, now do you? They will go through bone like butter. You need at least sixteen pigs to finish the job in one sitting, so be wary of any man who keeps a pig farm. They will go through a body that weighs 200 pounds in about eight minutes. That means that a single pig can consume two pounds of uncooked flesh every minute. Hence the expression, ""as greedy as a pig"".
Well, thank you for that. That's a great weight off me mind. Now, if you wouldn't mind telling me who the fuck you are, apart from someone who feeds people to pigs of course?
He's a natural, ain't you Tyrone?
'course I am...
A natural fucking idiot.
Did he have four fingers?
I'm sorry, I couldn't get the bin-noc-u-lars out in time.
What the fuck do you mean, replicas?
They look the shit, don't they? And nobody is gonna argue. And I've got some extra loud blanks, just in case.
In... Oh, in case we have to deafen them to death?
I'm not in here to make a fucking bet.
'Preciated, but all... bets... are... off. If all bets are off, then there can't be any money can't there?
I'm not fucking buying that.
Well that's handy, 'cause I ain't fucking selling it. It's a fact.
You ain't from this planet are you, Vincent? Who is gonna mug two black fellas, holding pistols, sat in a car that is worth less than your shirt?
What the fuck is that?
Heh heh. This is a shotgun, Sol.
It's a fucking anti-aircraft gun, Vincent.
Well I wanna raise some pulses, don't I?
You'll raise Hell. Never mind pulses.
Are you all right there Vincent?
I would be if you stopped using my name.
Drop the gun, fat boy.
You fucking idiots! He could not know my name. Give me the stone.
It's in the case.
What?
It's in the case!
You put the stone in the case? Then open the case and give me the stone.
The only man who knew the combination... you just shot.
Yob tvoyu mat...
Bad Boy. Sol.
Easy.
No, it's a moissanite.
A what-in-ite?
A moissanite is an artificial diamond, Lincoln. It's Mickey Mouse, mate. Spurious. Not genuine. And it's worth... fuck-all.
Bad Boy, I keep tellin' ya, stick to being a gangster. Leave this game to me and Sol.
Laters.
What is that, Vince?
This is a dog, Sol.
You are NOT bringing that thing in here.
What's your problem? It's only a fucking dog.
Where did you get it?
The gyppos. Here.
They threw it in with a load of moody gold. You know gyppos, Sol. They're always throwing dogs in with deals.
Well, it better not be dangerous.
What do you think you're doing now?
Well, I want him to get used to the shop, don't I?
Oi! Oi, stop the dog! Come back here!
All right, Boris? Don't worry about the dog.
I'm not.
What can I do for you, Boris?
I have a job for you.
I already have a job.
Fifty grand for half day's work.
Go on.
I want you to hold up a bookies.
You are a bad-boy yardie, and bad-boy yardies are supposed to know how to get rid of bodies.
I create the bodies. I don't erase the bodies.
What has he got a tea cozy on his head for?
To keep his head warm.
Well, what's the matter with him?
He's been shot in the face, Lincoln. I would've thought that was obvious.
Now I don't want to put a bullet in your face, but if you don't give us *exactly* what we want, there will be fucking murder.
What's your name?
Shoot him.
Ooh.
Oh, is that him?
I don't know, how many fingers did he have?
I'm sorry I couldn't get the bin-noc-u-lars out in time.
Look, well let's not stand in no ceremony mate, let's start the show."
Vinny,BL,Stupid Crooks,"So, you are obviously the big dick. The men on the side of ya are your balls. Now there are two types of balls. There are big brave balls, and there are little mincey faggot balls.
These are your last words, so make them a prayer.
Now, dicks have drive and clarity of vision, but they are not clever. They smell pussy and they want a piece of the action. And you thought you smelled some good old pussy, and have brought your two little mincey faggot balls along for a good old time. But you've got your parties muddled up. There's no pussy here, just a dose that'll make you wish you were born a woman. Like a prick, you are having second thoughts. You are shrinking, and your two little balls are shrinking with you. And the fact that you've got ""Replica"" written down the side of your guns...
And the fact that I've got ""Desert Eagle point five O""...
Written down the side of mine...
Should precipitate your balls into shrinking, along with your presence. Now... Fuck off!
I don't want that dog dribbling on my seats.
Your seats? Tyrone, this is a stolen car, mate.
I thought you said he was a getaway driver. What the fuck can he get away from, eh?
I didn't see it there.
It's a four ton truck, Tyrone. Its not as if it's a packet of fucking peanuts, is it?
It was a funny angle.
It's behind you Tyrone. Whenever you reverse, things come from behind you.
You're always gonna have problems lifting a body in one piece. Apparently the best thing to do is cut up a corpse into six pieces and pile it all together.

Too tight? You could land a jumbo fucking jet in that.

No, that's not it, Jerry.
Huh?
The new vehicle plus $40,000.
Yah, the deal was the car first then the $40,000 as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you that.
Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry. Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
Yah, I'm sorry. That was a mix up.
Yeah, you already said that.
Yah, but this is not a whole pay in advance deal. You see, I give you a brand new vehicle in advance and...
I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.
Okay.
I'm not gonna sit here and debate.
This could work out real good for me and Jean and Scotty.
Jean and Scotty never have to worry.
Alright, Jerry, I'm through fuckin' around! You got the fuckin' money?
Yeah, I got the money, but... uh...
Don't you fuckin' fuck me, Jerry! I want you to get this money to the parking garage at the Dayton Radisson, top level, in 30 minutes, Jerry. We wrap this thing up.
Yeah, but...
Hey, you're there in 30 minutes, Jerry, or I find you, Jerry, and I shoot you and I shoot your fuckin' wife and I shoot all your fuckin' children and I shoot them all in the back of their little fuckin' heads! You got it?
Okay, now you stay away from Scotty, now.
Jerry Lundegaard.
Alright, Jerry, you got the phone to yourself? Are you alone?
Well, yeah.
You know who this is?
Well, yeah, I got an idea. How's that Ciera working out for ya?
Circumstances have changed, Jerry.
Well, what do ya mean?
Things have changed, circumstances, Jerry... force majeure, acts of God.
How's Jean?
Who's Jean?
My wife! What the-?
Oh... right. She's alright, but there's a few people in Brainerd who aren't so okay, I'll tell you that.
What the heck are ya talking about? Let's just finish this deal up here.
Blood has been shed, Jerry.
What the heck do ya mean?
Three people, in Brainerd... are dead.
Oh, jeez!
That's right, we need more money.
What the heck are ya talking about? What do you fellas have yourself mixed up in?
Never mind that. We need more money...
This was supposed to be a no rough stuff type deal!
DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!
Well, I'm sorry, but I just... I don't...
I'm not gonna debate with you on this, Jerry! I'm not gonna debate! Three people in Brainerd were killed last night. We now want the entire 80,000!
Oh, for chris'sake here!
The heck do ya mean?
I'm, uh, Jerry Lundegaard.
You're Jerry Lundegaard?
Ya. Shep Proudfoot said...
Shep said you'd be here at 7:30. What gives, man?
Shep said 8:30.
We've been sitting here an hour. He's
peed three times already.
I'm sure sorry. Shep told me 8:30. It was a mix-up, I guess.
May I be excused?
Ya done, there?
Yah. Can I go out?
Where ya goin'?
Just to McDonalds.
Be back at 9:30.
He just ate - he didn't finish! He's goin' to McDonalds instead of finishin' here.
He sees his friends there. It's okay.
It's okay, MAC-Donalds. Heh. Whaddya think they do there? They don't drink milkshakes, I assure you.
It's okay, Dad!
I am talking about your potential. You're not a 'C' student.
Uh huh...
Yet you're gettin' 'C' grades. It's the disparity here that concerns your dad and me.
Mmmm.
Ya know what a disparity is?
Yeah!
Okay, then! That's why we don't want ya goin' out for hockey!
Oh, come on! What's the big deal? It's just an hour a... what's the big deal?
Hold on.
Hullo? Oh, hi, Dad! Yah! He's here, I'll catch him for ya!
Hon, it's Dad.
Look, Dad, there's no fucking way...
Hey, let's watch that language there!
Well, I'm sorry, sir!
Aw, what the Chris'!
Well, we've never done this before. But seeing as it's special circumstances and all, he says I can knock a hundred dollars off that Trucoat.
One hundred... You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard. You're a bald-faced liar. A... fucking liar.
Where's my goddamn checkbook? Let's get this over with.
Mr. Lundegaard? This is Reilly Diefenbach from GMAC. How are you this morning?
Real good. How are you?
Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard. I must say, you are damn hard to get a hold of over the phone.
Well, we're pretty darn busy here, but that's the way we like it.
Well, that's for sure. The reason why I've been trying to reach you is that these last financing documents that you sent over to us... I can't read the serial numbers of the vehicles...
Yah, well I already got the money. The loans are in place. I already got the...
Yah, the 320 thousand... you got the money last month from us.
So, we're all set then.
Yah, but the vehicles that you're borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read...
Yah, but the deal's already done. I've already got the money.
Yah, but we have an audit here and I just have to know that these vehicles that your financing with this money that they really exist.
Well... they exist all right.
Well, I'm pretty sure they do, but I can't read the serial numbers here. Maybe if you could read the numbers to me on the first...
Yah... well... see... I don't have them in front of me. Why don't I just fax you over a copy?
No, no, a fax is no good. That's what I have here and I can't read the darn thing.
Yah, I'll have my girl sent you a copy.
Okay, that's good. But I need to tell you that if I can't correlate these numbers with those specific vehicles, then I'm gonna have to call back all that money.
How much money did you say that was?
$320,000. I have to correlate that money with the cars that it's being lent on.
Okay, no problem. I'll just fax...
No, no...
I mean send it right over. I'll shoot it right over. Good bye.
I told ya. We haven't had any vehicles go missing.
Okay! But are ya sure? 'Cause I mean, how do you know? Do you do a count, or what kind of a routine do you have here?
Ma'am, I answered your question!
I'm sorry, sir?
Ma'am, I answered your question! I answered the darned... I'm cooperatin' here!
Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me! I'm just doing my job here.
I'm... I'm not arguing here! I'm cooperating. So there's no need to... we're doin' all we can here.
Sir, could I talk to Mr. Gustafson?
Mr. Lundegaard?
Three people were killed last night in Brainerd. We're in a load of trouble, Jerry. I'm comin' there tomorrow. You have the money ready by then.
Now, we had a deal. A deal's a deal.
Is it, Jerry? Why don't you ask those three poor souls in Brainerd if a deal's a deal? Go ahead, ask them!
The heck do ya mean?
""The heckya mean?"" I'll call you tomorrow!
I'm in a bit of trouble...
What kind of trouble are you in, Jerry?
Well, that's, that's... I'm not gonna go into, inta... see, I just need money.
Well, heck! If you wanna... If you wanna play games here, I'm working with ya on this thing here, but... Okay!
I'll do a damn lot count!
Sir, right now?
Yeah! Right now. You're darn tootin'! If it's so damned important to ya!
You see, my wife's dad is real well off.
So, why don't you just ask him for the money?
Or your fucking wife, you know.
Or your fuckin' wife, Jerry?
Well, it's all part of... look, the thing is they don't know that I'm in trouble. My wife and father-in-law don't know I need money. And if they did... I still won't get it. Okay? These are personal matters.
Personal matters? Okay, you're tasking us to perform this mission, but you won't tell us what... oh, fuck it. Let's have a look at the Ciera.
Hiya, hon! Welcome back! How was Fargo?
Yah, real good now.
Dad's here.
Is he stayin' for supper then?
I dunno... I think so. Dad?
What?
You stayin' for supperrrrr?
Yah!
Yah!
Jerome Lundegaard?
Yah.
This is Reilly Diefenbach from GMAC. Sir, I've not received those vehicle ID's you promised.
Yah, I... those are in the mail.
That very well may be. I must inform you, however, that absent the receipt of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon I will have to refer this matter to our legal department.
Yah.
My patience is at an end.
Yah.
Good day, Sir.
Yah.
We sat right here, in this room, and went over this and over this.
Yeah, but that TruCoat...
I sat right here and said I didn't want any TruCoat.
Yeah, but I'm saying that TruCoat. You don't get it, you get oxidation problems. It'll cost you a heck of a lot more than $500.
You're sitting there. You're talking in circles. You're talking like we didn't go over this already.
Yeah, but this TruCoat...
We had a deal here for nineteen-five. You sat there and darned if you didn't tell me you'd get me this car, these options, without the sealant for nineteen-five.
All right, I'm not saying I didn't...
You called me 20 minutes ago and said you had it ready to make delivery! You says, ""Come on down and get it."" And, and, and here you are and you're wasting my time and my wife's time, and I'm paying nineteen-five for this vehicle here!
All right. I'll talk to my boss.
See, they install that TruCoat at the factory. There's nothing we can do about that.
but I'll talk to my boss.
These guys here. These guys. It's always the same! It's always more!
What kind of finders fee are you looking for?
Huh?
The financials are pretty through. The only thing we don't know is your fee.
My fee? Wade, what the heck you talking about?
Stan and I are okay. We gotta load in. But we never talked about your fee for bringing it to us.
Wade, no. I was bringing you this deal for you to loan me the money to put in. It's my deal here, see?
Jerry, we thought you were bringing us an investment.
Yah, right.
But you're saying that... what are you saying?
You're saying that we put in all the money and you collect when it pays off?
No... it's just... I'd pay you back the principle and interest. Heck, I'd go... one over prime.
We're not a bank, Jerry.
If I wanted a bank interest loan on $750,000 I'd go to Midwest Federal and and talk to old Bill Deal.
Does he work at North Star now?
No, no, it just... I... I don't need a finders fee. Finder's fee that's... what? Ten percent? Heck, that's not gonna do it for me. I need the principle!
Jerry, we're not going to just give you $750,000 of our money.
What the heck were your thinking? If I am getting bank interest, I want complete security. Heck, FDIC. I don't see nothing like that here.
Yah, but... it's... I... just... I guarantee all your money back with interest when the deal starts paying. You have my word.
I'm not talking about your damn word here, Jerry! What the hell were you thinking? Jesus! Look... I don't want to cut you out of the loop here. This here is a good deal. I assume that if you are not interested in getting a finders fee, you won't mind if we move on with the deal independently."
Vincent Vega,BL,Stupid Crooks,"Don't you hate that?
What?
Uncomfortable silences. Why do we feel it's necessary to yak about bullshit in order to be comfortable?
I don't know. That's a good question.
That's when you know you've found somebody special. When you can just shut the fuck up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence.
You, flock of seagulls, you know why we're here? Why don't you tell my man Vincent where you got the shit hid at?
It's over th...
I don't remember askin' you a Goddamn thing! You were saying?
It's in the cupboard.
No, no, the one by your kn-knees.
We happy?
Vincent! We happy?
Yeah, we happy.
I'm sorry, I didn't get your name. I got yours, Vincent, right? But I didn't get yours...
My name's Pitt. And your ass ain't talkin' your way out of this shit.
No, no, I just want you to know... I just want you to know how sorry we are that things got so fucked up with us and Mr. Wallace. We got into this thing with the best intentions and I never...
I'm sorry, did I break your concentration? I didn't mean to do that. Please, continue, you were saying something about best intentions. What's the matter? Oh, you were finished! Well, allow me to retort. What does Marsellus Wallace look like?
What?
What country are you from?
What? What? Wh - ?
""What"" ain't no country I've ever heard of. They speak English in What?
What?
English, motherfucker, do you speak it?
Yes! Yes!
Then you know what I'm sayin'!
Yes!
Describe what Marsellus Wallace looks like!
What?
Say 'what' again. Say 'what' again, I dare you, I double dare you motherfucker, say what one more Goddamn time!
And you know what they call a... a... a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris?
They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with cheese?
No man, they got the metric system. They wouldn't know what the fuck a Quarter Pounder is.
Then what do they call it?
They call it a Royale with cheese.
A Royale with cheese. What do they call a Big Mac?
Well, a Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it le Big-Mac.
Le Big-Mac. Ha ha ha ha. What do they call a Whopper?
I dunno, I didn't go into Burger King.
Want some bacon?
No man, I don't eat pork.
Are you Jewish?
Nah, I ain't Jewish, I just don't dig on swine, that's all.
Why not?
Pigs are filthy animals. I don't eat filthy animals.
Bacon tastes gooood. Pork chops taste gooood.
Hey, sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie, but I'd never know 'cause I wouldn't eat the filthy motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in shit. That's a filthy animal. I ain't eat nothin' that ain't got sense enough to disregard its own feces.
How about a dog? Dogs eats its own feces.
I don't eat dog either.
Yeah, but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal?
I wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy but they're definitely dirty. But, a dog's got personality. Personality goes a long way.
Ah, so by that rationale, if a pig had a better personality, he would cease to be a filthy animal. Is that true?
Well we'd have to be talkin' about one charming motherfuckin' pig. I mean he'd have to be ten times more charmin' than that Arnold on Green Acres, you know what I'm sayin'?
Fuck, nigga, what the fuck did you do to his towel?
I was dryin' my hands.
You're supposed to wash 'em first!
You watched me wash 'em.
I watched you get 'em wet.
I was washing 'em. But this shit's hard to get off. Maybe if I had Lava or something, I coulda done a better job.
I used the same fuckin' soap you did and when I got finished, the towel didn't look like no goddamn Maxi-Pad!
Oh, man, I will never forgive your ass for this shit. This is some fucked-up repugnant shit.
Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy that once a man admits that he's wrong that he is immediately forgiven for all wrongdoings? Have you ever heard that?
Get the fuck out my face with that shit! The motherfucker that said that shit never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces of skull on account of your dumb ass.
I got a threshold, Jules. I got a threshold for the abuse that I will take. Now, right now, I'm a fuckin' race car, right, and you got me the red. And I'm just sayin', I'm just sayin' that it's fuckin' dangerous to have a race car in the fuckin' red. That's all. I could blow.
Oh! Oh! You ready to blow?
Yeah, I'm ready to blow.
Well, I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker, motherfucker! Every time my fingers touch brain, I'm Superfly T.N.T., I'm the Guns of the Navarone! IN FACT, WHAT THE FUCK AM I DOIN' IN THE BACK? YOU'RE THE MOTHERFUCKER WHO SHOULD BE ON BRAIN DETAIL! We're fuckin' switchin'! I'm washin' the windows, and you're pickin' up this nigger's skull!
Jimmie, lead the way. Boys, get to work.
A please would be nice.
Come again?
I said a please would be nice.
Get it straight buster - I'm not here to say please, I'm here to tell you what to do and if self-preservation is an instinct you possess you'd better fucking do it and do it quick. I'm here to help - if my help's not appreciated then lotsa luck, gentlemen.
No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that, your help is definitely appreciated.
I don't mean any disrespect, I just don't like people barking orders at me.
If I'm curt with you it's because time is a factor. I think fast, I talk fast and I need you guys to act fast if you wanna get out of this. So, pretty please... with sugar on top. Clean the fucking car.
Vincent, do you still want to hear my Fox Force Five joke?
Sure, but I think I'm still a little too petrified to laugh.
No, you wont laugh, 'cus it's not funny. But if you still wanna hear it, I'll tell it.
I can't wait.
Three tomatoes are walking down the street- a poppa tomato, a momma tomato, and a little baby tomato. Baby tomato starts lagging behind. Poppa tomato gets angry, goes over to the baby tomato, and smooshes him... and says, Catch up.
Whoa!
What the fuck's happening, man? Ah, shit man!
Oh man, I shot Marvin in the face.
Why the fuck did you do that!
Well, I didn't mean to do it, it was an accident!
Oh man I've seen some crazy ass shit in my time...
Chill out, man. I told you it was an accident. You probably went over a bump or something.
Hey, the car didn't hit no motherfucking bump!
Hey, look man, I didn't mean to shoot the son of a bitch. The gun went off. I don't know why.
Well look at this fucking mess, man. We're on a city street in broad daylight here!
I don't believe it.
Well believe it now, motherfucker! We gotta get this car off the road! You know cops tend to notice shit like you're driving a car drenched in fucking blood.
Just take it to a friendly place, that's all.
This is the Valley, Vincent. Marsellus ain't got no friendly places in the Valley.
Well Jules, this ain't my fucking town, man!
Shit!
What you doin'?
I'm calling Jimmie, my old partner. He lives in Toluca Lake.
Where's Toluca Lake?
It's just over the hill here over by Burbank Studios. If Jimmie's ass ain't home, I don't know what the fuck we're going to do, man. 'Cause I ain't got no other partners in 8-1-8.
Hey Jimmie, yo! How you doin', man? It's Jules. Listen up man. Me and my homeboy are in serious fucking shit. We're in a car and we gotta get off the road, pronto. I need to use your garage for a couple of hours.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go home and have a heart attack.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... stop right there. Eatin' a bitch out, and givin' a bitch a foot massage ain't even the same fuckin' thing.
It's not. It's the same ballpark.
Ain't no fuckin' ballpark neither. Now look, maybe your method of massage differs from mine, but, you know, touchin' his wife's feet, and stickin' your tongue in her Holiest of Holies, ain't the same fuckin' ballpark, it ain't the same league, it ain't even the same fuckin' sport. Look, foot massages don't mean shit.
Have you ever given a foot massage?
Don't be tellin' me about foot massages. I'm the foot fuckin' master.
Given a lot of 'em?
Shit yeah. I got my technique down and everything, I don't be ticklin' or nothin'.
Would you give a guy a foot massage?
Fuck you.
You give them a lot?
Fuck you.
You know, I'm getting kinda tired. I could use a foot massage myself.
Man, you best back off, I'm gittin' a little pissed here.
Hey, whattya think about Trudi? She ain't got a boyfriend. You wanna hang out, get high?
Which one's Trudi? The one with all the shit in her face?
No, that's Jody. That's my wife.
We should have shotguns for this kind of deal.
How many up there?
Three or four.
That's countin' our guy?
Not sure.
So that means there could be up to five guys up there?
It's possible.
We should have fuckin' shotguns.
Hey kids! How you boys doin'?
Hey, keep chillin'. You know who we are? We're associates of your business partner Marsellus Wallace. You do remember your business partner don't you? Let me take a wild guess here. You're Brett, right?
Yeah.
I thought so. You remember your business partner Marsellus Wallace, don't you, Brett?
Yeah, yeah, I remember him.
Good. Looks like me an Vincent caught you boys at breakfast. Sorry about that. Whatcha havin'?
Hamburgers.
Hamburgers! The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast. What kind of hamburgers?
Ch-cheeseburgers.
No, no no, where'd you get 'em? McDonalds? Wendy's? Jack in the Box? Where?
Big Kahuna Burger.
Big Kahuna Burger. That's that Hawaiian burger joint. I hear they got some tasty burgers. I ain't never had one myself. How are they?
They're good.
Mind if I try one of yours? This is yours here, right?
Mmm-mmmm. That is a tasty burger. Vincent, ever have a Big Kahuna Burger?
Wanna bite? They're real tasty.
Ain't hungry.
Well, if you like burgers give 'em a try sometime. I can't usually get 'em myself because my girlfriend's a vegitarian which pretty much makes me a vegitarian. But I do love the taste of a good burger. Mm-mm-mm. You know what they call a Quarter Pounder with cheese in France?
No.
Tell 'em, Vincent.
A Royale with cheese.
A Royale with cheese! You know why they call it that?
Because of the metric system?
Check out the big brain on Brett! You're a smart motherfucker. That's right. The metric system. What's in this?
Sprite.
Sprite, good. You mind if I have some of your tasty beverage to wash this down?
Go right ahead.
Ah, hit the spot.
You're going to give her an injection of adrenaline directly to her heart. But she's got, uh, breastplate...
So you gotta pierce through that. So what you have to do is, you have to bring the needle down in a stabbing motion.
I-I gotta stab her three times?
No, you don't gotta fucking stab her three times! You gotta stab her once, but it's gotta be hard enough to break through her breastplate into her heart, and then once you do that, you press down on the plunger.
What happens after that?
I'm kinda curious about that myself...
This was Divine Intervention! You know what ""divine intervention"" is?
Yeah, I think so. That means God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets.
Yeah, man, that's what it means. That's exactly what it means! God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets.
I think we should be going now.
Don't do that! Don't you fucking do that! Don't blow this shit off! What just happened was a fucking miracle!
Chill the fuck out, Jules, this shit happens.
Wrong! Wrong, this shit doesn't just happen.
Do you wanna continue this theological discussion in the car, or at the jailhouse with the cops?
We should be fuckin' dead now, my friend! We just witnessed a miracle, and I want you to fucking acknowledge it!
Okay man, it was a miracle, can we leave now?
I think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot.
Pilot? What's a pilot?
Well, you know the shows on TV?
I don't watch TV.
Yeah, but, you are aware that there's an invention called television, and on this invention they show shows, right?
Yeah.
Well, the way they pick TV shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that one show to the people who pick shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they want to make more shows. Some get chosen and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.
You know what they put on French fries in Holland instead of ketchup?
What?
Mayonnaise.
Goddamn.
I've seen 'em do it, man. They fuckin' drown 'em in that shit.
Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'?
I ain't saying it's right. But you're saying a foot massage don't mean nothing, and I'm saying it does. Now look, I've given a million ladies a million foot massages, and they all meant something. We act like they don't, but they do, and that's what's so fucking cool about them. There's a sensuous thing going on where you don't talk about it, but you know it, she knows it, fucking Marsellus knew it, and Antwone should have fucking better known better. I mean, that's his fucking wife, man. He can't be expected to have a sense of humor about that shit. You know what I'm saying?
That's an interesting point. Come on, let's get into character.
Hello.
Lance! It's Vincent. I'm in big fuckin' trouble, man. I'm coming to your house.
Whoa. Whoa. Hold your horses, man. What's the problem?
I've got this chick, she fuckin' O.D.in' on me!
Well, don't bring her here! I'm not even fuckin' joking with you, man! Do not be bringing some fucked-up pooh-bah to my house!
No choice.
She's O.D.in'?
She's fuckin' dyin' on me, man!
Okay, then you bite the fuckin' bullet, take her to a hospital and call a lawyer.
Negative.
This is not my fuckin' problem, man! You fucked her up, you fuckin' deal with this!
Strip.
All the way?
To your bare ass.
Is this necessary?
Yes. You know what you guys look like?
What?
Like a couple of guys who just blew off somebody's head!
Now Jimmie, hand them the soap.
Well, now I'm sure you've all been to county.
You lookin at something, friend?
You ain't my friend, Palooka.
What's that?
I think you heard me just fine, Punchy.
Look, do you wanna play blindman? Go walk with the shepherd. But me, my eyes are wide fucking open.
What the fuck does that mean?
It means, that's it for me. From here on in you can consider my ass retired.
Jesus Christ.
Don't blaspheme.
Goddamn.
I said don't do that!
Jules, if you give that fuckin' nimrod fifteen hundred dollars, I'm gonna shoot him on general principles.
You remember Antoine Roccamora, half black, half Samoan, used to call him Tony Rocky Horror?
Yeah, maybe. Fat, right?
I wouldn't go so far as to call the brother fat, I mean he got a weight problem. What's the nigger gonna do? He's Samoan.
Do you know what they call a Quarter Pounder with cheese in France?
No.
Tell him, Vincent.
Royale with cheese.
Royale with cheese. Do you know why they call it a Royale with cheese?
Because of the metric system?
Check out the big brain on Brett. You one smart motherfucker.
So, I hear you're taking Mia out.
At Marsellus's request.
You met Mia yet?
No.
What's so fucking funny?
I gotta piss.
Look, I'm not stupid. It's the Big Man's wife. I'm gonna sit across from her, chew my food with my mouth closed, laugh at her fucking jokes, and that's it.
Why the fuck didn't you tell us somebody was in the bathroom? Slipped your mind? Did you forget that somebody was in there with a goddamn hand cannon?
That's the Marilyn Monroe section that's Mamie Van Doren... I don't see Jayne Mansfield, she must have the night off or something.
What the fuck is this place?
This is ""Jack Rabbit Slim's"". An Elvis man should love it.
Come on, Mia. Let's go and get a steak.
You can get a steak here daddy-o. Don't be a...
Oh after you, Kitty Kat.
Here, I'll tell you what to do.
No no no no man, man I ain't giving her... You... you, you're gonna give her the shot...
No, you're gonna give her the shot...
I ain't givin' her the shot...
Well, I ain't givin' her the shot!
I never done this before!
Yeah, I ain't ever done it before either, alright? I ain't starting now! Look, you brought her here, and that means that you're giving her the shot. The day that I bring an OD-ing bitch over to your house, then I give her the shot. Give her the shot.
Give it to me.
Here.
Gimme that.
Still got your Malibu?
Aw, man. You know what some fucker did the other day?
What?
Fucking keyed it.
Oh, man, that's fucked up.
Tell me about it. I had it in storage for three years, it was out for five days and some dickless piece of shit fucked with it.
They should be fucking killed. No trial, no jury, straight to execution.
Boy, I wish I could've caught him doing it. I'd have given anything to catch that asshole doing it. It'd been worth him doing it just so I could've caught him doing it.
What a fucker!
What's more chickenshit than fucking with a man's automobile? I mean, don't fuck with another man's vehicle.
You don't do it.
It's just against the rules.
Maybe I can give you guys a ride. Where do you live?
Redondo Beach.
Inglewood.
In your future... I see a cab ride. Move out of the sticks, gentlemen.
I think we should be leaving now.
Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
So, tell me again about the hashbars?
Okay, what you wanna know?
Hash is legal there in Amsterdam, right?
Yeah, it's legal, but it ain't a hundred percent legal. I mean, you can't just walk into a restaurant, roll a joint and start puffing away. You're only supposed to smoke in your home or certain designated places.
And those are hashbars?
Yeah. It breaks down like this: it's legal to buy it, it's legal to own it, and, if you're the proprietor of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it. It's still illegal to carry it around, but that doesn't really matter 'cause... get a load of this: if you get stopped by the cops in Amsterdam, it's illegal for them to search you. I mean, that's a right the cops in Amsterdam don't have.
I'm going, that's all there is to it, I'm fuckin' going.
Yeah baby, you'd dig it the most.
Hurry up, Lance! We're losing her!
I'm lookin' as fast as I can!
What's he looking for?
I dunno. Some book.
What're you looking for?
A little black medical book!
What're you looking for?
A little black fuckin' medical book! It's like a textbook they give to nurses.
I never saw no medical book.
Trust me, I have one.
Well, if it's so important, why don't you keep it with the shot?
I DON'T KNOW! STOP BOTHERING ME!
Listen, while you're looking for it, that girl's gonna die on our carpet! You're never gonna find anything in this mess!
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you IF YOU DON'T SHUT UP!
STOP ARGUING AND GET IN HERE!
You know how they use that gun to pierce your ears? They don't use that when they pierce your nipples, do they?
Forget that gun. That gun goes against the entire idea behind piercing. All of my piercings, sixteen places on my body, all of them done with a needle. Five in each ear, one through the nipple on my left breast, one through my right nostril, one through my left eyebrow, one in my lip, one in my clit... and I wear a stud in my tongue.
Excuse me, but I was just wondering... why do you wear a stud in your tongue?
It's a sex thing. It helps fellatio.
Don Vincenzo. Step into my office?
Don't you just love it when you come back from the bathroom and find your food waiting for you?
We're lucky we got anything at all. I don't think Buddy Holly's much of a waiter.
I don't know why, I just thought he'd be European or something because he...
Yeah, man, he's about as European as fuckin' English Bob.
That's a pretty fucking good milkshake. I don't know if it's worth five dollars but it's pretty fucking good.
You are not bringing this fucked-up bitch into my house!
This fucked-up bitch is Marsellus Wallace's wife! Do you know who Marsellus Wallace is? Do you? If she croaks on me, I'm a fuckin' greasespot!
Now boys, listen up. We're going to a place called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow. I'll drive the tainted car. Jules, you ride with me. Vincent, you follow in my Acura. We run across the path of any John Q. Laws, nobody does a fucking thing unless I do it first. What did I just say?
Don't do shit unless.
Unless what?
Unless you do it first.
Spoken like a true prodigy. How about you, Lash LaRue? You think you can keep your spurs from jinglin' and janglin'?
Look, Mr. Wolf, my gun went off, I don't know why, and now you're helping us out of the situation. I'm cool with it, all right?
Fair enough. Now I drive real fucking fast, so keep up. I get my car back any differently than when I gave it, Monster Joe's gonna be disposing of two bodies.
You know the shows on TV?
I don't watch TV.
Yeah, but, you are aware that there's an invention called television, and on this invention they show shows, right?
I'll just walk the earth.
What'cha mean walk the earth?
You know, walk the earth, meet people... get into adventures. Like Caine from ""Kung Fu.""
I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak, and a vanilla Coke.
How would you like that? Burnt to a crisp or bloody as hell?
Bloody as hell.
I promise I won't laugh.
That's what I'm afraid of, Vincent.
Who's she?
Look, go to the fridge and get the thing with the O.D. adrenalin shot.
What's wrong with her?
She's O.D.ing!
Get her the hell outta her!
, :
GET THE SHOT!
, :
GET THE SHOT!
Fuck you! Fuck you, too!
What a fuckin' bitch!
You just keep talking to her, all right? She's getting the shot, I'm gonna get my little black medical book.
What the fuck do you need a medical book for?
I've never had to give an adrenalin shot.
You never give an adrenalin shot?
I've never had to, all right! I don't go joy-poppin' with bubble-gummers! My friends can handle their highs!
GET THE SHOT!
Oh, fuck! I'm fucked. Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!
Is he a friend of yours?
Hmm? Oh, Vincent, Marvin. Marvin, Vincent.
Better tell him to shut the fuck up. He's gettin' on my nerves!
Marvin? Marvin... MARVIN!
I'd knock that shit off if I was you.
Thank you. Mind if I shoot it up here?
Hey, mi casa su casa.
Remember, I just got back from Amsterdam.
Am I a nigger? Are we in Inglewood? No... You're in my home. White people who know the difference between good shit and bad shit, this is the house they come to. Now, my shit, I'll take the Pepsi challenge with that Amsterdam shit, any day of the fuckin' week.
That's a bold statement.
This ain't Amsterdam, Vince. This is a sellers market. Coke is fucking dead as... dead. Heroin, it's coming back in a big fucking way.
If you'll excuse me, I gotta go home and have a heart attack.
In conversation, do you listen or wait to talk?
I have to admit that I wait to talk, but I'm trying harder to listen.
Get her the shot!
I will if you let me.
I ain't fuckin' stopping you!
Well, then quit talking to me, talk to her.
Get the shot!
Oh, Jesus Christ. Oh, fuck me! Fuck me!
Go home, cool off, and that's all you got to do."
Han,C,Arrogant Kungfu Guy,"It is difficult to associate these horrors with the proud civilizations that created them: Sparta, Rome, The Knights of Europe, the Samurai... They worshipped strength, because it is strength that makes all other values possible. Nothing survives without it.

Mr. Han, suddenly I wish to leave your island.
It is not possible.
Bullshit, Mr. Han-man!

Very few people can be totally ruthless. It isn't easy; it takes more strength than you might believe.

What are you going to do to him?
Not me, Mr. Roper, you.

Uh-oh!
We are investing in corruption, Mr Roper. The business of corruption is like any other.
Oh yeah! Provide your customers with products they need and, uh, charge a little bit to stimulate your market and before you know it customers come to depend on you, I mean really need you.
Are you shocked Mr Williams?
Only at how sloppy your man works.
We are all ready to win, just as we are born knowing only life. It is defeat that you must learn to prepare for.
I don't waste my time with it. When it comes, I won't even notice.
Oh? How so?
I'll be too busy looking gooood.
Gentlemen, welcome. You honor our island. I look forward to a tournament of truly epic proportions. We are unique, gentlemen, in that we create ourselves... through long years of rigorous training, sacrifice, denial, pain. We forge our bodies in the fire of our will. But tonight, let us celebrate. Gentlemen, you have our gratitude.

Class, we have visitors. Fall in behind me. Hai!
I hear you jumped some of my students last night.
Afraid facts mixed up.
You calling Mr. Lawrence a liar?
No call no one nothing.
What are you here for, old man?
Come ask leave boy alone.
What's the matter, the boy can't take care of his own problems?
One to one problem, yes. FIVE to one problem, too much ask anyone.
Is that what's bothering you? The odds? Well, we can fix that. Feel like matching, Mr. Lawrence?
Yes, sensei!
No more fighting.
This is a karate dojo, not a knitting class. You don't come into my dojo, drop a challenge and leave, old man. Now you get your boy on the mat, or you and I will have a major problem.
Too much advantage. Your dojo.
Name a place.
Tournament.
You've got real nerve, old man. Real nerve. But I think we can accomodate you. Can't we, Mr. Lawrence?
Yes, sensei.
Fall in.
Ask one more small request.
Make it fast.
Ask leave boy alone to train.
You're a pushy little bastard, ain't ya? But I like that. I like that! All right. No one touches the prima donna until the tournament. Is that understood?
But if you don't show, it's open season on him... and you.
THE NEW CHAMPION...
You're all right, LaRusso!
...DANIEL LARUSSO!
Good match!
Thanks a lot!
Looking for a shortcut back to Newark, Daniel?
I THINK he wants to learn KARATE! Right?
Yeah! Okay, here's your first lesson: how to take a FALL!
You couldn't leave well enough alone, could you, little twerp? No, you had to push it. Well, now you're gonna pay!
Where you going, sweetheart?
Give him a front kick, Johnny!
Get him up!
Leave him alone, man... he's had enough.
Shut up, Bobby!
Look at him, Dutch! He can't even stand up!
So what?
That don't mean squat!
Johnny... leave him alone, man! He's had enough!
I'll decide when he's had enough, man!
What is wrong with you, Johnny?
An enemy deserves no mercy!
Right!
Right?
Right!
You're crazy, man!
Tommy, Bobby... get him!
... Got something for you. All-Valley Tournament application. You fill that out and send it in, so they'll know where to claim the body. Next-of-kin stuff, ya know?
Let me ask you something: We both know you can stomp me, anytime and anywhere, for any reason. So why bother rubbing it in?
Maybe I like rubbing it in.
Don't you ever think that he
might be wrong - at least, about some things?
Sweep the leg.
Do you have a problem with that?
No, Sensei.
No mercy.

Jen Yu,C,Arrogant Kungfu Guy,"You want to know who I am? I am... I am the Invincible Sword Goddess, armed with the Green Destiny that knows no equal! Be you Li or Southern Crane, bow your head and ask for mercy! I am the dragon from the desert! Who comes from nowhere and leaves no trace! Today I fly over Eu-Mei. Tomorrow... I topple Mount Wudan!
Follow me.
I want a clean room.
We have plenty... Your order?
Steamed whole cod, bite-size meatballs, a little starchy but keep the sauce light, shark fin soup, mixed vegetables and some warm wine.
We only have one chef.
Then get him started.
Make a wish, Lo.
All this trouble for a comb?
It's mine. It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
It must exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free.
Fighters have rules, too. Friendship, trust, integrity. Always keep your promise. Without rules we wouldn't survive long.
Who are you?
I'm Shining Phoenix Mountain Gou.
Gou? A name I abhor. When I hear it, my ears start to ache. I feel like vomiting!
And suddenly I cannot hold back my sword hand's anger!
You don't seem to understand.
So what if I don't?
We have ways of making you understand...
I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
So I heard. Congratulations.
It's a great fortune to marry into such a noble family.
Is it? Actually, I like the great heroes in the books... just like you and Li Mu Bai. Marriage is a good thing. If only I could be free to live my own life... to choose who I love and love him in my own way. That's real happiness.
Why do you want to teach me?
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of the Wudang secrets.
How long would you last as my enemy?
Who am I?
You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in stillness.
Why do you want to teach me?
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
And if I use them to kill you?
That's a risk I'm willing to take. Deep down you're good. Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you."
Pai Mei,C,Arrogant Kungfu Guy,"Since your arm now belongs to me, I want it strong. Can you do that?
I can, but not that close.
Then you can't do it. What if your enemy is three inches in front of you, what do you do then? Curl into a ball? Or do you put your fist through him?
I was wondering, just between us girls, what did you say to Pai Mei for him to snatch out your eye?
I called him a miserable old fool.
Ooh, bad idea.
You know what I did? I killed that miserable old fool.
How do you like the fishheads you miserable old fool?
I poisoned his fishheads.
Elle, you treacherous dog. I give you my word...
And I told him, ""To me the word of an old fool like you is worth less than nothing.""
It's the wood that should fear your hand, not the other way around. No wonder you can't do it, you acquiesce to defeat before you even begin.
Do you believe you are my match?
No.
Are you aware I kill at will?
Yes.
Is it your wish to die?
No.
Then you must be stupid... so stupid.
Just like all Yankee women, all you are good at is ordering in restaurants... and spending a man's money!
Master...
Your Mandarin is lousy. It causes my ears great discomfort. You bray like an ass! You are not to speak unless spoken to! It is too much to hope but... do you speak Cantonese?
I speak Japanese very well... as well as...
I didn't ask if you speak Japanese! I asked if you understood Cantonese.
If you want to eat like a dog, you can live and sleep outside like a dog. If you want to live and sleep like a human, pick up those sticks!
So my pathetic friend... is there anything that you can do well?
The exquisite art of the samurai sword? Don't make me laugh! You're so-called exquisite art is only fit for Japanese fatheads!
Your swordsmanship is amateur at best.
It's my arm now, I'll do what I want with it.
From here you can get an excellent view of my foot.
Your so-called kung-fu... is really... quite pathetic.
I despise the goddamn Japs!"
Apollo Creed,C,Arrogant Kungfu Guy,"Apollo Creed vs. the Italian Stallion. Sounds like a damn monster movie.
Ain't gonna be no rematch.
Don't want one.
Stay in school and use your brain. Be a doctor, be a lawyer, carry a leather briefcase. Forget about sports as a profession. Sports make ya grunt and smell. See, be a thinker, not a stinker.
Hey, champ, you oughta come and look at this boy you're gonna fight on TV. It looks like he means business.
Yeah, yeah. I mean business too.
What exactly are you looking for Apollo?
This is who I'm looking for. The Italian Stallion.
Rocky Balboa? Never heard of him.
Look it's the name man. The I-talian Stallion. The media will eat it up. Now who discovered America? An Italian right? What better way to get it on than with one of its descendants?
He's a southpaw. I don't want you messing with southpaws. They do everything backwards
Southpaw nothing. I'll drop him in three. Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion. Now that sounds like a damn monster movie.
You'd better stop this fight! You ain't nothin' but a bum!"
Clubber Lang,C,Arrogant Kungfu Guy,"Do you hate Rocky?
No, I don't hate Balboa. I pity the fool, and I will destroy any man who tries to take what I got!
What's your prediction for the fight?
My prediction?
Yes, your prediction.
Pain!
What are you doing? I wanna fight this guy.
Well, you got him. But you'll fight him without me.
What are you saying?
It's finished. Yes, I'm finished. I don't want no more of this. I don't want no more of it! You understand? None of it! It's over with!
Hey, Woman. Hey, Woman! Listen here. Since your old man ain't got no heart, maybe you like to see a real man. I bet you stay up late every night dreamin' you had a real man, don't ya? I'll tell you what. Bring your pretty little self over to my apartment tonight, and I'll show you a real man.
You want it, you got it! YOU GOT IT!
I'll see you in the ring! You got it!
Hey, boy. Hey, boy. After I crucify him, you next.
Just stay outta my face, chump.
Don't turn your back on me, sucka!
I thought you said be cool!
That *was* cool!
Getting out while you can? Don't give this sucker no statue. Give him guts! I told you I wasn't going away. You got your shot, now give me mine.
Why don't you get the hell out of there?
Shut up, Old Man! I ain't goin' nowhere. Why don't you all these nice folks why you been duckin' me? Politics, man. This country want to keep me down. Keep everybody weak. They don't want me to have the title because I'm not a puppet like that fool up there.
You know, you got a big mouth, you know?
Well, why don't you come down here and close it, Balboa? Come on. Come on.
Anytime.
This guy's crazy. Don't listen to him.
The little man don't wanna come to me. Then I'll come to you people to lay out the truth. I am ranked Number One. ONE! That means I'm the best! But this bum been taking the easy matches, fighting other bums. I'm telling you and everybody here, I'm fight him anywhere, anytime, for nothing.
But you people ain't never gonna see that happen because he's gonna retire. You see, he don't fight no real man. He fights those setups.
What?
You're a disgrace to this sport!
Shut up, Old Man! You don't know what I had to come from! Balboa, your family doin' real nice, ain't it, and you call yourself a fighter? Prove it now. Give me that same chance. The way you been duckin' is a disgrace. If he ain't no coward, why don't he fight me then?
I can't listen to any more of this. Anytime you want...
I don't care what you're ranked! You don't get no shot AND I MEAN THAT!
I'm the baddest man in the world.
You don't look so bad to me.
What did you say, Paper Champion? I'll beat you like a dog, a dog, you fool!
I want Balboa! I want Balboa! You hear that, Old Man? You tell Balboa to come here! Nobody can beat me! You tell him what I said! And he's NEXT! I'm gonna kill him! Nobody can stop me! You tell Balboa that! I'M COMING AFTER HIM! YOU TELL HIM!
I'm going to bust you up.
Go for it.
Dead meat!
We'd like to announce the presence at ringside of a true champion; the Master of Disaster, the Count of Monte Fisto, the one, the only Apollo Creed!
Get out of my face! I don't need no has-beens in my corner. And you better wipe that look off your face before I knock it off. You wanna jump, JUMP! Come on! Come on, Creed! Come on!
Do everybody a favor and knock this chump out.
I'm gonna torture him. I'm gonna crucify him. Real bad.
Hey fool! You ready for another beating? You shoulda never came back!"
Storm Shadow,C,Arrogant Kungfu Guy,"He gave up.
He never gives up.
I told you I'd kill him if he touched you again.
I heard you the first time.
This belongs to an ancestor of mine. He was caught selling arms to both sides. The French forced him to wear it for the rest of his life. They called him Destro, destroyer of nations.
So why do you keep it?
So that I never forget the most important rule in dealing arms.
Let me guess. Never sell to both sides?
Never get caught selling to both sides.
McCullen gave me orders to kill the Baron if he so much as touched you.
Well, he's my husband. Of course he touches me. And besides, his work at the lab goes much better after we've touched. And that's the important thing.
Three left.
Take the warheads to the missiles. I want them ready to launch in one hour.
It will be done.
If I were really there, I might actually let you touch me.
I'll send a jet.
Business first. Besides, I'm married, remember?
If you had sent me in the first place, it would already be done.
I'm sending you now, Storm Shadow. No more mistakes. The schedule mustn't compromise any further. Keep your eye on her for me.
When our master was killed, you took a vow of silence. Now you will die without a word.
Now how do we get out of here?
Follow me!
Like that's gonna happen.
Hello, brother.
Oh. That's right. You don't kill women.
For you, Zartan, I'd make an exception.
I did not kill our master..."
Kurgan,C,Arrogant Kungfu Guy,"This is a house of God. People are trying to pray. You're disturbing them.
He cares about these helpless mortals?
Of course He cares. He died for our sins.
That shall be His undoing.
Father! Forgive me , I am a worm...
I have something to say! It's better to burn out than to fade away!
Happy Hallowe'en, ladies!
Nuns. No sense of humor.
Ramirez's blade did not cut deeply enough. He was right about you. You're slime.
Ramirez was an effete snob! He died on his knees. I took his head and raped his woman before his blood was even cold.
Ah, I see. Ramirez lied. She was not his woman. She was *your* woman. And she never told you. I wonder why. Perhaps I gave her something you never could, and secretly she yearned for my return.
Holy *ground*, Highlander! Remember what Ramirez taught you.
The garage is watered from the sprinklers. It also left a man's decapitated body lying on the floor next to his own severed head. The head, which of this time, has no name.
I know his name.
At last. The Gathering...
Hi. I'm Candy.
Of course you are...
Mom...
You can't defeat me, Ramirez! I am the strongest!
My cut has improved your voice!
I'm in disguise!
Tonight you sleep in hell.
Hey, Rockefeller. I hear you liked Candy. She said you were kinda kinky.
Don't ever speak to me.
So now it ends...
Who is the woman?
She's MINE!
Ah! Not for much longer...
Hello, pretty...
Another time, Macleod!"
Richard Vernon,W,Dean Bitterman,"You're not fooling anyone, Bender. The next screw that falls out will be you.
Eat my shorts.
What was that?
Eat... My... Shorts.
You just bought yourself another Saturday.
Ooh, I'm crushed.
You just bought one more.
Well I'm free the Saturday after that. Beyond that, I'm going to have to check my calendar.
Good, cause it's going to be filled. We'll keep going. You want another one? Just say the word say it. Instead of going to prison you'll come here. Are you through?
No.
I'm doing society a favor.
So?
That's another one right now! I've got you for the rest of your natural born life if you don't watch your step. You want another one?
Yes.
You got it! You got another one right there! That's another one pal!
Cut it out!
You through?
Not even close bud!
Good! You got one more right there!
You really think I give a shit?
Another! You through?
How many is that?
That's seven including when we first came in and you asked Mr. Vernon whether Barry Manilow knew that he raided his closet.
Now it's eight. You stay out of this.
Excuse me sir, it's seven.
What if your home... what if your family... what if your *dope* was on fire?
Impossible, sir. It's in Johnson's underwear.
Jesus Christ Almighty! What in God' s name is going on in here? What was that ruckus?
Uh, what ruckus?
I was just in my office and I heard a ruckus.
Could you describe the ruckus, sir?
Don't you want to hear my excuse?
Out.
I'm thinkin' of tryin' out for a scholarship.
Well, well. Here we are. I want to congratulate you for being on time.
Excuse me, sir. I think there's been a mistake. I know it's detention but I don't think I belong in here.
It is now 7:06. You have exactly 8 hours and 54 minutes to think about WHY you are here - to ponder the error of your ways. You will not talk... You will now move from these seats.
And YOU... will not sleep.
All right people, we're going to try something a little different today. We are going to write an essay of no less than a thousand words describing to me who you think you are.
Is this a test?
And when I say 'essay', I mean 'essay'. I do not mean a single word repeated a thousand times. Is that clear, Mr. Bender?
Crystal.
Good. Maybe you'll learn a little something about yourself. You might even decide whether or not you'd care to return.
Uh, you know, I can answer that right now, sir. That'd be no... No from me, 'cause...
Sit down, Johnson.
Thank you, sir.
My office is right across that hall. Any monkey business is ill-advised. Any questions?
Yeah, I got a question. Does Barry Manilow know that you raid his wardrobe?
You'll get the answer to that question, Mr. Bender, next Saturday. Don't mess with the bull, young man - you'll get the horns.
That man... is a brownie hound.
He's just doing it to get a rise out of you. Just ignore him.
Sweets. You couldn't ignore me if you tried. So... so. Are you guys like boyfriend-girlfriend? Steady dates? Lovers? Come on, sporto, level with me. Do you slip her the hot beef injection?
Go to HELL.
Enough.
Hey. What's goin in there? Damn pricks.
That's the last time, Bender. That the last time you ever make me look bad in front of those kids, you hear me? I make $31,000 a year and I have a home and I'm not about to throw it all away on some punk like you. But someday when you're outta here and you've forgotten all about this place and they've forgotten all about you, and you're wrapped up in your own pathetic life, I'm gonna be there. That's right. And I'm gonna kick the living shit out of you. I'm gonna knock your dick in the dirt.
You threatening me?
What are you gonna do about it? You think anyone's gonna believe you? You think anyone is gonna take your word over mine? I'm a man of respect around here. They love me around here. I'm a swell guy. You're a lying sack of shit and everybody knows it. Oh, you're a tough guy. Hey c'mon. Get on your feet pal. Let's find out how tough you are. I wanna know right now how tough you are.
Just take the first shot. I'm begging you, take a shot. Just one hit. Come on, that's all I need, just one swing...
That's what I thought. You're a gutless turd.
You think he's funny? You think this is cute? You think he's ""bitchin,"" is that it? Let me tell you something. Look at him - he's a bum. You want to see something funny? You go visit John Bender in five years. You'll see how goddamned funny he is.
You ought to spend a little more time trying to make something of yourself and a little less time trying to impress people.
What did you wanna be when you were young?
When I was a kid, I wanted to be John Lennon.
Carl, don't be a goof. I'm making a serious point here.
Don't mess with the bull, young man. You'll get the horns.
You think about this: when you get old, these kids - when *I* get old - they're going to be running the country.
Yeah.
Now this is the thought that wakes me up in the middle of the night. That when I get older, these kids are going to take care of me.
I wouldn't count on it.
Why is that door closed? WHY IS THAT DOOR CLOSED?"
Ed Rooney,W,Dean Bitterman,"Ed Rooney.
Ed. This is George Peterson.
How are you today, sir?
Well, we've had a bit of bad luck this morning as you may have heard.
Yeah I heard, and man, I'm all broken up, boy, what a blow.
Yeah. Yeah. Well, uh, it's been a tough morning and we got a lot of family business to take care of, so if you wouldn't mind excusing Sloane, I'd appreciate it.
Uh, yeah, sure, no I'd be happy to, yeah you, uh, you you just produce a corpse, and uh, I'll release Sloane. I wanna see this dead grandmother first hand.
Ed?
It's alright, Grace, it's Ferris Bueller the little twerp. I'm gonna set a trap and let him fall right in it.
Ooh!
I'm sorry, Ed, did you say you wanted to see a body?
Yeah, that's right, just, uh, roll her old bones on over here, and I'll dig up your daughter. You know that's school policy.
Oh.
Was this your mother?
Uh, no my wife's mother.
Ed Rooney's office.
Hi this is Ferris Bueller, can I speak to Mr. Rooney please? Thank you.
Uh... hold.
Tell ya what, dipshit. If you don't like my policies you can come on down here and smooch my big ole' white butt.
ED!
Pucker up butter-cup.
What?
Ferris Bueller's on line 2.
So THAT's how it is in their family...
Les jeux sont faits. Translation: the game is up. Your ass is mine.
Are you also aware, Mrs. Bueller, that Ferris does not have what we consider to be an exemplary attendance record?
I don't understand.
He has missed an unacceptable number of school days. In the opinion of this educator, Ferris is not taking his academic growth seriously. Now I've spent my morning examining his records. If Ferris thinks that he can just coast through this month and still graduate, he is sorely mistaken. I have no reservations whatsoever about holding him back another year.
This is all news to me.
It usually is. So far this semester he has been absent nine times.
Nine times?
Nine times.
I don't remember him being sick nine times.
That's probably because he wasn't sick. He was skipping school. Wake up and smell the coffee, Mrs. Bueller. It's a fool's paradise. He is just leading you down the primrose path.
I can't believe it.
I've got it right here in front of me. He has missed nine days...
I asked for a car, I got a computer. How's that for being born under a bad sign?
What's the score?
Nothin' nothin'.
Who's winning?
The Bears.
We can't come to the phone right now. We've had a... death in the family.
Grace, Ferris Bueller is behind this. There is no doubt in my mind, and now, he's got Sloane Peterson involved in this thing.
Her grandmother, too.
You pinhead.
If you need to reach us, we'll be at the following number...
I did not achieve this position in life by having some snot-nosed punk leave my cheese out in the wind.
Ahem... Mr. Peterson?
Uhum!
Uhhm... you know, I-I think I owe you an apology, sir.
Well I should say you do!
I, uh... I-I-I...
Well, I think you should be sorry, for Christ's sake! A family member dies, and you insult me, what the hell's the matter with you, anyway?
Uh-uh-uh, well I, you...
... I-I really don't know, sir, I mean, I didn't think I was talking to you, I thought I was talking to somebody else, you know sir, I would never deliberately insult you like that, I-I can't begin to tell you how embarrassed I am!
Pardon my French... but you're an asshole!

Asshole!
Uhh, you're absolutely right, sir, you've hit the nail right on the head!
This isn't over yet Buster, do you read me?
I'm very sorry, Mr. Peterson...
Call me sir! Goddamn it!
I don't trust this kid any further than I can throw him.
Well, with your bad knee Ed, you shouldn't throw anybody... It's true.
What is so dangerous about a character like Ferris Bueller is he gives good kids bad ideas.
Mmm-hmm.
Last thing I need at this point in my career is fifteen hundred Ferris Bueller disciples running around these halls. He jeopardizes my ability to effectivley govern this student body.
Well, makes you look like an ass is what he does, Ed.
Thank you, Grace. I think you're wrong.
Oh, he's very popular Ed. The sportos, the motorheads, geeks, sluts, bloods, wastoids, dweebies, dickheads - they all adore him. They think he's a righteous dude.
That is why I have got to catch him this time- To show these kids the example he sets is a first class ticket to nowhere!
Oh, Ed, you sounded like Dirty Harry just then.
Really?
Uh-huh
Thanks, Grace.
Between grief and nothing... I'll take grief.
Great.
I don't trust this kid any further than I can throw him.
Well with your bad knee Ed, you shouldn't throw anybody... Its true.
Come here doggy! Look what Uncle Ed's got for you, you little fucker!
Oh, Ed. You just sounded like Dirty Harry just then.
Really? Thanks, Grace.
How would you feel about another *year* of high school? Under my close personal supervision."
Mr. Nolan,W,Dean Bitterman,"O Captain! My Captain!
Sit down, Mr. Anderson! Do you hear me? Sit down! Sit down! This is your final warning, Anderson. How dare you? Do you hear me?
O Captain! My Captain!
Mr. Overstreet, I warn you! Sit down!
Sit down! Sit down. All of you. I want you seated. Sit down. Leave, Mr. Keating. All of you, down. I want you seated. Do you hear me? Sit down!
Thank you, boys. Thank you.
Free thinkers at 17?
I always thought the idea of education was to learn to think for yourself.
At these boys' age? Not on your life!
Mr. Keating! They made everybody sign it.
Quiet, Mr. Anderson.
You gotta believe me. It's true.
I do believe you, Todd.
Leave, Mr. Keating.
But it wasn't his fault!
Sit down, Mr. Anderson! One more outburst from you or anyone else, and you're out of this school! Leave, Mr. Keating."
Dean Richmond,W,Dean Bitterman,"I assure you, I will not let you down.
You won't. I know you won't. As a matter of fact, I know you're going to be perfect! Do you know how I know all these things? I know them because if you're *not* perfect, nevermind the yelling, the screaming and the firing. If anything goes wrong, for any reason
I'm going to kill you. And I don't mean that as a euphemism, I am going to literally kill you. I'm going to strangle you and choke off your air supply until you pass away.
Comfy?

I sucked your brother's cock.
You sucked my brother's cock?
Yeah, I sucked his cock. I sucked all their cocks - what do you want me to tell you?
His fucking cock is bigger than yours.
Did you fuck my wife?
What?
Did you fuck my wife?
How do you ask me that? I'm your brother and you ask me that? Where do you get you're balls big enough to ask me that?
You're very smart, Joey. You're giving me a lot of answers, but you ain't giving me the right answer. I'm gonna ask you again: did you or did you not?
I'm not gonna answer that. It's stupid. It's a sick question and you're a sick fuck and I'm not that sick that I'm gonna answer it. I'm leaving, If Nora calls tell her I went home. I'm not staying in this nuthouse with you. You're a sick bastard, I feel sorry for you, I really do. You know what you should do? Try a little more fucking and a little less eating, so you won't have problems upstairs in the bedroom and you pick on me and everybody else. You understand me, you fucking wacko? You're cracking up! Fucking screw ball ya!
Don't give me that look, Joey. I gotta accept your answer, you know? But If I hear anything, I swear on our mother I'm gonna kill somebody. I'm gonna kill somebody, Joey.
Well go ahead and kill if you're a tough guy, go kill people! Kill Vicki, kill Salvy, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it, what do I care? You kill yourself, the way you eat! Ya fat fuck, look at you!
What do you mean - I don't understand, kill you?
Me! Kill me, start here! Do me a fuckin' favour! Cause you're driving me crazy! You're a killer, you're a big shot, just kill. You're a killer.
Come on, hit me. Harder. Harder.
What the fuck do you want? That's hard. What are you trying to prove?
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
What?
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
Jack. Jack, don't start your shit. I mean it, don't start.
Hey Jack, I just explained the whole thing to you didn't I. It was between me and Salvy. If it had anything to do with Vicki I would've told you about it.
That's not what I heard Joey.
What do you mean that's not what you heard?
That's not what I heard.
What did you hear?
I heard some things.
You heard about me and Salvy.
I heard things Joey.
Yeah you heard that I cracked Salvy all around. What did you hear?
I heard things Joey. I heard things.
What things you heard?
I heard some things.
She ain't the kind of girl you just fuck and forget about, this girl.
Joey, how many times I gotta tell ya? Why're you always cursin' when I'm talkin' to you? Don't do it around me. Do it around your friends.
She's a, the kind of girl you bang and forget about - she's not like that. You gotta spend time with her, get involved, you know...
D'you bang her?
No.
Tell me the truth.
I just told you the truth. I tell you the truth the first time. You don't have to ask me again. I never do that. I always tell you the truth. If I did it, you would know. I took her out a couple of times.
You went out with her and you didn't try to fuck her?
I try to fuck anything.
I got these small hands. I got a little girl's hands.
She says he's pretty.
Yeah, well, you make him ugly.
You punch like you take it up the ass.
Who's an animal? Your mother's an animal, ya son of a bitch.
Is it done?
No, it's not done.
Don't overcook it. You overcook it, it's no good. It defeats its own purpose.
What are you doin'? I just said don't overcook it. You're overcookin' it, bring it over.
You want your steak?
Bring it over. Bring it over! It's like a piece of charcoal! Bring it over here!
You want your steak?
YEAH, RIGHT NOW!
Okay. There's your stupid steak. Can't wait for it to be done?

Bodder me abott a steak? Huh?
That's GREAT!
YOU BODDA ME ABOTT A STEAK?
YEAH!
They only gave him that fuckin' decision because he's goin' in the Army next week. That's the only reason.
I knocked him down. I don't know what else I gotta do. I don't know what I gotta do...
You won and they robbed ya! They're miserable because their mothers take it up the fuckin' ass! That's why.
I've done a lot of bad things, Joey. Maybe it's comin' back to me. Who knows? I'm a jinx maybe. Who the hell knows?
Yeah, he's a nice kid, pretty kid, don't know whether to fuck him or fight him.
I get ya's both in the ring, I'll give ya both a fuckin' beatin', ya both can fuck each other.
I heard things.
Friends. They're in a huddle. Big business meeting. By the pool, they sit around and talk. Big deals. They make sure she can hear. Big Man. Get the fuck outta here. Big shot. Get 'em all in a back room, smack 'em around, no more big shot, without his gun. They're tough guys. They're all tough guys.
I'm gonna open his hole like this. Please excuse my French. I'm gonna make him suffer. I'm gonna make his mother wish she never had him - make him into dog meat... He's a nice, a nice kid. He's a pretty kid, too. I mean I don't know, I gotta problem if I should fuck him or fight him.
You're crazy. Fuck him or fight him.
If you're really in love with that fucker, just watch out.
By who?
Janiro.
You mean, you want me to get him to fuck you?
Me?
Yeah.
No, I don't want him to fuck me.
I could do that easily.
How ya gonna do that?
Because I'll get youse both in a ring, I'll give youse both a fuckin' beatin', ya both can fuck each other.

You're used to that.

Sir Alfred De Carter,T,Crazy Jealous Guy,"Have you ever heard of Russian Roulette?
Why, certainly. I used to play it all the time with my father.
I doubt that you played Russian Roulette all the time with your father!
Oh, I most certainly did. You play it with two decks of cards, and...
That's Russian Bank. Russian Roulette's a very different amusement which I can only wish your father had played continuously before he had you!
A thousand poets dreamed a thousand years, then you were born, my love.
I give you my solemn word, August: if I don't regain control of myself in a few minutes, concert or no concert, I'll take this candelabrum and beat that walnut you use for a head into a nutburger, I believe they're called!
Well, August, what happy updraft wafts you hither?
There's nothing wrong with me that a couple of magnums of Champagne won't cure!
A thousand poets dreamed a thousand years, and you were born, my love."
Heathcliff,T,Crazy Jealous Guy,"Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest so long as I live on! I killed you. Haunt me, then! Haunt your murderer! I know that ghosts have wandered on the Earth. Be with me always. Take any form, drive me mad, only do not leave me in this dark alone where I cannot find you. I cannot live without my life! I cannot die without my soul.
Why are your eyes always empty? Like Linton's eyes.
They're not empty, if you'd only look deeper. Look at me. I'm pretty. I'm a woman and I love you. You're all of life to me. Let me be a single breath of it for you.
I cannot live without my life! I cannot die without my soul!
Are you enjoying yourself, Heathcliff?
I've had the pleasure of watching you.
You're very grand, Heathcliff. So handsome. Looking at you tonight I could not help but remember how things used to be.
They used to be better.
Don't pretend life hasn't improved for you.
Life has ended for me.
How can you stand here beside me and pretend not to remember? Not to know that my heart is breaking for you? That your face is the wonderful light burning in all this darkness?
Heathcliff, no. I forbid it.
Do you forbid what your heart is saying to you now?
It's saying nothing.
I can hear it louder than the music. Oh, Cathy. Cathy.
I'm not the Cathy that was. Can you understand that? I'm somebody else. I'm another man's wife, and he loves me. And I love him.
If he loved you with all the power of his soul for a whole lifetime he couldn't love you as much as I do in a single day. Not he. Not the world. Not even you, Cathy, can come between us.
Heathcliff, you must go away. You must leave this house and never come back to it. I never want to see your face again or listen to your voice again as long as I live.
You lie! Why do you think I'm here tonight? Because you willed it. You willed me here across the sea.
If he loved you with all the power of his soul for a whole lifetime, he couldn't love you as much as I do in a single day.
If you ever looked at me once with what I know is in you, I'd be your slave. Cathy, if your heart were only stronger than your dull fear of God and the world, I'd live contented, silently in your shadow. But No. You must destroy us both with that weakness you call virtue.
Heathcliff, make the world stop right here. Make everything stop and stand still and never move again. Make the moors never change and you and I never change.
The moors and I will never change. Don't you, Cathy.
I can't. I can't. No matter what I ever do or say, Heathcliff, this is me now; standing on this hill with you. This is me forever.
It would be dreadful if Hindley ever found out.
Found out what? That you talk to me once in a while?
I shouldn't talk to you at all. Look at you! You get worse every day. Dirty and unkempt and in rags. Why aren't you a man? Heathcliff, why don't you run away?
Run away? From you?
You could come back to me rich and take me away. Why aren't you my prince like we said long ago? Why can't you rescue me, Heathcliff?
Cathy, come with me now!
Where?
Anywhere!
And live in haystacks and steal our food from the marketplaces? No, Heathcliff. That's not what I want.
You just want to send me off. That won't do. I've stayed here and been beaten like a dog. Abused and cursed and driven man, but I stayed just to be near you. Even as a dog! And I'll stay till the end. I'll live and I'll die under this rock!
Go on, Heathcliff. Run away. Bring me back the world.
Pack this fellow off.
I'm going. I'm going from here and from this cursed country both.
Throw him out!
But I'll be back in this house one day, Judge Linton and I'll pay you out. I'll bring this house down in ruins about your heads. That's my curse on you!
On all of you!
I want to crawl to her feet, whimper to be forgiven... for loving me. For needing her more than my own life... for belonging to her more than my own soul.
My tears don't love you, Cathy. They blight and curse and damn you!
Heathcliff, don't break my heart.
Oh Cathy, I never broke your heart. You broke it!
Well, what brought about this amazing transformation? Did you discover a gold mine in the New World, or perhaps you fell heir to a fortune?
The truth is I remembered that my father was an emperor of China and my mother was an Indian queen, and I went out and claimed my inheritance. It all turned out just as you once suspected, Cathy: that I had been kidnapped by wicked sailors and brought to England; that I was of noble birth.
Did Joseph see which way you came?
What does it matter? Nothing's real down there. Our life is here.
Yes, milord.
You could come back to me rich and take me away. Why aren't you my prince like we said long ago? Why can't you rescue me Heathcliff?
Cathy, come with me now.
Where?
Anywhere.
And live in haystacks and steal our food from the marketplaces? No Heathcliff, that's not what I want.
You just want to send me off. That won't do. I've stayed here and been beaten like a dog, abused and cursed and driven mad, but I stayed just to be near you, even as a dog. And I'll stay 'til the end. I'll live and I'll die under this rock.
Tell the dirty stable boy to let go of you. He soiled your pretty dress. But who soiled your heart? Not Heathcliff. Who turns you into a vain, cheap, worldly fool? Linton does. You'll never love him, but you'll let yourself be loved because it pleases your stupid, greedy vanity."
Alisdair Stewart,T,Crazy Jealous Guy,"Where's your mother? Where's she off to?
TO HELL!
She said, ""I have to go, let me go, let Baines take me away, let him try and save me. I am frightened of my will, of what it might do, it is so strange and strong"".
She says its her piano and she won't have him touch it. He's an oaf. He can't read. He's ignorant.
He wants to improve himself. And you'll be able to play it. Teach him how to look after it. You can't go on like this. We're a family now. We all make sacrifices and so will you! You will teach him and I will see to it!
What would you think if someone played a kitchen table like it were a piano?
Like it were a piano?
It's strange isn't it? I mean it's not a piano, it doesn't make any sound.
No, no sound.
I knew she was mute, but now I'm thinking it's more than that. I'm wondering if she's not brain affected.
No sound at all?
No, it was a table.
I'd like to make a swap.
What for?
The piano.
Can you hear me?
What do you think?
She looks tired.
She's stunted, thats one thing.
She has spoken to me. I heard her voice. There was no sound, but I heard it here. Her voice was there in my head. I watched her lips, they did not make the words, yet the harder I listened the clearer I heard her, as clear as I hear you, as clear as I hear my own voice.
Do you love him? Do you? IS IT HIM YOU LOVE?
No! She says NOOOOOO!

Mother! Mamma!
I know why Mr. Baines can't play the piano. She never gives him a turn. She just plays whatever she pleases and sometimes she doesn't play at all.
And when is the next lesson?
Tomorrow.
I trusted you.
This means goodnight."
Dr. Stephen Fleming,T,Crazy Jealous Guy,"It takes a remarkably short time to withdraw from the world. I traveled... until I arrived at a life of my own. What really makes us is beyond grasping. It's way beyond knowing. We give in to love... because it gives us some sense of what is unknowable. Nothing else matters, not at the end.
What would you win by leaving Ingrid?
You. I'd win you.
Then you'd win something you already have.
I want you.
I know.
I saw her once more only. I saw her by accident at an airport, changing planes. She didn't see me. She was with Peter. She was holding a child. She was no different from anyone else.
What happened?
The pain was unbearable. I was beating myself.
I can't see past you.
I don't think you've ever seen much of anything.
You must understand, this is a wonderful chance for Anna to get a fresh start in life.
I'm not sure I know what you mean.
Yes you do. I watched you at lunch. You didn't dare to look at her.
All through dinner, I had one thought, one desire. To touch you. To hold you."
Otto,T,Crazy Jealous Guy,"You pompous, stuck-up, snot-nosed, English, giant, twerp, scumbag, fuck-face, dickhead, asshole.
How very interesting. You're a true vulgarian, aren't you?
You are the vulgarian, you fuck.
Don't call me stupid.
Why on earth not?
Oh, you English are *so* superior, aren't you? Well, would you like to know what you'd be without us, the good ol' U.S. of A. to protect you? I'll tell you. The smallest fucking province in the Russian Empire, that's what! So don't call me stupid, lady. Just thank me.
Well, *thank* you for popping in and protecting us.
If it wasn't for us, you'd all be speaking *German!* Singing ""Deutschland, Deutschland über alles...""
Asshole!
All right, all right, I apologise.
You're really sorry.
I'm really really sorry, I apologise unreservedly.
You take it back.
I do, I offer a complete and utter retraction. The imputation was totally without basis in fact, and was in no way fair comment, and was motivated purely by malice, and I deeply regret any distress that my comments may have caused you, or your family, and I hereby undertake not to repeat any such slander at any time in the future.
OK.
You know your problem? You don't like winners.
Winners?
Yeah. Winners.
Winners, like North Vietnam?
Shut up. We didn't lose Vietnam. It was a tie!
I'm tellin' ya baby, they kicked your little ass there. Boy, they whooped yer hide REAL GOOD.
I'm, uh, Harvey. Manfred... jen... sen... den.
Rev-enge!
It's K-K-K-Ken! C-c-c-coming to k-k-k-kill me! How you gonna c-c-c-catch me, K-K-K-Ken?
You're a very attractive man, Ken. You're... smart, you've got wonderful bones, great eyes, and you dress really interestingly.
What you...?
We could have a lot of fun together, you and I. And I think we'd be really good for each other. What do you say?
You must be j-j-j...
May I kiss you, Ken?
No, you fucking can't!
What about my tits?
Does he get to handle them?
Yes, he does. That's my forecast and I'll stand by it.
Would this also involve... nuzzling?
Yes, I think three million dollars is worth a bit of nuzzling. Fifty percent chance of that.
Sucking?
I thought you weren't jealous?
I'm not. I don't believe in jealousy, it's for the weak. One thing though. Touch his dick and he's dead!
Oh, I'm so very, very, very ssssssssssss... FUCK YOU!
Don't call me stupid!
Hello, Mr. Burglar! Going somewhere? Thought you could rob Mr. Leach, eh? Well, I'm going to teach you a lesson!
He just happens to be a very good friend of mine!
Otto! Otto! Otto!
And he's going to be very pleased with me to find you here, all tied up and ready for the police!
And don't call me ""Otto."" To you, I am ""Mr...""
Oh, my God... Oh... Oh my God. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Please, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I didn't know it was you. How could I know it was you? I mean, how could you expect me to guess? Stupid jerk! I mean, what the fuck were you doing *robbing* your *own house?*
You asshole! You stupid, stiff, pompous, English...!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry. Uh... uh... yeah.
Aisle or window, smoking or non?
What was the part in the middle?
I love watching your ass when you walk. Is that beautiful or what? Don't go near him, he's mine.
I used to box for Oxford.
Oh, yeah?
I used to kill for the CIA.
I want you to know something Otto.
What?
Even if you were my brother I'd still want to fuck you.
You really like animals don't you, Ken? What's the attraction.
Well, you can t-t-trust them and they don't sh-sh-sh-sh
Shit on you?
Show off all the t-time.
When you say ""friendly"", what are we talking about here? Cordial? Courteous? Supportive? What?
I don't know. Let's just see what happens.
So, ""friendly"" might include actual... what, penetration?
What does he want you to do? Send her flowers? Do her shopping? Show her a good time? Rub her out? Rub her out?
HE'S GOING TO KILL HER! HA HA HA!
Shut up!
Fuck off or I'll kill you. LIMEY FRUITS! So the old lady's gonna m-m- meet with an accident, eh K-K-Ken?
Shh!
What's - what's so funny?
Nothing, it's just that wasting old ladies isn't NICE!
Well it's better than b-b-buggering people!
I'll bet you a pound you don't kill her.
Alright.
Alright. I love watching your ass when you walk! Is that beautiful or what? Don't go near him! He's mine! A pound says you won't kill her! Ha ha!
I'm here because I'm bored. Bored hanging around this God-awful city. Shoving George's ugly pic... Talking to a lot of snotty, stuck up, intellectual British faggots. Jesus they're uptight they get rigor mortis in the prime of life in this country, standing there with their hair clenched.
Just, counting the seconds to the weekends so they can all dress up like ballerinas and whip themselves into a frenzy at the flat at 4. 2B St.
To be honest I hate them. I mean pretending they're so fucking lawyer.
superior, so fucking superior with those phony accents.
Not you Ken, you have a beautiful speaking voice... when it works.
Son of a bitch!
So, wanna have some lunch?
Have you heard from him?
Who?
Archie.
No I have to finish my hair!
No.
Nothing?
Ok well I'm outta here!
No plans to see him?
No.
Ok. Bye Bro.
Bye Wanda!
Oh Sorry.
Don't call me stupid.
Why on earth not?
What have you found out?
Not a lot.
You realise he's in court tomorrow?
I know. I know that!
So nothing, huh?
Nix! Zip! Diddly! Bupkis!
Niente!
Pork away pal. Fuck her blue.
Avoid the green ones. They're not ripe yet.
So the old lady's gonna m-m-m-meet with an accident eh K-K-K-K-Ken?
What is this? ""Hump a Limey"" week?
Get the fuck out of here, Otto.
Relax. I heard moaning; I was worried.
Ok... Ok... DISAPPOINTED. Son of a bitch. What do you have to do in this world to make people trust you?
Shut up.
People are always taking advantage of me.
Shut up and think.
What are you doing?
I'm thinking.
I love robbing the English, they're so polite.
I used to box for Oxford.
Oh, yeah? Well...
...I used to kill for the CIA.
How could a bright and smart girl like you have a brother who is so...
Don't call me stupid!
Ken! Ken! Wait, wait, Ken! Kenny! I... may I call you Kenny?
Remember Wanda!
I got the deal of a lifetime! Fifty-fifty, you and me, what do you say! Okay, okay, okay, sixty-forty! That's my final offer!
REVENGE!
Wait, I got an idea! You take it all! Yeah, here's my boarding pass, Ken!
I'm gonna, I'm gonna k-ka, kill you!
Okay, fine, Ken! Come at me, give me your best shot! Go on, Ken! You don't have the guts, admit it!
Okay, you have the guts, good... wait!
Death!
Okay, I'm-sorry-I-ate-your-fish, okay? I'm-sorry!
Revenge!
Jesus, I said I'm sorry! What the fu-?
AAAAHHHH!
Got him!
Nice fish, Ken. You know what Nietzsche said about animals? ""They were God's second blunder.""
Well, you t-t-t-tell him from me that I kuh-kuh, I kuh-kuh...
Hello, K-K-K-Ken's p-p-pets!
Wake up!
Wake up Limey fish!
So... how are you going to get friendly with this lawyer?
I don't know - I'll improvise.
Fucking insects!
Shit! Fucking Limey cement.
You spineless bimbo.
Touch his dick, and he's dead!
You're going to shoot me?
Yep, 'fraid so, ol' chap! Sorry!
What about my tits?
Does he get to handle them?
Yes. That's my forecast. I'll stand by that.
Let's get the diamonds!"
Frank N. Furter,T,Crazy Jealous Guy,"I grow weary of this world! When shall we return to Transylvania, huh?
Magenta, I am indeed grateful to you and your brother Riff Raff. You have both served me well. You will discover that when the mood takes me... I can be quite generous.
I ask for nothing, master.
And you shall receive it. IN ABUNDANCE!
I'll tell you once, I won't tell you twice, you better wise up, Janet Weiss. Your apple pie don't taste too nice. You better wise up, Janet Weiss."
David McCall,T,Crazy Jealous Guy,"It could of all been different, Mr. Walker. You should have allowed nature to take its course. In the end, it will anyway.
SO LET ME IN THE FUCKIN' HOUSE!
Just you and me Nicole, nobody else.
Nobody else
Do you want me?
Yes.
Tell me, tell me you want me.
I want you David.
Yeah?
David?
Yeah?
I love you.
You're not dancing.
I know.
David, I don't want to beat around the bush. I came to tell you that you're gonna stop seeing Nicole. Now, either you're as smart as you think you are and you'll just go away, or else you're gonna make things a lot harder on yourself than they have to be.
You know, Steve, you're really not a faggot.
...What?
No, I'm serious. You seem like a pretty solid guy; you should lighten up on yourself.
We're not talkin' about me, we're talkin'...
Yes we are. That's what this whole thing's about, Steve. Your inadequacies. Your fears.
You just wait a minute...
Listen to me. See, I'm hip to your problems. All of 'em. I know you abandoned Nicole when she needed you most... 'cause I licked her sweet tears. I know about things comin' apart at work. Maybe you fuckin' lost it in that department. I also know you ain't keepin' up, so to speak, your end of the bargain with the missus. 'Cause if you were she wouldn't be all over my stick. Relax, Steve. We're friends. We're practically family.
I want you to understand somethin', pal. If you don't disappear from my family's life, I'm gonna rip your balls off and shove 'em so far up your ass they'll come out your fuckin' mouth! You got that, my friend?
Isn't this the car they stopped making 'cause it, I don't know, blows up or something?
Guess that's why I got her.
Hey Mr. Walka!
Daddy, you will forever hold your peace.
Oh, no you don't.
... I've spent my whole life taking the easy way out, David. Now, IT'S YOUR TURN!
... Dad, are you all right?
... I didn't abandon you this time.
... I wanted to save David from himself, in spite of everything. I'm sorry I couldn't.
Well, I didn't do so hot either, not on that score... But I think we BOTH did the next best thing, don't you?
Touché, Dad.
Nicole, get me a Coke.
You filthy little whore!"
Bud White,T,Crazy Jealous Guy,"If we're going to figure this out, we need to work together.
The Nite Owl made you. You want to tear all that down?
With a wrecking ball. You want to help me swing it?
You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.
You look better than Veronica Lake.
You'll do as I say, and ask no questions. Do you follow my drift?
In technicolor, sir.
I'd like to see you again.
Are you asking me for a date, or an appointment?
...I don't know.
Well, if you're asking me for a date, I should know your first name.
Forget I asked. It was a mistake.
You say ""fuck"" a lot.
You fuck for money.
A naked man with a gun? Do you really expect anyone to believe that?
Get the fuck away from me.
How's it gonna look in your report?
It'll look like justice. That's what the man got. Justice.
You don't know the meaning of the word, you ignorant bastard.
Oh yeah, well you think it means getting your picture in the paper. Why don't you go after criminals for a change, instead of cops?
Stensland got what he deserved, and so will you.
It's best to stay away from a man when his blood is up.
His blood is always up.
Then perhaps you should stay away from him altogether.
Maybe I will. Maybe I won't.
LAPD, shitbird. Get the fuck outta here or I'll call your wife to come get you!
Officer.
Councilman.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas to you, officer.
That obvious, huh?
It's practically stamped on your forehead.
All I ever wanted was to measure up to my father.
Now's your chance.
He died in the line of duty, didn't he?
Something's wrong with the Nite Owl. I know it in here,
I know it. That prick Exley shot the wrong guys. Whoever killed my partner, is still out there. I... If I could work cases like a real detective, I could prove it. But I'm not smart enough. I'm just the guy they bring in to scare the other guy shitless.
You're wrong. You found Patchett, you found me. You're smart enough.
Unless you came here to wipe my ass, I believe we're through.
Come on, don't try that ""Good Cop-Bad Cop"" crap. I practically invented it. So what if some homo actor is dead, huh? Boys, girls, ten of them step off the bus to L.A. every day...
Pull him off me, Exley!
I don't know how.
Now, I know you think you're the A-number one hotshot. But here's the juice: if I take you out, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow. They just won't come on the bus, that's all!
Was that how you used to run the ""Good Cop-Bad Cop""?
Who in the hell are you?
The ghost of Christmas past. Why don't you dance with a man for a change?
What are you, some kind of smart ass?
You'll be out in a year and a half. I'll get cozy with your parole officer. You touch her again, I'll have you violated on a kiddie raper beef.
You know what they do to kiddie rapers in Quentin, don't ya?
I got a hot date.
Yeah? Who is she and what did you arrest her for?
I use girls that look like movie stars. Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon. When the work had been done, that's when you saw us.
That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her. Jesus fucking Christ.
No, Mr. White. Pierce Morehouse Patchett. Now I sense that you're on your best behavior, but that's really all you're going to get. If you have any more questions, I'll meet you with my attorney.
Bullshit. How would a two-bit hick like Meeks get his hands on a large supply of heroin?
You're right, it's probably bullshit. Even if he did, he could never unload it. Not without drawing all kinds of attention.
Maybe that's why he's under a house in Elysian Park and he don't smell too good, paisano.
Don't ever try to fucking bribe me or I'll have you and Patchett in shit up to your ears.
Where did this come from?
When I was twelve, my old man went after my mother with a bottle. I got in the way.
So you saved her.
...Not for long.
I'm sorry, it's none of my business...
He tied me to the radiator. I watched him beat my mother to death with a tire iron. Then he left me there. Three days before a truant officer found us... They never found the old man.
Is that why you became a cop? To get even?
...Maybe.
What do I get if I give you your balls back, you wop cocksucker?
What happened?
Somebody beat him to death and stole a bunch of files. Must've dug up garbage on the wrong guy. Got it narrowed down to a thousand suspects.
Bud White - what brings *you* to the basement?
I got a couple Nite Owl questions.
I don't know if you'd read the papers, but that case is closed.
Is there anything bothering you about it, Ray?
Yeah, the fact that the pack-up boys haven't carted this shit out of here yet.
I got three shotguns, taken from the suspects, that match the strike marks on the shells from the Nite Owl. What more do you want?
There's blood on the wall here. I thought everybody but the cook got shot in the men's room?
That is Stensland's blood.
Stensland?
He took a blow to the head. Was probably unconscious when they dragged him in the john.
Did they hit anybody else?
No. But he was a cop, he probably tried to ""do something.""
Grilled cheese, black coffee... two of the victims were women, right?
Yeah - Patti DeLuca, the night-shift waitress, and a Susan Lefferts.
Susan Lefferts...
Yeah, what about her?
You're welcome!
There's blood on your shirt. Is that an integral part of your job?
Yeah.
Do you enjoy it?
When they deserve it.
Did they deserve it?
I'm not sure.
But you did it anyway.
Yeah, just like the half-dozen guys you screwed today.
Well, actually, it was only two.
I was wondering when you'd knock on my door again, Officer White.
It's Bud.
Bud...
We'll do the town one night... on me.
I'll bring my wallet, just in case.
There's no god damn bill on me?
Four of the witnesses recanted their testimony.
Why?
They had a change of heart.
What about Stensland?
Your partner's through. Departmental scapegoat on the chief's orders.
A year from his pension. Exley.
Exley made his play and got what he wanted. As a politician, he exceeds even myself. The Department needs smart men like Exley... and direct men like you.
Pierce Patchett?
He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us. He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us. Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake.
No. I'm really a brunette, but the rest is me.
I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith and Pierce Patchett 24 hours a day. I want you to get a judge to authorize wiretaps on their home phones, and I want authorization to check their bank records.
On what evidence?
Call it a hunch.
Suicide note. Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running.
Slicing himself open wasn't his idea. Two of his fingers are broken.
Well, Captain, what do you want?
Call me Dudley.
Dudley... what do you want?"
Tony Montana,T,Crazy Jealous Guy,"You wanna fuck with me? Okay. You wanna play rough? Okay. Say hello to my little friend!
What you lookin' at? You all a bunch of fuckin' assholes. You know why? You don't have the guts to be what you wanna be? You need people like me. You need people like me so you can point your fuckin' fingers and say, ""That's the bad guy."" So... what that make you? Good? You're not good. You just know how to hide, how to lie. Me, I don't have that problem. Me, I always tell the truth. Even when I lie. So say good night to the bad guy! Come on. The last time you gonna see a bad guy like this again, let me tell you. Come on. Make way for the bad guy. There's a bad guy comin' through! Better get outta his way!
I always tell the truth. Even when I lie.
I'm Tony Montana! You fuck with me, you fuckin' with the best!
The only thing in this world that gives orders... is balls.
This is paradise, I'm tellin' ya. This town like a great big pussy just waiting to get fucked.
I never fucked anybody over in my life didn't have it coming to them. You got that? All I have in this world is my balls and my word and I don't break them for no one. Do you understand? That piece of shit up there, I never liked him, I never trusted him. For all I know he had me set up and had my friend Angel Fernandez killed. But that's history. I'm here, he's not. Do you wanna go on with me, you say it. You don't, then you make a move.
You know what? Fuck you! How about that?
You know what capitalism is? Getting fucked!
In this country, you gotta make the money first. Then when you get the money, you get the power. Then when you get the power, then you get the women.
You want to give me the cash, or do I kill your brother first, before I kill you?
Why don't you try sticking your head up your ass? See if it fits.
Me, I want what's coming to me.
Oh, well what's coming to you?
The world, chico, and everything in it.
Every dog has his day.
Go ahead! I take your fucking bullets! You think you kill me with bullets? I take your fucking bullets! Go ahead!
Tony, don't kill me, please!
I ain't gonna kill you.
Oh Christ, thank you! Thank you!
Manolo, shoot that piece of shit!
Who put this thing together? Me, that's who! Who do I trust? Me!
Is this it? That's what it's all about, Manny? Eating, drinking, fucking, sucking? Snorting? Then what? You're 50. You got a bag for a belly. You got tits, you need a bra. They got hair on them. You got a liver, they got spots on it, and you're eating this fuckin' shit, looking like these rich fucking mummies in here... Look at that. A junkie. I got a fuckin' junkie for a wife. She don't eat nothing. Sleeps all day with them black shades on. Wakes up with a Quaalude, and who won't fuck me 'cause she's in a coma. I can't even have a kid with her, Manny. Her womb is so polluted, I can't even have a fuckin' little baby with her!
Bet you feel good, huh? Bet you feel good to kill a mother and her kids, huh, bet you feel *big*...
Shut your mouth!
...Like, you big man. Well, fuck you. What do you think I am? You think I'd kill two kids and a woman? Fuck that! I don't need that shit in my life.
You die, motherfucker!
What'd you think of that, huh? What you think, I'm a fucking worm like you? I told you, man, I told you! Don't fuck with me! I told you, no fucking kids! No, but you wouldn't listen, why, you stupid fuck, look at you now.
Okay Sosa; You wanna fuck with me? You fucking with the best! You wanna fuck with me? Okay. You little cockroaches... come on. You wanna play games? Okay, I play with you; come on. Okay. You wanna play rough? Okay. Say hello to my little friend!
You wanna waste my time? Okay. I call my lawyer. He's the best lawyer in Miami. He's such a good lawyer, that by tomorrow morning, you gonna be working in Alaska. So dress warm.
Hey, baby, what is your problem? Huh, you got a problem? You're good looking, you got a beautiful body, beautiful legs, beautiful face, all these guys in love with you. Only you got a look in your eye like you haven't been fucked in a year!
Hey, Jose. Who, why, when, and how I fuck is none of your business, okay?
So where's your old man now?
He dead. He die. Sometime. Somewhere.
Mother?
She dead too.
What kind of work you do in Cuba, Tony?
Ah, you know, things. I was, uh - This, that. Construction business. I work a lot with my hands. I was in the army.
Any family in the States, Tony? Any cousins, brother-in-law, anybody?
Nobody. Everybody's dead.
You ever been to jail, Tony?
Me? Jail? No way. No.
Been in a mental hospital?
Oh, yeah. On the boat coming over.
Okay, come on.
What about Ernie?
You want a job, Ernie?
Sure, Tony.
Manny, look at the pelican fly. Come on, pelican!
The World Is Yours!
Every dog has his day, huh, Mel?
I told him. It didn't make any sense, clipping you when we had you working for us. He wouldn't listen. He got hot tonight, about the broad, you know? He fucked up.
You too, Mel. You fucked up.
Don't go too far, Tony.
I not, Mel, you are.
Fuck. You can't shoot a cop!
Whoever says you was one?
Wait a minute! You let me go, I'll fix this up.
Sure, Mel. Maybe you can hand out yourself one of them first class tickets to the Resurrection.
Fucking punk. Son of a bitch.
So long, Mel, have a good trip.
Fuck you!
Chi Chi, get the yeyo.
Hey, Tony. Remember when I told you when you first started working for me, the guys that last in this business, are the guys who fly straight. Low-key, quiet. But the guys who want it all, chicas, champagne, flash... they don't last.
You finished? Can I go?
Yes, I'm finished.
Hey, Frank, you're a piece of shit.
What are you talking about?
You know what I'm taking about about, you fucking cockroach.
Okay, here's the story. I come from the gutter. I know that. I got no education... but that's okay. I know the street, and I'm making all the right connections. With the right woman, there's no stopping me. I could go right to the top.
You a communist? Huh? How'd you like it, man? They tell you all the time what to do, what to think, what to feel. Do you wanna be like a sheep? Like all those other people? Baah! Baah!
I don't have to listen to this bullshit!
You wanna work eight, ten fucking hours? You own nothing, you got nothing! Do you want a chivato on every corner looking after you? Watching everything you do? Everything you say, man? Do you know I eat octopus three times a day? I got fucking octopus coming out of my fucking ears. I got the fuckin' Russian shoes my feet's comin' through. How you like that? What, you want me to stay there and do nothing? Hey, I'm no fuckin' criminal, man. I'm no puta or thief. I'm Tony Montana, a political prisoner from Cuba. And I want my fuckin' human rights, now!
Just like the President Jimmy Carter says. Okay?
Carter should see this human right. He's really good. What do you say, Harry?
I don't believe a word of this shit! They all sound the same to me. That son of a bitch Castro is shittin' all over us. Send this bastard to Freedom Town. Let them take a look at him. Get him outta here.
You know somethin'? You can send me anywhere. Here, there, this, that; it don't matter. There's nothing you can do to me that Castro has not done.
Get him outta here!
Your guy Alberto... you know he's a piece of shit. I told him to do something he didn't listen to me, so I had to cancel his fucking contract.
My partners and I are pissed off Tony.
That's okay, no big deal. We do it next month.
No, Tony. You can't do that. They found what was under the car, Tony! Now, our friend has got security up the ass! And the heat is gonna come down hard on my partners and me... There's not gonna be a next time, you fucking dumb cocksucker! You blew it!
Hey! Take it easy when to talk to me, okay?
I told you a long time ago, you fucking little monkey, not to fuck me!
Hey, hey! Who the fuck you think you're talking to huh? You wanna fuck...
Who the fuck you think I am? Your fucking bell boy? Come on! Bring it! You wanna go to war? We take you to war! Okay?
You know what you're becoming, Tony? You're an immigrant spick millionaire, who can't stop talking about money...
Who the fuck you calling a spick, man? You white piece of bread. Get outta the way of the television.
Watch my back.
Better than your front, lemme tell you. Much easier to watch.
Can't you see what we're becoming, Tony? We're losers. We're not winners, we're losers.
Go home. You stoned.
I'm not stoned. You're stoned.
Another Quaalude, and she'll be mine again.
Would you kiss me if I wear the hat?
No.
I work hard for this. I want you to know that.
It's too bad. Somebody shouldv'e given it to you. You wouldv'e been a nicer person.
*Now* you're talking to me, baby.
Don't call me ""baby"". I'm not your ""baby"".
Okay, so what do you call yourself? ¿Cómo se llama?
Antonio Montana. And you, what you call yourself?
Where'd you learn to speak the English, Tony?
Uh, in a school. And my father, he was, uh, from the United States. Just like you, ya know? He was a Yankee. Uh, he used to take me a lot to the movies. I learn. I watch the guys like Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney. They, they teach me to talk. I like those guys. I always know one day I'm comin' here, United States.
What's with this dishwasher, chico?
Don't he think we could've got some other space cadet to hit Rebenga cheaper, too? Fifty bucks.
Then why didn't you? And don't be callin' me no fuckin' dishwasher, or I'll kick you fuckin' monkey ass!
So, you got the money?
Yep. You got the stuff?
Sure I have the stuff. I don't have it with me here right now. I have it close by.
Oh... well I don't have the money either. I have it close by too.
Where? Down in your car?
Uh... no. Not in the car.
No?
What about you? Where do you keep your stuff?
Not far.
I ain't getting the money unless I see the stuff first.
No, no. First the money, then the stuff.
Okay. You want me to come in and we start over again?
Where are you from, Tony?
What the fuck difference does that make on where I'm from?
Coño, Tony! I'm just asking just so I know who I'm doing business with.
Well, you can know about me when you stop fucking around and start doing business with me, Hector!
Son? I wish I had one! He's a bum! He was a bum then and he's a bum now! Who do you think you are, hm? We haven't heard a word from you in five years. Cinco anos. You suddenly show up here and you throw money at us? You think you can *buy* me with your money?
Come on, mama.
You think you can come in here with your hot-shot clothes and make fun of us?
Mama, you don't know what you're talking about.
No that is NOT the way I am, Antonio! That is *not* the way I raised Gina to be. You are not going to destroy her. I don't need your money. Gracias! I work for my living. *I don't want you in this house anymore!* I don't want you around Gina! So come on, get out! And take this lousy money with you! It stinks!
You know what your problem is, pussycat?
What is my problem, Tony?
You got nothing to do with your life, man. Why don't you get a job? Do something, be a nurse. Work with blind kids, lepurs, that kind of thing. Anything beats you waiting around all day, waiting for me to fuck you, I'll tell you that.
Don't toot your horn, honey, you're not that good.
Oh yeah? Frank was better huh?
You're an asshole.
Where are you going? COME HERE! Coño, HEY! ELVY! I was kidding. I WAS ONLY KIDDING!
I got ears, ya know. I hear things.
Yeah? What do you hear about Echevierra and the Diaz brothers? What about them? What about Gaspar Gomez? What is he gonna do when you start moving 2000 keys?
Fuck Gaspar Gomez! And fuck the fuckin' Diaz brothers! Fuck 'em all! I bury those cockroaches!
Look at that, a junkie... I got a junkie for a wife. Her womb is so polluted, I can't even have a fucking little baby with her!
C'mon, Tony.
You son of a bitch!... You fuck!
How dare you talk to me like that? What makes you so much better than me? What do you do?
Don't worry.
You deal drugs and you kill people. Oh, that's wonderful, Tony. Real contribution to human history.
Go ahead. Just tell everybody. Come on.
You want a kid?
Tell the world.
What kind of a father do you think you'd make?
Who's gonna drive him to school in the mornings? Are you even gonna be alive by the time the kid goes to school?
You don't even know how to be a husband!
Sit down before I...
Do we ever go anywhere without having 600 thugs hanging around us all the time?
I have Nick ""The Pig"" for a friend. What kind of a life is that?
Come on.
Can't you see... what we're becoming, Tony? We're losers. We're not winners.
Go home. You're stoned.
I'm not stoned. You're stoned.
Get her out of here!
Come on. Come on.
No! No! I'm not going home with you!
I'm not going home with anybody! I'm going home alone. I'm leaving you. I don't need this shit anymore.
Okay, I'll walk you out.
I'll take her home in a cab.
Let her go, let her go. Another Quaalude, she gonna love me again.
¡Ay, Dios mío! ¡Mira eso! Look at that one. That one right there in the pink. She's beautiful, man. Look at those titties.
Look at that punk with her. What's he got that I don't have?
Well, he's very handsome for one thing, you know?
I mean, look at the way he dresses, man. Come on. That's style. Flash, pizzazz. And a little coke money doesn't hurt nobody.
¡Coño! Look at this. Fuckin' onions. They oughta be pickin' gold from the street. ¡Ay, cabrón!
What you tell 'em?
I told 'em what you told me to tell 'em, I told 'em I was in sanitation. They didn't go for it.
Sanitation? I told you to tell 'em that you was in a sanitarium. Not sanitation, sanitarium.
I kill a communist for fun, but for a green card... I'm gonna carve him up real nice.
You know what your problem is?
What's that?
You don't got nothing to do with your life. Why don't you get a job? Work with lepers. Blind kids. Anything's gotta be better than lying around all day waiting for me to fuck you.
Don't toot your horn, honey. You're not that good.
What about homosexuality, Tony? You like men, huh? You like to dress up like a woman?
What the fuck is wrong with this guy, man? He kidding me or what?
Just answer the questions, Tony!
Okay. No. Okay? Fuck no!
I know that. But you know why, Vic? 'Cause you got your head up your culo. That's why that fucking guy never tells the truth. That motherfucker!
You think you can take me? You need a fucking army if you gonna take me!
Tony what happened?
Aww, Alex, we had some problems you know, your man he wouldn't listen to me so I had to cancel his fucking contract.
You know what a chazzer is?
No, Frank, you tell me. What is a chazzer?
It's a Yiddish word for ""pig."" See, the guy, he wants more than what he needs. He don't fly straight no more.
Hey, how'd you like that? Huh? You fuckin' maricón! Hey!
We are just going to do one deal and that's it!
Okay... fuck you. How's that?
Fuck you.
Fuck you!
Last chance, pendejo!
Fuck you!
¡Tony! ¡Montana! ¡Tony Montana! Ven acá, man. Come here.
¿Qué te pasa?
Come here, man. I gotta talk to you. Come on, man. It's important.
So close, man.
Come on. Come on, man. I gotta talk to you.
Where are you going, man?
Leave him alone, okay?
I got better things to do.
You're chicken, man. You almost made it.
Are you ready for some good news?
Sure. What you got, man?
We can be outta this place in 30 days. Not only that, but we got a green card and a job in Miami. Now are we made or are we made, man?
What do we gotta do? Go to Cuba and hit the beard or what?
No, man, somebody else.
You're kidding?
No.
You're not kidding?
Guy named Rebenga, man. Emilio Rebenga.
Rebenga? Coño, man. I know that name.
Yeah?
He's political.
Yeah. Well, he's coming in here today, man. Castro just sprung him. This guy, man, was one of the top dogs for Fidel in the early days. But Castro felt like he couldn't trust him anymore and threw him in jail. But while he was on top, he tortured a few guys to death. And one of the guy's brother is a rich guy in Miami now, and he wants the favor repaid. That's where we come in.
All right! All right, big man? You wanna make some big bucks? Lets see how tough you are. Do you know something 'bout cocaine?
You kidding me or what?
There's a bunch of Colombians coming in Friday. New guys. They say they have two keys for us, for openers. Pure coke. Hotel in Miami Beach. I want you go over there. If it's what they say it is, you pay 'em and bring it back. You do that, you get five grand!
Go, pay, bring it back, yeah?
You know how to handle a machine gun?
Yeah, man. We're in the army in Cuba.
You'll need a couple of other guys.
That's no problem, man.
Be at Hector's Bodega at noon Friday. You get the buy money then. And chico! If anything happens to that buy money, y pobreci! My boss is gonna stick your heads up your asses faster than a rabbit gets fucked!
I'm scared!
That prick. Fucking WASP whore. Thinking I'm some marìcon coming off a banana boat.
What would Frank say?
I like Frank, you know. Only I like you better.
Hey Tony, how's married life treating you?
Better than you are.
The fuckin' country was built on washing money.
I'm getting you a one way ticket to the resurrection.
Fuck you!
Where'd you get the beauty scar, tough guy? Eatin' pussy?
How'm I gonna get a scar like that eating pussy?
This was when I was a kid, ya know?
Mm-hmm.
You should see the other kid. You can't recognize him.
And this?
Oh, that's nothing, man. That's for my sweetheart.
Sweetheart, my ass! We've been seein' more and more of these. Some kind of code these guys used in the can. Pitchfork means an assassin or somethin'. You wanna tell us about it, Montana, or do you wanna take a little trip to the detention center?
Okay, you got me. I was in the can one time. For buying dollars. Big, big deal.
That's pretty funny, Tony.
Well, that's true. It was a Canadian tourist.
Hmm. What'd ya do? Mug him first?
You should have kept your mouth shut, they'd have thought you was a horse and let you out.
Hey, come on, man, it ain't that bad.
Hey, what the fuck you talkin', man?
The jails in this country are like hotels, man.
You fuckin' kiddin' me, man? Are you fuckin' high, man?
This town's like a great big chicken just waiting to be plucked.
You wanna waste my time, OK? You wanna play rough?
I didn't come to the United States to break my fucking back.
Now you're talking to me baby! That I like! Keep it coming!
What about that job we did for you in Freedom Town? The Rebenga hit... What was that? A game of dominoes, mang?
Look at that... that cable truck there. Since when does it take three days to hook up cable?
What, you've been watching it for three days?
The fuckin' thing has been there for three days! What am I gonna do? Not look at it?
You do so much of that shit, you know?
Nothing exceeds like excess. You should know that, Tony.
I should know what? *What should I know?* Why do you have to talk to me like that all the time? Like I gotta know something.
Don't fucking go crazy on me, okay? Just remember, this time last year we were in a fucking cage.
You remember. I like to forget that.
Yeah, it was a setup. Bunch of cowboys. Somebody fucked up somewhere. Fuckin' Columbians. They never wanted to make the sale. They only wanted to steal the money.
All right, I'll look into it right away. I'll make some inquiries and find out what happened.
Yeah, you do that, Omar! You do that.
Do you still have the buy money?
Yeah. And... I got the yeyo, too.
Wh-what? You got the yeyo?
Yeah, I got it. Right.
Bring it here to my place in one hour. Come alone.
Fuck you! I'm taking the stuff to your boss, Lopez, myself. Not you. Me!
Eh, Frank got held up at the golf course. So he told me to come pick you up. He said he'd meet us at the track later.
He said to bet on Ice Cream in the first, by the way.
In that thing? You must be kidding.
What you talking about? That's a Cadillac.
I wouldn't be caught dead in that thing.
Oh, come on. I mean, it's got a few years. But it's a cream puff.
It looks like somebody's nightmare.
Look, it doesn't really matter, right?
I'm just trying to be friendly, girl.
God, I've got enough friends. I don't need another. Especially one who just got off a banana boat.
Banana boat? Hold it, man. You're thinking of the wrong guy. I didn't come off no banana boat. You're thinking of someone else, maybe.
Somebody oughta do something about those... those whores."
Martin Burney,T,Crazy Jealous Guy,"You sneaked off inexplicably, need I remind you how I worried?
No. You reminded me enough the night I came back.
You're not suggesting I enjoyed that?
God, no. That would make you a monster.
I can't live without you. And I won't let you live without me.
We all forget things. That's what reminding is for.
Does it give you that much pleasure to humiliate me?
There's the telephone. You could call the police. I know your every thought, Laura. You're wondering if they can protect you. Who knows? They may issue an order instructing me to stay away from my own wife. Nothing can keep me away. I love you, Laura. I can't live without you. And I won't let you live without me."
Sam 'Ace' Rothstein,"Q, T","Consummate Professional, Crazy Jealous Guy","No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on. You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat. You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun. And if you beat him with a gun, you better kill him, because he'll keep comin' back and back until one of you is dead.
Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here: the right way, the wrong way, and the way that *I* do it. You understand?
In Vegas, everybody's gotta watch everybody else. Since the players are looking to beat the casino, the dealers are watching the players. The box men are watching the dealers. The floor men are watching the box men. The pit bosses are watching the floor men. The shift bosses are watching the pit bosses. The casino manager is watching the shift bosses. I'm watching the casino manager. And the eye-in-the-sky is watching us all.
When you love someone, you've gotta trust them. There's no other way. You've got to give them the key to everything that's yours. Otherwise, what's the point? And for a while, I believed, that's the kind of love I had.
The town will never be the same. After the Tangiers, the big corporations took it all over. Today it looks like Disneyland. And while the kids play cardboard pirates, Mommy and Daddy drop the house payments and Junior's college money on the poker slots. In the old days, dealers knew your name, what you drank, what you played. Today, it's like checkin' into an airport. And if you order room service, you're lucky if you get it by Thursday. Today, it's all gone. You get a whale show up with four million in a suitcase, and some twenty-five-year-old hotel school kid is gonna want his Social Security Number. After the Teamsters got knocked out of the box, the corporations tore down practically every one of the old casinos. And where did the money come from to rebuild the pyramids? Junk bonds. But in the end, I wound up right back where I started. I could still pick winners, and I could still make money for all kinds of people back home. And why mess up a good thing? And that's that.
it wasn't long before what I was afraid what was going to happen: happened, Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas, from then on I couldn't be seen talking to him anywhere in Vegas or anywhere near it.
so in other words: I'm fucked.
In so many words, yes.
It just didn't sink into his head what the Black Book is and what it meant, not being banned from every casino is just one thing but being this book gets you into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state, I mean you're listed in there with Al Capone, but Nicky didn't care.
Hello Mrs. Rothstein, how are you?
You're one of the most gorgeous women I've ever seen. You're a lucky man, Mr. Rothstein.
Thank you, thanks for that compliment.
He was a young kid from the casino. Nice kid, bright boy. What balls on this fuckin' kid. The next day I fired him.
I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands?
No.
Can't do it with both hands?
No, sir.
Can you do it with your left hand?
Well, I... I never tried.
So you're a righty?
Yeah.
Now you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.
Where the fuck do you get off talking to people about me behind my back, going over my head?
What people?
What people, d'ja think I wasn't gonna find out?
I don't even know what you're talking about Nick...
No? You said I'm bringing heat on YOU? I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin shit? You're orderin me out? You better get your own fuckin army pal!
I didn't do anything, I mean, I didn't order you or anybody. I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you and that was a problem.
You want me to get out of my own fuckin town?
Yeah I said l-let the bullshit blow over for a while, so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino it's my ass, it's not yours, it's my ass!
Oh I don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin casino because I made that possible. I'm what counts out here, not your fuckin country clubs or your fuckin TV shows! And what the fuck are you doing on TV anyhow? You know I get calls from back home every fuckin day, they think you went bat shit!
I'm only on TV because I got to be able to hang around the casino. You understand that, you know that, come on.
Your fuckin ass! You coulda had the food and beverage job without going on television. You wanted to go on TV.
Yeah I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum, I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown, that's right, yeah!
You're making a big fuckin spectacle of yourself!
Me? I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin heat on me, I mean every time I meet somebody the big question is ""do I know you?""
Oh sure now you wanna bring your fuckin license on me, is that it?
No, Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean you asked me and I know you were gonna come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told you? Do you remember what I told you?
Back- Back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. One minute. I asked you? When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here? Get this through your head, you...
You never...
Get this through your head you Jew motherfucker, you. You only exist out here because of me. That's the only reason. Without me, you, personally, every fuckin' wise guy skell around'll take a piece of your fuckin' Jew ass. Then where you gonna go? You're fuckin' warned. Don't ever go over my fuckin' head again. You motherfucker, you.
From now on, I want you to put an equal amount of blueberries in each muffin.
...An equal amount of blueberries in each muffin.
Do you know how long that's going to take?
I don't care how long it takes. Put an equal amount in each muffin.
In the casino, the cardinal rule is to keep them playing and to keep them coming back. The longer they play, the more they lose, and in the end, we get it all.
Back home, they would have put me in jail for what I'm doing. Here, they're giving me awards.
Now you need approval from him to go home?
So what? So who fucking blew you in the parking lot before you came in, huh?
You make me sick, you fuck. Once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.
Oh, fuck you! Fuck you, Sam Rothstein! *Fuck you*!
Nicky's methods of betting weren't scientific, but they worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. I mean, what were they going to do, muscle Nicky? Nicky was the muscle.
Think he got the point?
What are you doing? He's a square guy, for christ's sakes. You can't treat him like that. He's gonna run to the FBI.
Fuck the FBI! That prick's been dodging me for three weeks. And what is it with you? All of a sudden, you're trying to tell me what to do all the time.
I'm not trying to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doing? Where's your head?
Where's my head? Where's your fucking balls? Huh? You know I'm trying to put something really big together out here. You know what I'm talking about, huh? You know! If you're acting like this now, how can I depend on you? There's a lot of things going to change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're going to have to go my fucking way.
Listen, Nick, you got to understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year going through the place. It's all over, I'm going to tell you, it's all over, if I don't get that license. And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand?
Yeah, forget about your fucking license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fucking license.
You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't want to go along with me, is that it? You should say so.
No, I don't want to come along with you. I'll be honest with you.
Just say so- All right, fine.
I don't want to be involved in anything you're talking about, okay? I just want to run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it.
You mean, quiet like this?
""I'm the boss."" That's quiet?
That's all taken out of context. I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened.
Well, back home they don't know about fucking control. That looks bad.
Looks bad? I'm going to tell you what looks bad. Every time you're on television, I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad!
What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
What happened to me? What happened to you? You lost your control.
I lost control? Look at you! You're fucking walking around like John Barrymore! A fucking pink robe and a fucking cigarette holder? I lost control? You know, I didn't want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. Even your own wife.
My wife?
Yeah.
Now, what does she have to do with all this?
Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident.
All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fucking point. The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fucking problem.
Listen, I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
I can't do that.
The bombing was never authorized, but I suspect I know who lit the fuse. And so did the powers that be.
Whoever it was, they put the dynamite under the passenger's side. But what they didn't know, what nobody outside the factory knew, was that that model car was made with a metal plate under the driver's seat. It's the only thing that saved my life.
I tried to do everything I could for you, even though I knew, deep down inside, you would bury me.
I bury you? You buried yourself.
Ace don't... listen, don't... don't make a scene, all right?
I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.
She didn't know who to turn to. She... she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin' to save your marriage.
Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.
Hey, be fuckin' nice. Calm. Be nice. Don't fuck up in here,
Four reels, sevens across on three $15,000 jackpots. Do you have any idea what the odds are?
Shoot, it's gotta be in the millions, maybe more.
Three fuckin' jackpots in 20 minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?
Well, it happened so quick, 3 guys won; I didn't have a chance...
You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was going on?
Well, there's no way to determine that...
Yes there is! An infallible way, they won!
Well, it's a casino! People gotta win sometimes.
Ward, you're pissing me off. Now you're insulting my intelligence; what you think I am, a fuckin' idiot? You know goddamn well that someone had to get into those machines and set those fuckin' reels. The probability of one four-reel machine is a million and a half to one; the probability of three machines in a row; it's in the billions! It cannot happen, would not happen, you fuckin' momo! What's the matter with you? Didn't you see you were being set up on the second win?
I really think...
Wait! You didn't see that you were being set up on the second win?
I really think you're overreacting...
Listen, you fuckin' yokel, I've had it with you. I've been carrying your ass in this place ever since I got here. Get your ass and get your things and get out of here.
You're firing me?
I'm firing you. No, I'm not firing, I'm firing you, ya...
You might regret this, Mr. Rothstein.
I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.
This is not the way to treat people.
Listen, if you didn't know you were being scammed you're too fuckin' dumb to keep this job, if you did know, you were in on it. Either way, YOU'RE OUT! Get out. Go on, let's go.
You come down here right now! Get down here and talk to me, goddamn it! Don't fucking ignore me, you motherfucker! I mean it! You come down here right now! Get down here and talk to me, goddamn it! Fuck you! Goddamn you, come out here! I'm gonna drive your fucking car through the living room! You fucking coward! You motherfucker, you! Come out here and talk to me, you fucker!
Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're on drugs.
I am not!
You're gonna be sorry if you don't stop it! The whole neighborhood...
Don't you threaten me! Don't you threaten me! You are not threatening me anymore! You fuck! You fuck! I'm sick of you! I AM fucking Nicky Santoro! I am! He's my new sponsor! How about that, you fuckhead?
What are you looking at? Fuck off!
You fucking mo-mo, what's the matter with you?
The Feds were watching Nicky play golf for so long that they ran out of gas. Just what I needed, right in front of the control board.
A hundred dollars to whoever hits the plane.
This is the end result of all the bright lights, and the comp trips, and all the champagne, and free hotel suites, and all the broads and all the booze. It's all been arranged just for us to get *your money*.
Are you out of your fucking mind? You tie up our kid and lock the fucking door? Are you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fucking mind?
It was just for a little while, Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there.
I ought to fucking have you committed. You fucking do that again, I'll...
I was just gonna be out for a little while. She was asleep. I was gonna be right back before she even woke up.
Listen. Listen, you fucking cunt. Listen to me.
Fuck you. I was gonna be back before she woke up.
Listen to me. Listen carefully. You ever touch her again, you ever do anything like that again, I'll fucking kill ya, pure and simple. You hear me? Pure and fuckin' simple.
Why don't you just let me go, Sam?
I'll fucking kill you. You fucking whore.
I'll sign anything you want me to sign. I just want the key to my jewelry, and I want you to let me go.
You want your jewelry?
I want you to let me go.
And let you disgrace me, you fucking pig? Let you disgrace me? Get up and be a mother. Get in the car and go to the house right now. Get up and get in the... get... get up. Get up!
I wouldn't do that if I were you. I wouldn't do that...
Get the fuck... are you threatening me? I'll fucking kill you in this place. Get up and go home.
I'm going! I'm going!
Sure enough, an hour later, I get the call.
Ace, what happened over there? I mean, did you know that guy you threw out was with me?
No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did? He insulted Billy. And then I walked over to him politely and he tells me to go fuck myself. Then he called me a faggot.
What?
So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.
What? Hold on a second.
Hey, come here.

You called my friend a faggot? You tell him to go fuck himself?
Nicky, I didn't
Is that what you did?
I did. I didn't
Tell him to go fuck himself? You fucking hick! Fucking.
you big fucking hick, you. Come here. Come here.
Get him up. Come here.

You go over there right now and you apologize. You better hope he lets you back in. If you ever get out of line over there again, I'll smash your fucking head so hard you won't be able to get that cowboy hat on. You hear me? Fucking hick.
Ace, listen to me. this guy obviously doesn't know who he was talking to, you understand? He doesn't know that, uh, we're dear friends. I mean, he's already very sorry. But, uh, if you could do me a favor to let him back in, I swear to you he'll never get out of line again. I promise you that.
If he does it again, he's out for good. I don't care what it is, Nick, I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let him in the place again.
I'm sorry about this. Really. All right, Ace?
Okay.
Thanks, pal.
You took your boots off? You put your feet on the table... you shit-kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smelling motherfucker you! You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the fucking desert! You understand?
Go over there and apologize.
Go! Get the fuck over there!
You guys have to be kidding, adjourned? What do you mean adjourned? Mr. Chairman, Senator. You promised me a hearing, you won't allow me a hearing? You didn't even look at the FBI reports. When you were my guest, Mr. Chairman, Senator, at the Tangiers hotel, did you not promise me that I would have a fair hearing?
I was never... I was never your guest at the Tangiers...
You were never my guest?
...that's right.
I never comped you? I don't comp you at least 2 or 3 times a month? At the Tangiers?
I... I'd like to answer that at this time, Mr. Rothstein is being very typical to this point. He's lying. The only time I was at the Tangiers was when I had dinner with Barney Greenstein.
Was I at that dinner? Tell me, was I at that dinner?
You were wandering.
Was I at that dinner? Was I?
You were wandering around. You were in the... you were in the building.
I was in the building? You know damn well I was at that dinner, and you swore to me I would have a fair hearing. Did you not? Did you not? Well, tell me I was at least at the dinner. Allow me that much. Give me that much at least!
Yes, you were.
Yeah. Thanks for not calling me a liar. You son of a bitch.
And this... this is how she backed him off.
Are we certain that you want the gamin' control board eyeballing your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?
I think you're way out of line talking to me like that. What your saying is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise.
Normally, my prospects of coming back alive from a meeting with Nicky were 99 out of 100. But this time, when I heard him say ""a couple of hundred yards down the road"", I gave myself 50-50.
They had enough of Nicky. They had enough. I mean, how much more were they gonna take? So, they made an example of him and his brother: they buried them while they were still breathing.
The guy is history as far as I'm concerned. History.
You can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner.
So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it.
For Nicky, Las Vegas was the fucking wild west.
Listen, I gotta meet Clean Face right away, what about the Chez Paris?
I gotta meet Charlie the Banker right away at your house, OK?
No, you can't, you gotta make a reservation, it's all booked up.
No no, it's ok.
It's impossible, it's booked up, you gotta make a reservation, it's very difficult to get in.
I don't want a meeting at my house.
It's ok, I'll use the service entrance. I'll see you at nine.
I'll come in from the golf course side. See you at six.
Before I ever ran a casino or got myself blown up, Ace Rothstein was a helluva handicapper, I can tell you that. I was so good that when I bet, I can change the odds for every bookmaker in the country. I'm serious. I had it down so cold that I was given paradise on earth. I was given one of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas to run: The Tangiers, by the only kind of guys that can get you that kind of money. Sixty-two million seven hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details.
Matter of fact, nobody knew all the details. But it should have been perfect. I mean he had me, Nicky Santoro, his best friend watching his ass. And he had Ginger, the woman he loved on his arm. But in the end, we fucked it all up. It should have been so sweet, too. But it turned out to be the last time that street guys like us were ever given anything that fuckin' valuable again.
I don't give a shit who he's connected to. Tell him to take his fuckin' feet off the table. What's he think this is, a goddamn sawdust joint?
Sir, would you mind taking your feet off the table and putting your shoes back on?
Yeah, I would mind. I'm having a bad night.
Fuckin' asshole won't budge.
Call security.
How are you?
Good. How are you?
Fine. Good. You want to do me a favor? You want to take your feet off the table and put your shoes back on?
Fuck you!


I want you vacate this guy off the premises, and I want you to exit him off his feet and use his head to open the fucking door.
Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside?
Bullshit, I ain't going anywhere.
Bullshit, you're coming with us!
Fuck you! FUCK YOU! You know who you're fucking with? Huh? Do you? You fucking faggot! Do you know who you're fucking with?
Here we go!
I don't believe this!

A routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino executive, Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein accused the state's top gaming officials of corruption and hypocrisy.
What are you runnin' for, Bob? What are you running for? Don't you remember? You promised me a fair hearing when you were getting comped at my hotel, and you were asking me for copies of your bills so you could put 'em on your expense account!
In a wild outburst that followed his gaming license denial, Rothstein followed several stunned commissioners into the hallway where he continued his harangue until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.
Bullshit! Bullshit! We all have a past. You have a past. I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me!
Long suspected of running the Tangiers without a license, yesterday's hearing was to determine whether someone with Rothstein's history was qualified to officially hold a top gaming post.
Fuckin' hypocrites!
Okay, I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.
Who were you with?
I was with someone.
I know you were with someone, who were you with?
I just hope it's not someone who I think it might be. I just hope it's not them.
We had a deal, remember? He said if things didn't work out, I could take my stuff and my daughter and leave.
Look in my eyes. Look - look in my eyes. You know me. Do you see anything in these eyes that would let someone in your condition take my child away from me? You know that'll never happen.
Would you knock it off, Sam?
I'm just trying to figure it out.
Nothing to figure out. I'm home, we're working it out.
Yeah, but I've been told before we're working it out. To think that you're home...
after what you just put me through with Amy... is a favor to me?
So counting the watch, maybe four thousand for expenses over the weekends, of which you must have had a good time. I know he did. That's for sure. I know that fucking peice of shit had a good fucking time. On my money. You might as well have fucked him, which you probably did anyway. You looking me a certain way. You're teary-eyed. I get it. You're good actress, you know that? Good fucking actress. Can't fucking get that pity out of people. I'm no john. You understand? You always thought I was but I'm not. I'm no sucker. Fucking pimp cocksucker. He's lucky I didn't kill him last time. Lucky he's fucking living. And if you had stayed with him, and you would have run away, you would have been dead, both of you. Dead! Dead!
You know, I don't know if I could do this even if I wanted to. The Gaming Commission would never give me a license. I have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.
You don't have to have a license to work in a casino. All you gotta do is apply for one. The state law says you can work in a casino while they're processing your application. They got a ten-year backlog.
But what happens when they do find out?
Why would they want to find out? We're putting a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out? And besides, they'll never find out. All you got to do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens is they take your application and they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys working there for thirty years who don't have a license.
It's a tough proposition, Andy. You know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way.
You got it.
I'm serious. No interference.
Nobody's going to interfere with you running the casino. I guarantee it.
In the casino, the cardinal rule is to keep them playing and keep them coming back. The longer they play, the more they lose. In the end, we get it all.
Back home, they would have put me in jail for what I'm doing. But out here, they're givin' me awards.
And what happens next? I can't believe it. Who the hell would believe that the FBI had a wire in the place looking for some information about some old homicide about some guy who was whacked out God knows when over God knows what. Would you believe such a thing could happen? Every FBI man across the country had their ears open, this guy basically sunk the whole world.
Greedy bitch!
I don't give a shit who he's connected to. Tell him to take his fuckin' feet off the table. What's he think this is, a goddamn sawdust joint?
You tied up our little daughter to a bed? What the fuck is the matter with you? Is there something mentally wrong with you?
It was only for a couple hours Sam... the babysitter wasn't around, so I did what I could.
I want you to exit this guy off the premises, I want you to exit him off his feet and I want you to use his head to open the fucking door.
If you ever come back again, ever, to take her money, next time bring a pistol. That way you've got a chance.
Now here's this guy reading the dealer's whole card and signaling his buddy at this table.
And that's just what these hustlers look for. They cruise from casino to casino, looking for weak dealers the way lions look for weak antelope.
They never know what hit them. And if, and when, they do find out that they just got zapped by a cattle prod, they wish they really did have a heart attack.
From now on, I want you to put an equal amount of blueberries in each muffin.
An equal amount of blueberries in each muffin.
Do you know how long that's going to take?
I don't care how long it takes, put an equal amount in each muffin.
But one thing I could just never understand was how she could have everything under control but her old pimp Lester Diamond.
Look, Gin, you know I got other people in this. I got partners. But I want you to understand that I am lookin' out for you in this thing. Okay? You're going to get yours back... and you're gonna get it back first. Okay?
All right.
Okay?
Yeah.
Where are you goin'? Where are you? You're in that place. Where are you?
I'm here.
No, you're not. Where are you? Where are you?
I'm always here for you.
You are.
I am.
. Be careful.
The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep.
And that's that.
Look what they did to my hand man!
All right, I'm gonna give you a choice. You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here. You can't have both. What do you want?
I just wanna get outta here.
And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck up around here. You understand?
I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.
You're fuckin' right you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here, if we catch either one of ya, we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw? We're gonna use it. We don't fuck around in this place. You got it? Get outta here.
Thank you.
Throw him out into the alley and just tell the cops he got hit by a car.
I have a large family.
How many kids do you have?
I'm very proud to say that we have eight children.
That's amazing.
No, no, please. Please. There's nothing to it, heh. It was my pleasure.
No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on. You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat. You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun. And if you beat him with a gun, you better kill him, because he'll keep comin' back and back until one of you is dead.
Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here: the right way, the wrong way, and the way that *I* do it. You understand?
In Vegas, everybody's gotta watch everybody else. Since the players are looking to beat the casino, the dealers are watching the players. The box men are watching the dealers. The floor men are watching the box men. The pit bosses are watching the floor men. The shift bosses are watching the pit bosses. The casino manager is watching the shift bosses. I'm watching the casino manager. And the eye-in-the-sky is watching us all.
When you love someone, you've gotta trust them. There's no other way. You've got to give them the key to everything that's yours. Otherwise, what's the point? And for a while, I believed, that's the kind of love I had.
The town will never be the same. After the Tangiers, the big corporations took it all over. Today it looks like Disneyland. And while the kids play cardboard pirates, Mommy and Daddy drop the house payments and Junior's college money on the poker slots. In the old days, dealers knew your name, what you drank, what you played. Today, it's like checkin' into an airport. And if you order room service, you're lucky if you get it by Thursday. Today, it's all gone. You get a whale show up with four million in a suitcase, and some twenty-five-year-old hotel school kid is gonna want his Social Security Number. After the Teamsters got knocked out of the box, the corporations tore down practically every one of the old casinos. And where did the money come from to rebuild the pyramids? Junk bonds. But in the end, I wound up right back where I started. I could still pick winners, and I could still make money for all kinds of people back home. And why mess up a good thing? And that's that.
it wasn't long before what I was afraid what was going to happen: happened, Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas, from then on I couldn't be seen talking to him anywhere in Vegas or anywhere near it.
so in other words: I'm fucked.
In so many words, yes.
It just didn't sink into his head what the Black Book is and what it meant, not being banned from every casino is just one thing but being this book gets you into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state, I mean you're listed in there with Al Capone, but Nicky didn't care.
Hello Mrs. Rothstein, how are you?
You're one of the most gorgeous women I've ever seen. You're a lucky man, Mr. Rothstein.
Thank you, thanks for that compliment.
He was a young kid from the casino. Nice kid, bright boy. What balls on this fuckin' kid. The next day I fired him.
I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands?
No.
Can't do it with both hands?
No, sir.
Can you do it with your left hand?
Well, I... I never tried.
So you're a righty?
Yeah.
Now you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.
Where the fuck do you get off talking to people about me behind my back, going over my head?
What people?
What people, d'ja think I wasn't gonna find out?
I don't even know what you're talking about Nick...
No? You said I'm bringing heat on YOU? I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin shit? You're orderin me out? You better get your own fuckin army pal!
I didn't do anything, I mean, I didn't order you or anybody. I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you and that was a problem.
You want me to get out of my own fuckin town?
Yeah I said l-let the bullshit blow over for a while, so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino it's my ass, it's not yours, it's my ass!
Oh I don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin casino because I made that possible. I'm what counts out here, not your fuckin country clubs or your fuckin TV shows! And what the fuck are you doing on TV anyhow? You know I get calls from back home every fuckin day, they think you went bat shit!
I'm only on TV because I got to be able to hang around the casino. You understand that, you know that, come on.
Your fuckin ass! You coulda had the food and beverage job without going on television. You wanted to go on TV.
Yeah I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum, I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown, that's right, yeah!
You're making a big fuckin spectacle of yourself!
Me? I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin heat on me, I mean every time I meet somebody the big question is ""do I know you?""
Oh sure now you wanna bring your fuckin license on me, is that it?
No, Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean you asked me and I know you were gonna come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told you? Do you remember what I told you?
Back- Back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. One minute. I asked you? When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here? Get this through your head, you...
You never...
Get this through your head you Jew motherfucker, you. You only exist out here because of me. That's the only reason. Without me, you, personally, every fuckin' wise guy skell around'll take a piece of your fuckin' Jew ass. Then where you gonna go? You're fuckin' warned. Don't ever go over my fuckin' head again. You motherfucker, you.
From now on, I want you to put an equal amount of blueberries in each muffin.
...An equal amount of blueberries in each muffin.
Do you know how long that's going to take?
I don't care how long it takes. Put an equal amount in each muffin.
In the casino, the cardinal rule is to keep them playing and to keep them coming back. The longer they play, the more they lose, and in the end, we get it all.
Back home, they would have put me in jail for what I'm doing. Here, they're giving me awards.
Now you need approval from him to go home?
So what? So who fucking blew you in the parking lot before you came in, huh?
You make me sick, you fuck. Once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.
Oh, fuck you! Fuck you, Sam Rothstein! *Fuck you*!
Nicky's methods of betting weren't scientific, but they worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. I mean, what were they going to do, muscle Nicky? Nicky was the muscle.
Think he got the point?
What are you doing? He's a square guy, for christ's sakes. You can't treat him like that. He's gonna run to the FBI.
Fuck the FBI! That prick's been dodging me for three weeks. And what is it with you? All of a sudden, you're trying to tell me what to do all the time.
I'm not trying to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doing? Where's your head?
Where's my head? Where's your fucking balls? Huh? You know I'm trying to put something really big together out here. You know what I'm talking about, huh? You know! If you're acting like this now, how can I depend on you? There's a lot of things going to change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're going to have to go my fucking way.
Listen, Nick, you got to understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year going through the place. It's all over, I'm going to tell you, it's all over, if I don't get that license. And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand?
Yeah, forget about your fucking license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fucking license.
You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't want to go along with me, is that it? You should say so.
No, I don't want to come along with you. I'll be honest with you.
Just say so- All right, fine.
I don't want to be involved in anything you're talking about, okay? I just want to run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it.
You mean, quiet like this?
""I'm the boss."" That's quiet?
That's all taken out of context. I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened.
Well, back home they don't know about fucking control. That looks bad.
Looks bad? I'm going to tell you what looks bad. Every time you're on television, I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad!
What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
What happened to me? What happened to you? You lost your control.
I lost control? Look at you! You're fucking walking around like John Barrymore! A fucking pink robe and a fucking cigarette holder? I lost control? You know, I didn't want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. Even your own wife.
My wife?
Yeah.
Now, what does she have to do with all this?
Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident.
All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fucking point. The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fucking problem.
Listen, I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
I can't do that.
The bombing was never authorized, but I suspect I know who lit the fuse. And so did the powers that be.
Whoever it was, they put the dynamite under the passenger's side. But what they didn't know, what nobody outside the factory knew, was that that model car was made with a metal plate under the driver's seat. It's the only thing that saved my life.
I tried to do everything I could for you, even though I knew, deep down inside, you would bury me.
I bury you? You buried yourself.
Ace don't... listen, don't... don't make a scene, all right?
I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.
She didn't know who to turn to. She... she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin' to save your marriage.
Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.
Hey, be fuckin' nice. Calm. Be nice. Don't fuck up in here,
Four reels, sevens across on three $15,000 jackpots. Do you have any idea what the odds are?
Shoot, it's gotta be in the millions, maybe more.
Three fuckin' jackpots in 20 minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?
Well, it happened so quick, 3 guys won; I didn't have a chance...
You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was going on?
Well, there's no way to determine that...
Yes there is! An infallible way, they won!
Well, it's a casino! People gotta win sometimes.
Ward, you're pissing me off. Now you're insulting my intelligence; what you think I am, a fuckin' idiot? You know goddamn well that someone had to get into those machines and set those fuckin' reels. The probability of one four-reel machine is a million and a half to one; the probability of three machines in a row; it's in the billions! It cannot happen, would not happen, you fuckin' momo! What's the matter with you? Didn't you see you were being set up on the second win?
I really think...
Wait! You didn't see that you were being set up on the second win?
I really think you're overreacting...
Listen, you fuckin' yokel, I've had it with you. I've been carrying your ass in this place ever since I got here. Get your ass and get your things and get out of here.
You're firing me?
I'm firing you. No, I'm not firing, I'm firing you, ya...
You might regret this, Mr. Rothstein.
I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.
This is not the way to treat people.
Listen, if you didn't know you were being scammed you're too fuckin' dumb to keep this job, if you did know, you were in on it. Either way, YOU'RE OUT! Get out. Go on, let's go.
You come down here right now! Get down here and talk to me, goddamn it! Don't fucking ignore me, you motherfucker! I mean it! You come down here right now! Get down here and talk to me, goddamn it! Fuck you! Goddamn you, come out here! I'm gonna drive your fucking car through the living room! You fucking coward! You motherfucker, you! Come out here and talk to me, you fucker!
Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're on drugs.
I am not!
You're gonna be sorry if you don't stop it! The whole neighborhood...
Don't you threaten me! Don't you threaten me! You are not threatening me anymore! You fuck! You fuck! I'm sick of you! I AM fucking Nicky Santoro! I am! He's my new sponsor! How about that, you fuckhead?
What are you looking at? Fuck off!
You fucking mo-mo, what's the matter with you?
The Feds were watching Nicky play golf for so long that they ran out of gas. Just what I needed, right in front of the control board.
A hundred dollars to whoever hits the plane.
This is the end result of all the bright lights, and the comp trips, and all the champagne, and free hotel suites, and all the broads and all the booze. It's all been arranged just for us to get *your money*.
Are you out of your fucking mind? You tie up our kid and lock the fucking door? Are you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fucking mind?
It was just for a little while, Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there.
I ought to fucking have you committed. You fucking do that again, I'll...
I was just gonna be out for a little while. She was asleep. I was gonna be right back before she even woke up.
Listen. Listen, you fucking cunt. Listen to me.
Fuck you. I was gonna be back before she woke up.
Listen to me. Listen carefully. You ever touch her again, you ever do anything like that again, I'll fucking kill ya, pure and simple. You hear me? Pure and fuckin' simple.
Why don't you just let me go, Sam?
I'll fucking kill you. You fucking whore.
I'll sign anything you want me to sign. I just want the key to my jewelry, and I want you to let me go.
You want your jewelry?
I want you to let me go.
And let you disgrace me, you fucking pig? Let you disgrace me? Get up and be a mother. Get in the car and go to the house right now. Get up and get in the... get... get up. Get up!
I wouldn't do that if I were you. I wouldn't do that...
Get the fuck... are you threatening me? I'll fucking kill you in this place. Get up and go home.
I'm going! I'm going!
Sure enough, an hour later, I get the call.
Ace, what happened over there? I mean, did you know that guy you threw out was with me?
No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did? He insulted Billy. And then I walked over to him politely and he tells me to go fuck myself. Then he called me a faggot.
What?
So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.
What? Hold on a second.
Hey, come here.

You called my friend a faggot? You tell him to go fuck himself?
Nicky, I didn't
Is that what you did?
I did. I didn't
Tell him to go fuck himself? You fucking hick! Fucking.
you big fucking hick, you. Come here. Come here.
Get him up. Come here.

You go over there right now and you apologize. You better hope he lets you back in. If you ever get out of line over there again, I'll smash your fucking head so hard you won't be able to get that cowboy hat on. You hear me? Fucking hick.
Ace, listen to me. this guy obviously doesn't know who he was talking to, you understand? He doesn't know that, uh, we're dear friends. I mean, he's already very sorry. But, uh, if you could do me a favor to let him back in, I swear to you he'll never get out of line again. I promise you that.
If he does it again, he's out for good. I don't care what it is, Nick, I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let him in the place again.
I'm sorry about this. Really. All right, Ace?
Okay.
Thanks, pal.
You took your boots off? You put your feet on the table... you shit-kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smelling motherfucker you! You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the fucking desert! You understand?
Go over there and apologize.
Go! Get the fuck over there!
You guys have to be kidding, adjourned? What do you mean adjourned? Mr. Chairman, Senator. You promised me a hearing, you won't allow me a hearing? You didn't even look at the FBI reports. When you were my guest, Mr. Chairman, Senator, at the Tangiers hotel, did you not promise me that I would have a fair hearing?
I was never... I was never your guest at the Tangiers...
You were never my guest?
...that's right.
I never comped you? I don't comp you at least 2 or 3 times a month? At the Tangiers?
I... I'd like to answer that at this time, Mr. Rothstein is being very typical to this point. He's lying. The only time I was at the Tangiers was when I had dinner with Barney Greenstein.
Was I at that dinner? Tell me, was I at that dinner?
You were wandering.
Was I at that dinner? Was I?
You were wandering around. You were in the... you were in the building.
I was in the building? You know damn well I was at that dinner, and you swore to me I would have a fair hearing. Did you not? Did you not? Well, tell me I was at least at the dinner. Allow me that much. Give me that much at least!
Yes, you were.
Yeah. Thanks for not calling me a liar. You son of a bitch.
And this... this is how she backed him off.
Are we certain that you want the gamin' control board eyeballing your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?
I think you're way out of line talking to me like that. What your saying is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise.
Normally, my prospects of coming back alive from a meeting with Nicky were 99 out of 100. But this time, when I heard him say ""a couple of hundred yards down the road"", I gave myself 50-50.
They had enough of Nicky. They had enough. I mean, how much more were they gonna take? So, they made an example of him and his brother: they buried them while they were still breathing.
The guy is history as far as I'm concerned. History.
You can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner.
So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it.
For Nicky, Las Vegas was the fucking wild west.
Listen, I gotta meet Clean Face right away, what about the Chez Paris?
I gotta meet Charlie the Banker right away at your house, OK?
No, you can't, you gotta make a reservation, it's all booked up.
No no, it's ok.
It's impossible, it's booked up, you gotta make a reservation, it's very difficult to get in.
I don't want a meeting at my house.
It's ok, I'll use the service entrance. I'll see you at nine.
I'll come in from the golf course side. See you at six.
Before I ever ran a casino or got myself blown up, Ace Rothstein was a helluva handicapper, I can tell you that. I was so good that when I bet, I can change the odds for every bookmaker in the country. I'm serious. I had it down so cold that I was given paradise on earth. I was given one of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas to run: The Tangiers, by the only kind of guys that can get you that kind of money. Sixty-two million seven hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details.
Matter of fact, nobody knew all the details. But it should have been perfect. I mean he had me, Nicky Santoro, his best friend watching his ass. And he had Ginger, the woman he loved on his arm. But in the end, we fucked it all up. It should have been so sweet, too. But it turned out to be the last time that street guys like us were ever given anything that fuckin' valuable again.
I don't give a shit who he's connected to. Tell him to take his fuckin' feet off the table. What's he think this is, a goddamn sawdust joint?
Sir, would you mind taking your feet off the table and putting your shoes back on?
Yeah, I would mind. I'm having a bad night.
Fuckin' asshole won't budge.
Call security.
How are you?
Good. How are you?
Fine. Good. You want to do me a favor? You want to take your feet off the table and put your shoes back on?
Fuck you!


I want you vacate this guy off the premises, and I want you to exit him off his feet and use his head to open the fucking door.
Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside?
Bullshit, I ain't going anywhere.
Bullshit, you're coming with us!
Fuck you! FUCK YOU! You know who you're fucking with? Huh? Do you? You fucking faggot! Do you know who you're fucking with?
Here we go!
I don't believe this!

A routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino executive, Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein accused the state's top gaming officials of corruption and hypocrisy.
What are you runnin' for, Bob? What are you running for? Don't you remember? You promised me a fair hearing when you were getting comped at my hotel, and you were asking me for copies of your bills so you could put 'em on your expense account!
In a wild outburst that followed his gaming license denial, Rothstein followed several stunned commissioners into the hallway where he continued his harangue until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.
Bullshit! Bullshit! We all have a past. You have a past. I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me!
Long suspected of running the Tangiers without a license, yesterday's hearing was to determine whether someone with Rothstein's history was qualified to officially hold a top gaming post.
Fuckin' hypocrites!
Okay, I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.
Who were you with?
I was with someone.
I know you were with someone, who were you with?
I just hope it's not someone who I think it might be. I just hope it's not them.
We had a deal, remember? He said if things didn't work out, I could take my stuff and my daughter and leave.
Look in my eyes. Look - look in my eyes. You know me. Do you see anything in these eyes that would let someone in your condition take my child away from me? You know that'll never happen.
Would you knock it off, Sam?
I'm just trying to figure it out.
Nothing to figure out. I'm home, we're working it out.
Yeah, but I've been told before we're working it out. To think that you're home...
after what you just put me through with Amy... is a favor to me?
So counting the watch, maybe four thousand for expenses over the weekends, of which you must have had a good time. I know he did. That's for sure. I know that fucking peice of shit had a good fucking time. On my money. You might as well have fucked him, which you probably did anyway. You looking me a certain way. You're teary-eyed. I get it. You're good actress, you know that? Good fucking actress. Can't fucking get that pity out of people. I'm no john. You understand? You always thought I was but I'm not. I'm no sucker. Fucking pimp cocksucker. He's lucky I didn't kill him last time. Lucky he's fucking living. And if you had stayed with him, and you would have run away, you would have been dead, both of you. Dead! Dead!
You know, I don't know if I could do this even if I wanted to. The Gaming Commission would never give me a license. I have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.
You don't have to have a license to work in a casino. All you gotta do is apply for one. The state law says you can work in a casino while they're processing your application. They got a ten-year backlog.
But what happens when they do find out?
Why would they want to find out? We're putting a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out? And besides, they'll never find out. All you got to do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens is they take your application and they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys working there for thirty years who don't have a license.
It's a tough proposition, Andy. You know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way.
You got it.
I'm serious. No interference.
Nobody's going to interfere with you running the casino. I guarantee it.
In the casino, the cardinal rule is to keep them playing and keep them coming back. The longer they play, the more they lose. In the end, we get it all.
Back home, they would have put me in jail for what I'm doing. But out here, they're givin' me awards.
And what happens next? I can't believe it. Who the hell would believe that the FBI had a wire in the place looking for some information about some old homicide about some guy who was whacked out God knows when over God knows what. Would you believe such a thing could happen? Every FBI man across the country had their ears open, this guy basically sunk the whole world.
Greedy bitch!
I don't give a shit who he's connected to. Tell him to take his fuckin' feet off the table. What's he think this is, a goddamn sawdust joint?
You tied up our little daughter to a bed? What the fuck is the matter with you? Is there something mentally wrong with you?
It was only for a couple hours Sam... the babysitter wasn't around, so I did what I could.
I want you to exit this guy off the premises, I want you to exit him off his feet and I want you to use his head to open the fucking door.
If you ever come back again, ever, to take her money, next time bring a pistol. That way you've got a chance.
Now here's this guy reading the dealer's whole card and signaling his buddy at this table.
And that's just what these hustlers look for. They cruise from casino to casino, looking for weak dealers the way lions look for weak antelope.
They never know what hit them. And if, and when, they do find out that they just got zapped by a cattle prod, they wish they really did have a heart attack.
From now on, I want you to put an equal amount of blueberries in each muffin.
An equal amount of blueberries in each muffin.
Do you know how long that's going to take?
I don't care how long it takes, put an equal amount in each muffin.
But one thing I could just never understand was how she could have everything under control but her old pimp Lester Diamond.
Look, Gin, you know I got other people in this. I got partners. But I want you to understand that I am lookin' out for you in this thing. Okay? You're going to get yours back... and you're gonna get it back first. Okay?
All right.
Okay?
Yeah.
Where are you goin'? Where are you? You're in that place. Where are you?
I'm here.
No, you're not. Where are you? Where are you?
I'm always here for you.
You are.
I am.
. Be careful.
The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep.
And that's that.
Look what they did to my hand man!
All right, I'm gonna give you a choice. You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here. You can't have both. What do you want?
I just wanna get outta here.
And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck up around here. You understand?
I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.
You're fuckin' right you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here, if we catch either one of ya, we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw? We're gonna use it. We don't fuck around in this place. You got it? Get outta here.
Thank you.
Throw him out into the alley and just tell the cops he got hit by a car.
I have a large family.
How many kids do you have?
I'm very proud to say that we have eight children.
That's amazing.
No, no, please. Please. There's nothing to it, heh. It was my pleasure."
Tommy DeVito,T,Crazy Jealous Guy,"You're a pistol, you're really funny. You're really funny.
What do you mean I'm funny?
It's funny, you know. It's a good story, it's funny, you're a funny guy.

Get the fuck out of here, Tommy!
Ya motherfucker! I almost had him, I almost had him. Ya stuttering prick ya. Frankie, was he shaking? I wonder about you sometimes, Henry. You may fold under questioning.
No more shines, Billy.
What?
I said, no more shines. Maybe you didn't hear about it, you've been away a long time. They didn't go up there and tell you. I don't shine shoes anymore.
Relax, will ya? Ya flip right out, what's got into you? I'm breaking your balls a little bit, that's all. I'm only kidding with ya...
Sometimes you don't sound like you're kidding, you know, there's a lotta people around...
I'm only kidding with you, we're having a party, I just came home and I haven't seen you in a long time and I'm breaking your balls, and you're getting fucking fresh. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.
I'm sorry too. It's okay. No problem.
Okay, salud.
Now go home and get your fuckin' shinebox.
Mother fuckin' mutt! You, you fucking piece of shit!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on, come on, come on!
Motherfucking... He bought his fucking button! That fake old tough guy! You bought your fucking button! You mother fuck... Fuck! Keep that motherfucker here, keep him here!
What's the fuckin' matter with you? What - what is the fuckin' matter with you? What are you, stupid or what? Tommy, Tommy, I'm kidding with you. What the fuck are you doin'? What are you, a fuckin' sick maniac?
How am I meant to know you're kidding? What you mean, you're kidding? You breaking my fuckin' balls?
I'm fuckin' kidding with you! You fuckin' shoot the guy?
He's dead.
Good shot. What do you want from me? Good shot. Fuckin' rat anyway. His family's all rats. He'll grow up to be a rat.
You stupid bastard, I can't fuckin' believe you. Now, you're gonna dig the fuckin' thing now. You're gonna dig the hole. You're gonna do it. I got no fuckin' lime. You're gonna do it.
Who the fuck cares? I'll dig the fuckin' hole. I don't give a fuck. What is it, the first hole I dug? Not the first time I dug a hole. I'll fuckin' dig a hole. Where are the shovels?
What time is it?
It's eleven thirty, we're supposed to be there by nine.
Be ready in a minute.
Yeah, you were always fuckin' late, you were late for your own fuckin' funeral.
The only thing, is she won't go out with me alone, you know?
No.
No, what?
No.
No, what, Henry? Who the fuck asked you anything? I didn't even ask you anything, at least hear what I have to say.
Alright, what?
Okay, what? She don't want to go out with Italians alone. She's prejudiced against Italians. Do you believe that? In this day and age? What the fuck is the world coming to? I can't believe this, prejudiced against Ital - a Jew broad - prejudiced against Italians. Anyway, she won't go out with me alone unless her girlfriend comes with her, so I figured you could come along and go out with her girlfriend.
See? I knew it - I knew it. I knew it. I knew it.
You knew what, Henry? See? What? What the fuck is wrong with that?
When is this?
Tomorrow night.
I can't tomorrow night, I gotta meet Tuddy.
You could meet Tuddy. You could fucking come early and then still go.
Tommy, Tommy. Why do you always do this to me?
Don't give me that fucking ""Tommy"" shit. What the fuck I asked you for, Henry? I asked you for a favor. I do a lot of fucking favors for you, don't I? I'm trying to bang this fucking broad, you wanna help me out!
It's like... uh... ah...
What?
I don't understand you! She's fucking beautiful. Her fucking family, they live in the Five Towns there. You know these Jew broads got a lot of money. Maybe the family owns the whole fucking block. and you happen to end up with a big fucking score, motherfucker.
Oh fuck!
What?
See? With your fucking mouth!
Oklahoma Kid. That's me. I'm the Oklahoma Kid. You fuckin' varmint! Dance. Dance. YAHOO, YA MOTHERFUCKER!
We hit the deer and his paw... What do you call it? The paw.
The hoof.
It got caught in the grill. I got to hack it off.
Sure, mom, I settle down with a nice girl every night, then I'm free the next morning.
Just don't go busting my balls, Billy, okay?
Hey, Tommy, if I was gonna break your balls, I'd tell you to go home and get your shine box.
Now this kid, this kid was great. They, they used to call him Spitshine Tommy.
All right, so he got shot in the foot, what is it, a big fuckin' deal?
What the fuck are you doing? You're hanging around my fuckin' neck like a vulture, like impending danger.
Hey, Spider, that fuckin' bandage on your foot is bigger than your fuckin' head.
He said, ""No, you're gonna tell me something today, tough guy."" I said, ""All right, I'll tell you something: go fuck your mother.""
You know Spider, you're a fuckin' mumbling stuttering little fuck. You know that?
Hey, what's that movie that Bogart made?
Which one?
The one where he played a cowboy. He only did one.
Oh... ah... The Oklahoma Kid.
Shane?
Oklahoma Kid!
Shane...
What the fuck you looking at? Come on. Make that coffee to go. Let's go.
What the fuck are you doing? It's a joke! A joke! Put the fucking pot down!
Hey, Henry, Henry, hurry up, will ya? My mother's gonna make some fried peppers and sausage for us.
Oh, hey, Henry, Henry! Here's an arm!
Very funny, guys.
Here's a leg!
Here's a wing!
Hey, what do you like, the leg or the wing, Henry? Or ya still go for the old hearts and lungs?
Oh, that's so bad!
Hey Frank, let's chop him up.
All right.
Where you going? Where you going, you dizzy motherfucker, you?
To chop him up.
At Charlie's, not here!
Come on, what are you doing? Let's get the fuck outta here. I oughta let him
fucking drive. What are you waiting for?
The car's cold.
Get the fuck outta here! What fucking warm enough? Get outta here!
What am I, a mirage?
I didn't want to get blood on your floor.
""What do you want to tell me now, tough guy?"" I said, ""Bing, what are you doing here? I thought I told you to go fuck your mother!""
I thought he was gonna shit!
I could never hit that number.
Frankie, Frankie, Frankie. What the fuck does 528 have to do with 460? I can't believe this guy. Fuckin' 528 ain't even close to 460. Now what the fuck does that got to do with anything?
Eh, I been playin' that numba for three years.
What, do you got me on a fuckin' pay-no-mind list, kid?
Where's the strong box, you fuckin' varmint, you?
Oh, it was terrific, yeah. Nunzio, up in... agh!
Thought he'd never shut the fuck up.
Ah, pain in the ass."
John Lotter,T,Crazy Jealous Guy,"Leave him alone!
HIM? HIM?
Shut up, you fucking pervert. Are you a girl or are you not? ARE YOU A GIRL OR ARE YOU NOT?
There's an easy way to fix this problem.
Fuck you! You stay the fuck away from me!
Oh, you wanna fight?"
Jake McKenna,T,Crazy Jealous Guy,"Oh, fuck it away, fuck it away! But it ain't ever gonna go away!
You're a man without scruples. Oh, I can smell it on you.
Yeah, that's the sweat of a man that hasn't an honest bone in his body.
I got a mind to put you over my knee right now and paddle your ass raw!
Grace!
Jake! I thought you were in Phoenix.
Who the hell is this?
Who the hell are you?
I'm her husband!
Husband?
You're a slimy bastard who'd have his wife killed to get his hands on some money.
What does that make you?
The slimy bastard that's gonna' do it.
A man with no ethics is a free man. I don't envy you that.
You've been a bad girl, Grace!
What brings you to Superior, Bobby?
Car overheated.
Darrell taking good care of you, is he?
Darrell's dumb as a sack of hammers."
Duke of Monroth,T,Crazy Jealous Guy,"I don't like this ending...
Don't like the ending, my dear Duke?
Why should the courtesan chose the penniless sitar player over the maharajah who is offering her a lifetime of security? That's real love. Once the sitar player has satisfied his lust he will leave her with nothing. I suggest that the courtesan chose the maharajah.
But, but tell me, that ending does not uphold the Bohemian ideals of truth, beauty, freedom, and...
I don't care about your ridiculous dogma! Why shouldn't the courtesan chose the maharajah?
Because she doesn't love you!... Him... Hi-him, she doesn't love... she doesn't love him.
Oh, I see... Monsieur Zidler, the play will be rewritten with the courtesan choosing the maharajah and without the lovers' secret song. It will be rehearsed in the morning, ready for the opening tomorrow night...
But, my dear Duke, that will be quite impossible.
Harold, the Duke is being treated appallingly. These silly writers let their imaginations run away with themselves. Why don't you and I have a little supper, and then we can tell Monsieur Zidler how we would like the story to end.
You expect me to believe that scantily clad, in the arms of another man, in the middle of the night, inside an elephant you were rehearsing?
So exciting, we'll make them laugh, we'll make them cry. So delighting...
And in the end, should someone die?
She said you make her feel ""like a virgin.""
Virgin?
You know, touched for the very first time.
Why shouldn't the courtesan go for the maharajah?
Because she doesn't love you. Him... hi... him... sh... she doesn't love... him...
Mademaiselle Satine, I haven't quite finished writing that new scene. The ""Will The Lovers Be Meeting at the Sitar Player's Humble Abode"" scene. And I wondered if I could work on it with you later tonight.
But, my dear, I've arranged a magnificent supper for us in the Gothic Tower.
It's not important. We could work on it tomorrow.
Oh, how dare you! It cannot wait until tomorrow. The ""Lovers Will Be Meeting in the Sitar Player's Humble Abode"" scene is the most important in the production. We will work on it tonight until I am completely satisfied.
B-But my dear...
Dear Duke. Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
It's not that I'm not a jealous man. I just don't like other people touching my things.
...a little frog
Generally I like it.
The courtesan and sitar man are pulled apart by an evil plan...
but in the end she hears his song...
and their love is just too strong.
It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside.
She is mine.
She is mine."
Bobby Tennison,T,Crazy Jealous Guy,"Bobby, what happened, man?
I did it.
What are you talking about?
If I can't have her... no one's gonna.
Get away from her!
Bobby, what's going on?
Look. It was an accident, okay? I was so stupid.
Stacy, he hit you!
He didn't hurt me.
Your nose is bleeding. Let's go inside.
This is between us, okay?
You are not going with him. You hear me? He treats you like crap!
Well, you don't know what he's been through! Besides, you don't give up on someone you love.
You call that love? Then I don't even think he likes you!
Well, then you don't know what love is!
What the hell's wrong with you?
What? What did I do?
Look at you, showing your ass to everybody. Here,
you want every guy in school coming on to you? Is that how much you care about me?
Bobby, no; I wore this for you.
For me? You look like a slut.
But you said you loved my legs.
So you decide to embarrasses me like this?
No, Bobby nobody thinks that I would even...
You just care about what I think. Cause here is some news for you: nobody else cares about you. Nobody else wants you.
But I don't want anybody else.
Bobby? Bobby? Bobby, Please don't be mad, I didn't mean to hurt...
You want everyone to hear you? To see you cry, you wanna embarrasses me again?
No, I didn't want to do anything. Bobby I wore this for you. Because I love you. Don't you even remember-
Would you stop? What are you trying-
Great. You happy now?
Oh my God. What are you doing in here? How'd you get here?
I had to see you. Stacy, I swear...
No, I want you out, now.
I- I don't blame you for hating me. Or for wanting to break up. I just- Let me explain.
What do you mean, explain what?
About my family. I ju- I didn't want you to know. See, my dad's a drunk. Alright? And he'd come home yelling, almost every night. Find something wrong, Some dirty dish. Or some stupid thing my mother would say then he'd beat her. And then I'd lie there in bed listening to her cry. There was nothing I could do. But she'd never leave the bastard. Then she started drinking. And then everything got so out of control.
Why didn't you tell me?
Because that's not us. Don't you see? We're different. All we have is so much better then that. When I think about losing you,
If only my family weren't so screwed up.
Yeah, mine too. It's like my mom is jealous of what we have. She doesn't understand anything.
No one can. That's why we gotta stick together. Cause when you love somebody, you never give up on them.
Don't worry about me; I'm not giving up.
Hey.
Am I too early? Or should I just...
No, no, you're fine. Uh, I always lift after practice. You can spot me.
Spot you?
Yeah! Yeah, c'mon. I'll show ya.
You keep you're hands on the bar for balance. In case I lose my grip.
But isn't it heavy?
Not yet.
Um, you know about what happened at the gym, on Friday,
It...
It was pretty cool.
It was?
Yeah, most girls, that look at ya but don't say what their thinking.
They don't?
No, so when somebody's honest about the way the feel, it's good."
Johnny Farrell,T,Crazy Jealous Guy,"You do hate me, don't you, Johnny?
I don't think you have any idea of how much.
Hate is a very exciting emotion. Haven't you noticed? Very exciting. I hate you too, Johnny. I hate you so much I think I'm going to die from it. Darling...
I think I'm going to die from it.
You two kids love each other pretty terribly, don't you?
I hate her!
That's what I mean. It's the most curious love-hate pattern I've ever had the privilege of witnessing.
Would it interest you to know how much I hate you, Johnny?
Very much.
I hate you so much that I would destroy myself to take you down with me.
Statistics show that there are more women in the world than anything else. Except insects.
It is a most faithful and obedient friend: it is silent when I want it to be silent, but talks when I want to talk.
Is it that your idea of a friend?
That is my idea of a friend.
You must lead a gay life.
She still didn't believe I wasn't coming back. Every night she got all dressed up... and waited. But a girl like Gilda couldn't stand not knowing the why of things, so she decided to swallow her pride and came to see me. It was wonderful.
I want to go with you, Gilda. Please take me. I know I did everything wrong...
Isn't it wonderful? Nobody has to apologize, because we were both stinkers, weren't we? Isn't it wonderful?
Wonderful.
You're a lucky man.
I make my own luck.
I hated her so I couldn't get her out of my mind for a minute.
Pardon me, but your husband is showing.
Doesn't it bother you at all that you're married?
What I want to know is, does it bother you?
I thought we agreed that women and gambling didn't mix.
My wife does not come under the category of women, Johnny.
To me a dollar was a dollar in any language. It was my first night in the Argentine and I didn't know much about the local citizens, but I knew about American sailors, and I knew I better get out of there."
Takeo,T,Crazy Jealous Guy,Croakkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk!
Guy,T,Crazy Jealous Guy,"What I am concerned with is detail. I asked you go get me a packet of Sweet-N-Low. You bring me back Equal. That isn't what I asked for. That isn't what I wanted. That isn't what I needed and that shit isn't going to work around here.
I, I just thought...
You thought. Do me a fucking favor. Shut up, listen, and learn. Look, I know that this is your first day and you don't really know how things work around here, so I will tell you. You have no brain. No judgement calls are necessary. What you think means nothing. What you feel means nothing. You are here for me. You are here to protect my interests and to serve my needs. So, while it may look like a little thing to you, when I ask for a packet of Sweet-N-Low, that's what I want. And it's your responsibility to see that I get what I want.
Get me packed up, I gotta get to services.
What services? Who died?
No one... yet. It's Yom Kippur, you idiot.
Oh, I didn't realize Ackerman was a Jewish name.
It's Jewish enough, especially when the big players are involved. Besides, I have a sudden need to atone for my sins.
How about lunch?
Well, I'm not allowed to take lunch, Buddy doesn't believe in it.
You wanna talk big directors? Think Attenborough, think Spielberg, think Lean.
Lean's dead.
No he's not, don't you ever say that. He's just unavailable.
That's a bagel stain.
Bagel stain?
I put too much cream cheese on Buddy's bagel and he threw it at me. But I learned a very valuable lesson... never put too much cream cheese on Buddy's bagel.
I've handled the phones, I've juggled the bimbos, I, I've put up with the tyrants, the yellers, the screamers. I've done more than you can even imagine in that small mind of yours. I paid my dues!
I didn't spend *one year*...
and I spent ten!
Fuck! Fuck! That's it, I'm screwed. It's over.
Ah, relax. He always does that. That's his thing. Tomorrow, he'll ask you for an Equal. You can't win. It's a lose-lose situation. The trick is to have everything ready.
Let me ask you a question: why do you want this?
I don't know. It's just something I've always wanted to do.
Oh bullshit. Is it the money? There are easier ways to get rich. Girls? I'll float you a twenty and give you a number to call right now. Why the movies?"
Blue,T,Crazy Jealous Guy,"Did you lose your fight, huh?
No, I just found it.
You suddenly forgot what it is we do here?
I teach them to survive 'you'.
I don't want her to remember a thing.
Don't worry, she won't even remember her name when I'm done with her."
Tony Wendice,T,Crazy Jealous Guy,"How do you go about writing a detective story?
Well, you forget detection and concentrate on crime. Crime's the thing. And then you imagine you're going to steal something or murder somebody.
Oh, is that how you do it? It's interesting.
Yes, I usually put myself in the criminal's shoes and then I keep asking myself, uh, what do I do next?
Do you really believe in the perfect murder?
Mmm, yes, absolutely. On paper, that is. And I think I could, uh, plan one better than most people; but I doubt if I could carry it out.
Oh? Why not?
Well, because in stories things usually turn out the way the author wants them to; and in real life they don't... always.
Hmm.
No, I'm afraid my murders would be something like my bridge: I'd make some stupid mistake and never realize it until I found everybody was looking at me.
It's funny to think that just a year ago, I sat in that Knightsbridge Pub actually planning to murder her. And I might have done it, if I hadn't seen something that changed my mind.
Well? What did you see?
I saw you.
People don't commit murder on credit.
By the way does Mrs. Van Dorn know about ""Mr. Adams"" or ""Mr. Wilson"" and Miss Wallace? You were planning to marry Mrs. Van Dorn, weren't you?
Smart, aren't you?
No, not really. I've just had time to think things out. Put myself in your position. That's why I know you're going to agree.
What makes you think I'll agree?
For the same reason that a donkey with a stick behind him and a carrot in front always goes forwards and not backwards.
Tell me about the carrot.
At exactly three minutes to eleven, you'll enter the house through the street door. You'll find the key to this door under the stair carpet here.
The fifth step?
That's the one. Go straight to the window, and hide behind the curtains. At exactly eleven o'clock, I shall go to the telephone in the hotel to call my boss. I shall dial the wrong number. This number. That's all I shall do.
As you said Mark, it might work out on paper, but congratulations, Inspector. Oh, by the way... How about you, Margot?
Yes, I could do with something.
Mark?
So could I.
I suppose you're still on duty, Inspector.
Well, that's the first and last reunion I ever went to. What a murderous thug I look.
Yes, you do, rather.
You know the police would only have to trace one of these notes back to you to hang us both from the same rope?
They won't. For a whole year I've been cashing an extra twenty pounds a week, always in fivers. I then change them for those at my leisure.
Let me see your bank statement.
By all means. Don't touch.
Turn back a page.
Ah, your balance has dropped by over a thousand pounds during the year. Suppose the police ask you about that?
I go dog-racing twice a week.
They'll check your bookmaker!
Like you, I always bet on the ""Tote."" Satisfied?
I'm so glad we don't have to go to Maureen's; she's such a filthy cook.
We had a burglary last night, and Margot was attacked. No, she's all right. But the man was killed, and the police are here now. And don't laugh... they're suggesting that Margot killed him intentionally!
I wouldn't say that if I were you, sir.
You know, I think I must have seen you somewhere since we left Cambridge.
Ever been to Wimbledon?
That's it! Wendice. Tony Wendice. What's all this about ""Fisher""?
What's all this about ""Lesgate""?
Would you like a cigar?
Where's the nearest police station?
Opposite the church, two minutes walk.
Suppose I walk there now.
What would you tell them?
Everything.
Everything? All about ""Mr. Adams"" and ""Mr. Wilson""?
I should simply tell them that you're trying to blackmail me into...
...Into?
...murdering your wife.
I almost wish you would. When she heard that we'd have the biggest laugh of our lives.
Aren't you forgetting something?
Am I?
You've told me quite a lot tonight.
What of it?
Suppose I tell them how you followed her to that studio in Chelsea and watched them cooking spaghetti and all that rubbish. Wouldn't that ring a bell?
Oh, it certainly would. They'd assume you followed her there yourself.
Me? Why should I?
Why should you steal her handbag? Why should you write her all those blackmail notes? Can you prove you didn't? You certainly can't prove I did. It'll be a straight case of your word against mine.
That'd puzzle them, wouldn't it? What could you say?
I should simply say that you came here tonight, half-drunk, and tried to borrow money on the strength that we were at college together. When I refused, you mentioned something about a letter belonging to my wife. As far as I could make out, you were trying to sell it to me. I gave you what money I had, and you gave me the letter. It has your fingerprints on it, remember? Then you said if I went to the police you'd tell some crazy story about my wanting you to murder my wife. Before you go any further, old boy, do consider the inconvenience. You see, I'm quite well known, and there'd be pictures of you as well. And sooner or later there'd be a deputation of landladies and lodgers who would step forward and testify as to your character. And someone is almost certain to have seen you with Miss Wallace. You were careful not to be seen around with her, I noticed. You usually met in out-of-the-way places where you wouldn't be recognized.
One thousand pounds in cash.
For a murder?
For a few minutes work, that's all it is. And no risk, I guarantee. That ought to appeal to you. You've been skating on pretty thin ice.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You ought to know. It's in all the papers. Middle aged woman found dead due to an overdose of something. Apparently, she'd been taking the stuff for quite some time, and nobody knows where she got it. But we know, don't we? Poor Miss Wallace.
This thousand pounds. Where is it?
It's in a small attaché case in a check room.
Where?
Somewhere in London. Of course we don't meet again. As soon as you've delivered the goods, I shall mail you the checkroom ticket and the key to the case. You take this hundred pounds on account.
When would this take place?
Tomorrow night.
Tomorrow? Not a chance! I've got to think this over.
It has to be tomorrow. I've arranged things that way.
Where?
Approximately where you're standing now.
Don't make me stay home. You know how I hate doing nothing.
Doing nothing? Why there are hundreds of things you can do. Have you written to Peggy, thanking her for the weekend? And what about those clippings? It's an ideal opportunity.
Well I like that. You two go gallivanting while I stay home and do those boring clippings.
Would any of you fellows have the right time?
Yes, I have. It's seven minutes past eleven.
I make it only just after that.
My watch has stopped. I must have over wound it.
So, as I was saying...
Excuse me, old boy, I have to call my boss.
What makes you think he came in by this door?
His shoes.
His shoes?
The ground was soaking wet last night. If he'd come in by the garden, he'd have left mud all over the carpet. As it is, he didn't leave any marks at all, because he wiped his shoes on the front doormat.
How can you tell?
It's a fairly new mat, and some of its fibers came off on his shoes.
Oh, but surely...
And there was a small tar stain on the mat, and some of the fibers show that as well. There is no question about it.
Oh, there you are. We thought you were never coming. What have you been up to?
I'm sorry darling, but the boss came in just as I was leaving.
Tony, this is Mark Halliday.
Hello Mark.
Hello.
How about coming with me to a stag party?
A stag party?
Yes, some American boys have been playing tennis all over the country. We're giving them a sort of farewell dinner.
Sounds great, but I'm not much of a tennis player.
Doesn't matter. You know New York and all that.
Darling, Mark's coming to the party tomorrow night.
Oh good. You better drop in here first and have a drink.
That's the idea.
Yes, alright. Well I'll try and get a taxi.
No, we can usually pick one up. So long, darling.
Enjoy yourself.
So long, Tony.
Good night.
Oh, by the way, will you be bringing the car with you?
Uh... I'm afraid I can't tonight, it's...
That doesn't matter. I had a good look at it anyway. Oh, you might want to bring the registration book and any necessary papers.
Yes, of course.
I don't see why we can't settle this whole thing here and now, provided you drop the price.
I'm afraid that's quite out of the question.
Well, we'll see what a couple of drinks can do. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Good morning, Sir. I'm Chief Inspector Hubbard, in charge of criminal investigation of this division.
Oh, I think we gave your sergeant all the necessary information.
Yes, I've seen his report of course, but there are a few things I'd like to get firsthand.
There is evidence however that he was blackmailing you.
Blackmail?
Yes, I'm afraid it's true, Tony.
And you suggest that he came in by the window. And we know that he came in by that door.
But he can't have come in that way. That door was locked. And there are only two keys. My husband had his with him, and mine was in my handbag. Here.
You could have let him in.
Just a minute. I'm supposed to have come in through these windows. Suppose they'd been locked?
It wouldn't matter. You see, she often takes a walk around the garden before she goes to bed, and she usually forgets to lock up when she gets back. That's what I shall tell the police.
Yes, but she may say that...
But she isn't going to say anything, is she?
I've been following you ever since.
Why?
Well, I was hoping that sooner or later I might catch you at something and be able to, ah...
Blackmail me?
Influence you.
By the way, how do you know my car is for sale?
The mechanic at your garage told me.
That's odd. I don't think I mentioned it to anyone there.
Well, I stopped there one day for a fill up and told him that I was looking for a new American car to buy and he gave me your phone number. It is for sale, isn't it?
Yes, of course.
Well, I refuse to discuss the price until you've had at least three brady's.
Hey, I warn you. I drive a hard bargain, drunk or sober."
Steven Taylor,T,Crazy Jealous Guy,"You should thank me. Artists are always appreciated more after they're dead!
When you wake up tomorrow, all this will seem like a bad dream.
What if there is no tomorrow?
You know better than that.
That's not happiness to see me is it?
try surprised.
Fucking my wife.
I don't know...
I think it's about time you called me Steven.
We're in love, sir.
That's it? You steal the crown jewel of a man's soul, and your only excuse is some candy ass Hallmark card sentiment? Even if it were true, that's not good enough!
What weren't true?
She is in love with you, buddy. You're in business.
What the hell are saying?
I'm saying you did not meet my wife by chance, I'm saying is you didn't study at Berkley, I'm saying is you learned to paint by doing three to six at Soledad State Prison, for relieving a widow in San Francisco of her life savings, your second conviction, if I'm not mistaken your real name is Winton Lagrange, which I'd rather like, born to pure trailer trash in Barstow California, warded to the court at the age of 10, you went from pick pocket, to car thief to con man until you found out you had a way with the softer sex no doubt looking for that mother you can barely remember, life made up of completely depressing little scams, until now.
Where'd you get all that?
All that is for sale, Winston. Yhe hell of it is that you're not half bad with a brush.
Thank you. Call it rehabilitation.
Call it a con and my wife is the grand prize but you set your sights a little too high this time/
She loves me.
She loves ""David Shaw"", your invention. not that it matters because you made a fundamental miscalculation. Now you play it out, love conquers all, Emily divorces me, she marries you. Given your history, her advisors are going to insist on a prenup, so you might storm the castle but you're not getting the keys to the treasure room ever!
I don't care about that.
The petty swindler, doesn't care about a trust fund that can buy fucking Barstow? Why don't you cut the shit? You care or we would not be having this conversation, the only thing that's stopping you from bolting out right now is bad genes and greed.
Now what?
Choices, I can tell Emily exactly who you are, and life will imitate art you become a starving painter, game over.
Or?
Or you can cash out.
Cash out?
Half a million dollars, tax free.
Just for walking away from her?
I said ""tax free"", I didn't say ""free.""
Excuse me sir, can you spare me 400 grand?
I don't see why not.
There you are. And how was your day? Any progress in saving the world?
I'm working on it.
He must have put it back on his way in, didn't plan on that did you?
Young David. He was... he was very unpredictable.
When's this card game of yours?
Tomorrow evening.
Tomorrow? No fucking way!
What happens if the plan goes to hell?
It won't.
How's *that* for wet work?
What do you want?
The rest of my money.
You didn't fulfill your end of the bargain, did you?
So?
So, what do I get?
You get the ""super fine thing"", might even call it the ""legitimately sublime.""
What exactly is this ""super fine thing?""
You're looking at it, it's called ""time outside of prison"" old partner, and you can't beat it with a stick.
Exactly how much time does four hundred thousand dollars buy me?
Whatever the market will bear.
It'll take me a few days.
You've got four hours.
That's impossible and you know it.
I'm sure someone with your resume will be able to come up with an alibi in no time.
I'm sure someone with my resume would just take the money and run.
I'll bet you four hundred thousand more you don't.
We'll work it out? Let me tell you something, you work it out on your fucking own! This is over!
You're not leaving me, the only way you leave me is dead!
What's the five hundred grand for?
Killing my wife.
Emily?
One hundred thousand now, four hundred thousand after cash and carry.
You're out of your mind.
Not really.
Why?
I appreciate your curiosity but my agenda doesn't concern you.
What if I go to straight to Emily and tell her all this?
That'd be my word against yours, Winston.
What if I go to the cops?
Have you ever been to Boca Raton Florida? there was a lady down there that was carrying on with a much younger man he was a hell of a tennis player, anyway when the affair ended he disappeared, along with the lady's bearer bonds, an acquaintance of mine has a photograph of the suspect and all police need is a name, as in strike three, fifteen years no parole.
But why did you put his key on my key chain?
David threatened violence from the very beginning so when I saw the body lying in the kitchen I'm sure it was him none of the doors have been forced open so I assumed he had your key.
But when? I had just used it to come that evening.
Are you sure? He used your key? Because if memory serves me right, the door was wide open I saw you walk in.
Maybe.
In which case he could've taken your key the day before, did you see him the day before?
Yes.
So I went through his pockets and found what I thought was your key and I reacted I grabbed a screwdriver and jimmied the door and put back in his pocket and took what I thought was your key and put it on your keychain I am so sorry for having to put you through this it was the only thing I could do.
Can you ever forgive me?
I already have.
We have to go to the police.
I don't think this is the time for brutal honesty. I've tampered evidence in a homicide. I paid off a blackmail. I'm in way over my head and so are you, David can say anything he wants. He could say I hired him to kill you or he could say he blackmailed us, the happily married wealthy couple in which case it appeared we killed that poor bastard thinking it was David all depends how he wants to play it.
What about the man that I killed?
You think that has anything to do with David?
It must.
Do you have any idea how many burglaries are committed each day in this city? I don't think so.
What are we going to do now?
We're going to have to disentangle ourselves from your artist friend is there anything in his loft that can link David to you and I?
My ring.
I thought you said it was being repaired?
That was a lie I left it by the bed.
Is there anything else?
Isn't that enough?
I'll get it.
There was a robbery in the building last year probable means of entrance is the driveway gate that granite facade creates a blind sport in the surveillance cameras it wasn't corrected for aesthetic reasons, you enter as I leave at eight o clock for my card game tomorrow night I'm not going to pull out of the driveway until its clear the gate takes five seconds to close you have the right side of the wall as I drive by then you enter the stairs and use the service elevator the key to the front door also works on the service entrance I'm going to take the key from Emily's purse and hide it behind the pipe in the stairway my key implicates me her key could've been lost or stolen in any case she's not going to be around to explain, the lock to the service entrance is always dead bolted she won't notice it even if she checks you'll be in the stairway at nine thirty, by that time Emily will be taking a bath because that's what she does on nights I play cards the phone in the kitchen is a separate telephone line exactly ten o clock I'll call here when she answers the phone and the tragic confrontation will happen which will appear to be a spur of the moment bludgeon rifle the jewelry in the bedroom disable the service entrance lock and make it look like it was jimmied put the key back behind the pipe and leave the building the same way you came in.
The key to the dead man's apartment was on my key chain, someone put it there after I killed him and there's only one person in the world that could've done that.
Me.
Why?
To protect you.
From what?
Your lover, unless somebody else sent me these pictures, he called me here at the office two months ago, bragged about how hard you fell for him, he shelled out a hundred thousand dollars but he wants more.
For what?
Breaking it off.
I don't believe you.
Did he mention Belize? That's where he took all the other ones, This guy was quite the aphrodisiac with lowly limited means he learned to paint in a state prison not at Berkley I don't know where we go from here Emily I don't know if ""we"" is an option I do know I have done everything in my power to protect you from this career criminal you let crawl into our bed.
Why didn't you tell me?
Because I was sure you were in love with him, were you?
I thought I was I can't even imagine what I put you through, is this why your business is in trouble? Banks and margin calls?
How did you know?
It's true, isn't it?
Yes, it's true but I can always make money that's the fun part, there's a god damn sea of it out there but there's only one of you.
Come on Steve, a man with your résumé can come up with four hundred grand in no time.
Where?
My place, you don't show up with the cash, I'll mail the recording I have as ""Steven's greatest hits.""
I understand.
Be fucking sure you do.
In case you forgot Elliot, it's a ""zero sum game, I just don't think you got the balls for it.
The hell with you Taylor, this time tomorrow neither one of us will have any balls left.
Just don't panic.
you're damn right I am.
so what's it to you? You dropped $50 million in a day?
do you know how fast 50 can become 500?
what's the spot rate?
you look at it, we're sitting at ground zero and you're telling me to ""think happy thoughts""?
I don't want you to go tonight
what's wrong?
I need to talk to you
it's too late, they'll never get anyone to fill in, besides I beat them pretty bad last week, they're all going to want their money back.
so who was he?
somebody I met at ""Berkley""
can he be connected to you?
not anymore
you got any idea who you're fucking with?
yeah, you're the guy who hired me to kill your wife because you couldn't the ""wet work"" yourself, neither could I
so how do you know he didn't talk to someone?
Ron was a good man
not quite good enough
ok, what's plan B?
well it's a little coincidental if there's another attempt on her life
gee you think?
so, we wait
for what?
I'll let you know
Here's to ""stolen moments"".
Rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated.
The spreads are ""blowing out"" and the way things look in Europe, it could turn into a real bloodbath.
So, what are we talking?
We're talking at least a hundred and fifty basis points.
Bundesbank will have to tag along, so your Yen and other positions are going to get hammered.
So, what's our exposure?
Based on my preliminary model?
Yes, no frills.
Think Chernobyl.
David, hi, it's Steven Taylor here, I'm finishing up a little early today and I thought I'd come by and check out your work, let's say about six if that ""flies"" with you, why don't you give me a call at my office here 544-1817, I look forward to seeing you.
Want a drink?
No, I'm ok, unless you want another one?
No, I'm fine.
I asked you to meet me here because my place is kind of hard to find.
Like in the ""illegal"" loft space?
That's one way to put it.
I feel like I'm knee deep in bohemian cache, lead on.
your right his very talented
did you buy anything?
I made him an ""offer""
and?
and his ""chewing"" on it"
Geoffrey Clifton,T,Crazy Jealous Guy,"My darling. I'm waiting for you. How long is the day in the dark? Or a week? The fire is gone, and I'm horribly cold. I really should drag myself outside but then there'd be the sun. I'm afraid I waste the light on the paintings, not writing these words. We die. We die rich with lovers and tribes, tastes we have swallowed, bodies we've entered and swum up like rivers. Fears we've hidden in - like this wretched cave. I want all this marked on my body. We are the real countries. Not boundaries drawn on maps with the names of powerful men. I know you'll come carry me out to the Palace of Winds. That's what I've wanted: to walk in such a place with you. With friends, on an earth without maps. The lamp has gone out and I'm writing in the darkness.
You're wearing the thimble.
Of course, you idiot. I always wear it; I've always worn it; I've always loved you.
Will we be alright?
Yes. Yes, absolutely.
""Yes"" is a comfort. ""Absolutely"" is not.
You speak so many bloody languages, and you never want to talk.
I just wanted you to know: I'm not missing you yet.
You will.
Promise me you'll come back for me.
I promise, I'll come back for you. I promise, I'll never leave you.
What do you love?
What do I love?
Say everything.
Hm, let's see... Water. Fish in it. And hedgehogs; I love hedgehogs.
And what else?
Marmite - I'm addicted. And baths. But not with other people. Islands. Your handwriting. I could go on all day.
Go on all day.
My husband.
What do you hate most?
A lie. What do you hate most?
Ownership. Being owned. When you leave, you should forget me.
Am I K in your book? I think I must be.
When were you most happy?
Now.
And when were you least happy?
Now.
Let me tell you about winds. There is a, a whirlwind from southern Morrocco, the aajej, against which the fellahin defend themselves with knives. And there is the... the ghibli, from Tunis...
The ""ghibli""?
the ghibli, which rolls and rolls and rolls and produces a... a rather strange nervous condition. And then there is the... the harmattan, a red wind, which mariners call the sea of darkness. And red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of England, apparently producing... showers so dense that they were mistaken for blood.
Fiction! We have a house on that coast and it has never, never rained blood.
No, it's all true. Herodotus, your friend. He writes about it. And he writes about... a, a wind, the simoon, which a nation thought was so evil they declared war on it and marched out against it. In full battle dress. Their swords raised.
I wanted to meet the man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives.
This - what is this?
It's a folk song.
Arabic.
No, no. It's Hungarian. My daijka sang it to me when I was a child growing up in Budapest.
It's beautiful. What's it about?
Szerelem means love. And the story, well, there's this Hungarian count. He's a wanderer. He's a fool. And for years he's on some kind of a quest for... who knows what. And then one day, he falls under the spell of a mysterious English woman. A harpy, who beats him, and hits him, he becomes her slave, and he sews her clothes, and worships...
Stop it! Stop it! You're always beating me!
Bastard! You bastard, I believed you! You should be my slave.
I'm impressed you can sew.
Good.
You sew very badly.
Well, you don't sew at all.
A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she shouldn't admit to it.
Do you think you are the only one who feels anything?
Why did you follow me yesterday?
I'm sorry, what?
After the market, you followed me to the hotel.
I was concerned. A woman in that part of Cairo, a European woman, I felt obliged to.
You felt obliged to?
As the wife of one of our party.
So why follow me? Escort me, by all means, but following me is predatory, isn't it?
D'you not come in?
No. I should go home.
Will you please come in?
Mrs. Clifton...
Don't.
I believe you still have my book."
Guy Perkins,D,Big Man On Campus,"All right, all right. Josie.
That's not a theme!
Thank you... No, Josie will have the answer.
Hi, I'm Guy.
Yes, you are a guy. Quite a guy. Oh my. Hey, that rhymes! Yikes. Bikes!
Are you in special-ed? I mean, are you?
A Geek?
You totally just said that out load.
You're not seriously trying to hang out with us at the court, are you Alpo?
Ooh, cheap wine coolers and a fire in a trash can.
Where do I sign up?"
John Tucker,D,Big Man On Campus,"So did you like the flowers?
Sure, if you're into that kinda thing.
Well, cuz, you know, I didn't get a call...
I didn't have a pen.
So you're lab partners with Kate, right? We talk. What's her deal?
Yeah, I don't know. I don't think she's your type.
Girl is my type.
Alright, well then maybe you're not her type. She's into stuff like old school Elvis Costello, she listens to obscure podcasts, she reads Dave Eggers. You know, she's deep, man.
Dude, I'm deep. I'm dating the poetry club.
It's always all about me. John! John! John!
It's like lettin' your best friend sleep in a silk hammock. They're breezy. They don't bind. And they give you just enough swing.
You don't drink an '82 Bordeaux just because it's sitting on your shelf.
What the hell?
I think this belongs to you, Coach. I found it in my bed.
Coach, make her let go.
Let go.
""Live and let live"" is what I say, Tucker. Takes all kinds to build a freeway. But I am not equipped for this kind of weirdness THIS CLOSE TO THE PLAYOFFS!
I guess it was four instead of three. Sorry.
Show's over ladies. Back to your rooms.
Show's over! Back to your rooms.
I don't think she's your type...
Girl is my type!
Maybe I come on too strong, but... I don't know who else to be. I just have to put my whole heart into things.
You...
I'm sorry!
...little... MARCH!
John, what are you wearing?
Dude, those are for ladies.
Did you write down my number yesterday? Because I didn't get a call last night..
Well I didn't have a pen.."
Woody Deane,D,Big Man On Campus,"Tits? Oh my God! I have tits! I have TWO tits!
You look like a common prostitute.
Damn... I was going for high class hooker.
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art more lovely and... temperate. Rough winds... blah blah blah... There's something in there I can't remember. And, uh... yadda yadda yadda. I'm sorry, I... I'm no Shakespeare. My guess, Romeo wasn't much of a quarterback either, right?
Nice penis.
Woody, you... you crying?
Yeah.
What's... what's wrong?
I'm sorry. I just found out I lost my virginity in a trailer park.
What're you wearing?
Chinos and an Oxford cotton button down I found it in the back of your closet.
Which is exactly where it's meant to stay until another one of my relatives croaks.
Nonsense. You can't beat a classic look.
So we've got the wrong lives, but sometimes you just got to get on with life. Let things fall into place.
Ah, it's tough enough getting these damn things off! How the hell does anyone know how to get these freaking things on?
But chew on this: While archetypal outsiders such as myself rarely fit comfortably into high school environments, THIS is as good as your life will get: The big football star and his vacuous cheerleader girlfriend.
HEAD cheerleader.
Hm. Because, let's face it, the old grey matter ain't exactly top-range, now is it, Woodster. So you'll end up with a job in Spachlor World, with your Dad, and probably marry Breanna here, but soon you start drinking to numb this aching feeling you have inside. And, you fast-forward a few years, and you're a drunk, fat, depressed guy at a bar talking about the good old days, while your little wife, whose looks and stuff have gone to doodoo, is propping up her own self-esteam by indulging in squalid sexual encounters with your friends behind your back.
What friends?
I'm guessing most of 'em. Have a good day.
What exactly is it that people like me don't get?
People like ME!
Then educate me, PLEASE.
Okay. We like to play ball. Maybe we're even pretty good at it. So... maybe we get accepted at some second-rate, shit-kicker college, or maybe we go work for our dad at the spatula store. Who knows. But what we don't get is a great job, a big apartment in the city, and a Yale education.
I'm a loser, I'm trouble and I'm stupid. It's basic genetics. Can't help it.
Funny... never took you for a quitter.
That no racket! That's Mystikal!
Nice grab, Horse. How's it hangin'?
To the floor, my friend. Now what's say we shift this baby into warp drive, huh? Wancha to feel the wind blowin' through the hair in your fine, muscular ass.
Think about it, Harry. Are you willing to trade the love of a good woman for the cheap thrill of a tawdry one-night stand?
Can we just keep playing football, please?
Sure, as long as you keep my dick out of your butt.
Come here, dumb jock.
Try and stop me, pencil-neck."
Van Wilder,D,Big Man On Campus,"Worrying is like a rocking chair. It gives you something to do, but it doesn't get you anywhere.
Her name's Naomi. That's ""I moan"" backwards.
You shouldn't take life to seriously. You'll never get out alive.
Write that down.
Sometimes you gotta let your heart lead you... even if you know its someplace you know you're not suppossed to be.
And how many times has your heart led you into the women's locker room?
This would be a first.
Why do I find that hard to believe?
I'm not saying this is the first time I've been in here, just usually it is another part of my anatomy that does the leading.
What is wrong with people today?
It's the internet dude, it fries their brain cells.
Wow, If he's here, who's running hell?
Don't be a fool, wrap your tool.
I've been waiting all these years for you to realize your potential.
That's why you and I had friction? God, I always thought it was 'cause, 'cause I fooled around with your daughter freshman year.
Why, what... You fooled around with my daughter?
What?
Are you stalking me? Because that would be super.
But you know what I've learned in my seven years here at Coolidge... Timmy? I've learned that you can't treat every situation as a life-and-death matter because you'll die a lot of times. Write that down.
I don't have a pen.
Well remember that then. And you know something, Timmy? I think you've got the balls to make it here. Call me nuts, but I believe in you.
All you need is scented candles, massage oil, and Barry White. Write that down. Look at me. No cock pump.
No cock pump. Barry White.
Crazy kids with their crazy VDs.
if you're always thinking about the future, then you kinda forget about the present.
It's a date.
It's an interview, not a date.
Gwen, first dates are interviews.
Hey look. I read the damn article all right. But don't tell anyone because if word gets out that I read my reputation shot to hell.
I'll bet he's a tighty whitey guy.
Excuse me?
White, elastic band, constricting. You can tell a lot about a person by the kind of drawers they wear. Like you - granny panties I bet.
Does that allude to me being the plain, boring type?
Mmmm, no.

I just wanted the visual.
I know Ms. Pac-Man is special. She's fun. She's cute. She swallows.
What are you doing here?
I don't know!
The first day of spring semester. A time to say goodbye to the parents once again, and say hello to a few new student bodies.
I've got a plan. Let's go get fucked up.
Sounds good.
I'd like you to meet Sherri and Terri. Two girls utterly infatuated with men who have larger than normal... medulla oblongatas.
Richard, you rascal, you never told me you were a DIK!
Not that you had to.
Well just take a look at this... ya... doodles... I attended class today just about stayed the whole time too!
I'm glad you went to all your classes today.
And a few that weren't mine, I stepped in the wrong room, liked what I heard... stayed.
That's great!
Mr. Wilder here is quite the collegian. He's in his, what? sixth year?
Actually, its lucky number seven.
All this time I thought I was more to you than a flaccid story.
You must be Gwen, the truck driver
Gwen?
What were you doing up there?
As smashed as I am, I'm pretty sure that was my room...

Wasn't it?
What was that girl, a freshman?
She reads at a sophomore level.
Oh yeah... that's the shit!
You know... I think I'm getting a little coldsore come on... so maybe we shouldn't do this for 3 to 6 weeks?
Shut up, bitch and give me some sugar!
I'm all out of love. I'm so lost without you. I know you were right. Believing for so long.
Dope song. What's it called?
Gwen Used Me For Her Story, Then Married an Ass Wipe... and Ran Over My Heart With a Big Metaphorical Truck. Originally performed by Air Supply.
Is it true this is your seventh year at Coolidge?
Carry the two, yes that's correct.
I'm sorry, fellas. The bakery's closed.
I would like very much to spend my remaining days here as your assistant.
Okay, we're just going do a little word association. Say the first thing that comes to your mind. Milk.
Tit! Oh, mommy. Most Indians would say ""cow"" because they are sacred, but I hear ""milk,"" I think giant jugs. You see, I cannot go home a virgin. I came here to study the great American art of muff diving. To smack clam, munch rug, dine at just one American pink taco stand! You know, I wanted to, how is it, park the porpoise. You know? I want to take it through the car wash, baby. And get it waxed. I want to wax it. Wax it! You know, and air dry. Air dry that shit, yeah! And I would like to be your assistant very much, Mr. Van Wilder.
Congratulations Taj, your first blow job!
Taj, your first blow job!
In my country, a woman's mastery of her gastronomical releases is considered the ultimate aphrodisiac!
Those circus midgets can NOT hold their booze!
I'm sorry, Taj. I'm gonna have to let you go. I don't have the resources to pay for your services anymore.
A good soldier does not leave his commander just because he lies wounded, arms torn off at the sockets, intestines spilling out onto the mud, picked at by the birds. I will stay on at no charge.
Don't be a fool, stay in school!
Take your clothes off.
I'm not taking off my clothes.
Well it is the naked mile run, everybody else is in their birthday suit.
Except that guy.
Nobody even knows we're here.
Au contraire, mon freres.
Whoa, trick or treat. What's going on?
This vaginal discharge won't let us partake in the party.
Graphic.
Gwen, what are you doing here?
You two know each other?
That's my girlfriend, gluteus erecti.
Blue - it brings out your eyes. The kid has killer eyes, not unlike yourself - anyone ever tell you that?
Yes, my boyfriend.
Your boyfriend? What's his name?
I don't think that's any of your business.
You're right
I'm doing a human interest piece... on you.
I'm flattered, I'd love for your piece to be on me.
... But sadly I don't do interviews, never have, never will. Do lunch though.
Well I think it takes a lot more then the kind of underwear one wears to define them as a person.
Like what?
Well, you haven't lived until you've shot-putted blitzed on Jager!""
I want you all over that ball like a fat kid on a cupcake!
Dinner for two. Me and you. Clothing optional.
You think about the future too much and you kinda forget about the present. Obviously.
Doesn't she have a boyfriend?
Details. Only details.
Ok, Wilder. Let's dance.
It's a good day to die, McDoogle.
If Milty Mingleton can shove himself into that weenie bikini, then you don't need to be shy about making your donations to the swim team.
We'll be accepting donations in the form of cash, visa, and full frontal nudity.
What's that intoxicating scent you're wearing Doris?
I have cats.
Meow!
Looks like all he needed was a little TLC
Was that a...
Judges ruling? Uh huh. Yeah.
I do believe that was a joke.
You guys have had the best GPS the last 50 years.
Indeed. But believe it or not, best GPA doesn't get you laid.
Damn well should."
Paul Metzler,"F, D","Brainless Beauty, Big Man On Campus","My leg wasn't bugging me too much and the weather was so nice, and every day after school Lisa and I would go to her house to fuck and have a hot tub.
Dear Lord Jesus, I do not often speak with you and ask for things, but now I really must insist that you help me win the election tomorrow because I deserve it and Paul Metzler doesn't, as you well know. I realize that it was your divine hand that disqualified Tammy Metzler and now I'm asking that you go that one last mile and make sure to put me in office where I belong so that I may carry out your will on earth as it is in heaven. Amen.
Dear God, I know I don't believe in you, but since I'll be starting Catholic school soon, I thought I should at least practice. Let's see, what do I want? I want Lisa to realize what a bitch she is and feel really bad and apologize for how she hurt me and know how much I still love her. In spite of everything, I still want Paul to win the election tomorrow, not that cunt Tracy. Oh, and I also want a really expensive pair of leather pants and someday I wanna be really good friends with Madonna. Love, Tammy.
Dear God, than you for all your blessings. You've given me so many things, like good health, nice parents, a nice truck, and what I'm told is a large penis, and I'm very grateful, but I sure am worried about Tammy. In my heart, I still can't believe she tore down my posters, but sometimes, she does get so weird and angry. Please help her be a happier person because she's so smart and sensitive and I love her so much. Also, I'm nervous about the election tomorrow and I guess I want to win and all, but I know that's totally up to you. You'll decide who the best person is and I'll accept it. And forgive me for my sins, whatever they may be. Amen.
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
Pears.
Pears, good. OK, let's say...
Oh, no wait! Apples.
Apples. Fine.
Let's say all you ever knew were apples. Apples, apples, and more apples. You might think apples were pretty good, even if you got a rotten one every once in a while. But then one day...
...there's an orange. And now you can make a decision, do you want an apple or do you want an orange? That's democracy.
I also like bananas.
I don't why, but Lisa decided she wanted to hurt me, and she knew exactly what to do.
I sure was surprised the day Lisa Flanagan asked me for a ride home and ended up blowing me.
I've wanted this for so long.
Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if I'd actually won the election. Maybe my whole life would be different, like I might never have gone to Yosemite with Greg and Travis.
Or maybe I'd be dead.

Troy Bolton,D,Big Man On Campus,"Well, you sound like you've done a lot of singing, too.
Yeah, my showerhead is very impressed with me.
Do you remember in kindergarten how you'd meet a kid and know nothing about them, then 10 seconds later you're playing like you're best friends, because you didn't have to be anything but yourself?
Yeah.
Singing with you felt like that.
When I was singing with you, I felt like just a girl.
You even look like one too!
Whoa, don't tell me you're good at hoops too.
You know, I once scored 41 points on a league game.
No way.
Mmhmm. Yeah, and on the same day I invented the space shuttle and microwave popcorn.
Ah, microwave popcorn. Haha, very funny.
Look, you're a hoops dude. Not a musical singer person. Have you ever seen Michael Crawford on a cereal box?
Who's Michael Crawford?
Exactly my point. He was the ""Phantom of the Opera"" on Broadway. Now my mom, she's seen that musical 27 times and she put Michael Crawford's picture in our refrigerator. Not on it. IN it. So my point is, if you play basketball, you'll end up on the cereal box. If you sing in musicals, you'll end up in my mom's refrigerator.
Why would she put his picture in your refrigerator?
I don't know, one of her crazy diet ideas. Look, I don't attempt to understand the female mind, Troy.
It's frightening territory.
How can you expect the rest of us to be focused on a game when you're off somewhere in leotards singing 'Twinkle Town'...
No one said *anything* about leotards.
Not yet my friend, but just you wait.

I tried to tell him, Miss Falstaff. I really did.

I... don't know what's going on here, but in any event, it is far too late, and we have not got a pianist.
Well, that's show biz.
We'll sing without a piano.
Oh no you won't. Pianist here, Ms. Darbus.
You *really* don't want to do that.
Oh yes, I *really* do.
Ready on stage!
Oh!
Now *that's* show biz!
Sharpay's kinda cute too.
Yeah, so is a mountain lion, but you don't pet it.
I can't do this, Troy. Not with everyone staring at me...
Hey, hey, hey. Look at me- right at me. Like the first time together, remember...
Like kindergarten.
Callbacks the same day as the game?
And the scholastic decathlon!
Why would they do this?
I smell a rat named Darbus...
Actually, I think it's two rats, neither of them named Darbus.
Do you know something about this... small person?
Miss Darbus might think she's protecting the show, but Ryan and Sharpay are pretty much only concerned with protecting *themselves*.
Do you know what I'm gonna do to those two overmoussed showdogs?
Nothing. We're not gonna do anything to them. Except sing... maybe. All right. Now this is only going to happen; if we all work together... Now who's in?
Oh... an equation.
Did we really fly all this way just to play more basketball?
, :
Yeah.
, :
Yeah.
In my other schools, I was the freaky math girl. It's cool coming here and being... whoever I wanna be. So, you wanna do the callbacks?
Hey, just call me freaky callback boy!
Hey.
I don't...
Believe it.
Well me...
Either. But how?
Well my mom's company transfered her here to Alberquerque.
You're my guys and this is our team. Gabriella is not important. I'll forget about her. I'll forget the audition and we'll go out and get that champion for the team. Everybody happy now?
Behold lunkhead basketball man.
From our team to yours.
G-O-D-R-A-M-A-C-L-U-B
Exclamation point.
Well, looks like us Wildcats are in for an interesting afternoon.
Go, go-go dray, go drame?
Drame?
You're the playmaker... not a singer... right?
Did you ever think that maybe I could be both?
Hey! How how you doing?
Well, listen, there's something I want to talk to you about.
and here it is. I know what it's like to carry a load with your friends. I get it. You've got your boys, Troy. It's okay. So we're good.
Good about what? I was gonna talk to you about the final callbacks.
I don't wanna do the callbacks either. I mean who are we trying to kid? You've got your team and now I've got mine. I'll do the scholastic decathlon and you win the championships. It's where we belong.
Go Wildcats.
But I...
Me neither.
Gabriella?
That's travelling. No, that's really bad travelling.
I gotta get my, get my head in the game.
You gotta get'cha, get'cha, get'cha, get'cha head in the game.
When's the big game?
Uh, two weeks.
You are so dedicated, just like me. I hope you come watch me in the musical. Promise? Toodles.
Toodles.
Hey! How's it going? So anyways
Dream? Do you remember the night before?
No, all I remember is like pink jelly.
Coach said to fake right and break left / Watch out for the pick and keep an eye on defense / Gotta run the give and go and take the ball to the hole / And don't be afraid to shoot the outside ""J"" / Just keep your head in the game / Just keep ya head in the game.
The Wildcats' superstar is... afraid?
No, no, I'm not afraid. I'm just... scared.
I'll call you, I'll call you tomorrow.
Yeah.
Here put your number in. Here.
You too.
There you go. Well, just, so you know singing with you was the most fun I've had on this entire vacation. So, uh, where do you live?
Gabriella.
Okay, now we will only be able to do this if we all work together.
I'll sing with her.
Troy Bolton? Where is your sports posse, or whatever you call it?
Uhh, team.
Dad, did you ever think about trying something new, but were afraid of what your friends might think?
What, you mean like going left? You're doing great!
Look, that music in those shows isn't hip-hop, okay, or rock, or anything essential to culture. It's all show music. It's all costumes and makeup... oh, dude, it's frightening.
Yeah, I know. I just thought it would be a good laugh.
Hey, the whole team's htting the gym for free period, what do you want us to run?
I can't - I, uh, have to catch up on, uh, homework.
What? It's only the second day back, even I'm not even behind on homework yet. And I've been behind on homework since preschool.
That's hilarious. I'll catch you later?
What spell has this elevated IQ temptress girl cast that suddenly makes you wanna be in a musical?
Look, I just did it. Who cares?
Who cares? How about your most loyal best friend?
Should I go for it? I better shake this. Yikes.
What's up?
What's up? Oh let's see, um, you miss free period workout yesterday to audition for some heinous musical, and now suddenly people are confessing. Yeah, Zeke, Zeke is baking. Crème brûlée.
Oh. What's that?
Oh, it's a creamy custard-like filling with a caramelized surface, it's really satisfying.
Oh, cool.
Shut *up*, Zeke!
So dude, you know that school musical thing? Umm, is it true you get extra credit just for auditioning?
Who cares?
You know it's always good to get extra credit, for... college.
Do you ever think Lebron James or Shaquille O'Neil auditioned for their school musical?
Maybe?
Dad, detention was my fault. Not hers.
You haven't missed a practice in three years. That girl shows up...
That girl is named Gabriella. And she's very nice.
Well, helping you miss practice doesn't make her very nice. Not in my book, or your team's.
And you're not gonna hear me sing, guys, 'cause Gabriella won't even talk to me. And I don't know why.
Um, we do.
Here, I baked this fresh this morning. You might want to try some before you hear the rest.
The team voted you the winning ball.
Thanks, thanks a lot man.
Well, I guess I better go find my Mom and wish her a ""Happy New Year.""
Right, me too. Not your mom, my mom... and dad.
She has an amazing voice.
Perhaps the next musicale.
Now that's impossible.
What's impossible, Troy? I wouldn't think ""impossible"" was even in your vocabulary.
I thought you were my friends! Win together, lose together, teammates.
But suddenly the girl and the singing."
Mike Dexter,"D, AR","Big Man On Campus, Jerk Jock","Who's gonna want you now?

You... have to come with me. There's this chick... there's these two chicks... they're triplets, man. You're not going to believe what they're doing. Not because I made it up or anything but because it is so... unbelievable. Come on out to the pool house, 'cause they told me to tell you... they want you to watch. So, come out... the pool house, come on...
I'm a loser. I broke up with the hottest girl in school, my friends all sold me out... and somebody in there just called me a fag!

No, women. College women. Women with no curfew, women on the pill, women... women, bro. We are staring into the future here. And the future is women.

I wish, bro. I can't even get digits as a freshman.
Shut up! Come on, you can tell me.
Seriously, man. I thought college was gonna be a 24-7 orgy. Hell, that's even why I broke up with Janeen before I left.
S-so, what happened?
College chicks are totally different, bro. They're all serious and shit. They all talk about world issues and ""ecolomological"" crap. They all wanna date older guys.
Yeah, but... not all of 'em, right?
Way it goes. Hell, I even tried crawling back to Janeen. She was all cozy with some senior. He's a pre-med. They ALL are. Guys like us... we are a dime a dozen.
Speaking of which, you still with that Amanda chick? She was a prize piece if I ever saw one.
Yeah,
me and Amanda. Definitely. Yep.
You're lucky, bro.
I sure am.
Stay with her. It's the best advice I can give you.
Oh, that, and bring rubber flip-flops in the shower. I got warts all over my feet.
Take it easy, Trip! Trip McNeely! All right...
Have I got some news for you.
Really? What's that?
That I, recently, became single.
And?
Well, I just remember Jeff Garner saying a little something about you girls thinking I was the hottest senior in school.
Yeah, heh, heh. And, I remember Jeff Garner saying that, uh, you told him we were skanky.
He told you that?

Hey, where are the white women at?
What did you expect? ""Welcome, sonny""? ""Make yourself at home""? ""Marry my daughter""? You've got to remember that these are just simple farmers. These are people of the land. The common clay of the new West. You know... morons.
The drunk in number two must be awake.
Are we awake?
We're not sure. Are we... black?
Yes, we are.
Then we're awake... but we're very puzzled.
I better go check out this Mongo character.
Oh no, don't do that, don't do that. If you shoot him, you'll just make him mad.
Well, it got so that every piss-ant prairie punk who thought he could shoot a gun would ride into town to try out the Waco Kid. I must have killed more men than Cecil B. DeMille. It got pretty gritty. I started to hear the word ""draw"" in my sleep. Then one day, I was just walking down the street when I heard a voice behind me say, ""Reach for it, mister!"" I spun around... and there I was, face to face with a six-year old kid. Well, I just threw my guns down and walked away. Little bastard shot me in the ass. So I limped to the nearest saloon, crawled inside a whiskey bottle... and I've been there ever since.
Uh-oh, Bart. I think Mongo here's taken a liking to you.
Huh-huh, naw, Mongo straight.
Well, Jim, since you are my guest and I am your host, what's your pleasure? What do you like to do?
Oh, I don't know. Play chess... screw...
Well, let's play chess.
What's your name?
Well, my name is Jim, but most people call me... Jim.
I must have killed more men than Cecil B. DeMille.
A man drink like that and he don't eat, he is going to DIE.
When?
Sign here.
Why, Rhett! How many times have I told you to wash up after weekly cross burning?
See, it's coming off.
And now, for my next impression... Jesse Owens.
Qualifications?
Murder... armed robbery... mayhem...
Wait a moment. What have you got in your mouth?
Nuff'm.
""Nuff'm"", eh? Lyle!
Gum!
Chewing gum on line, eh? I hope you brought enough for everybody.
I didn't know there was going to be so many!
Boy, is he strict!
Look at my hand.
Steady as a rock.
Yeah, but I shoot with this one.
Where you headed, cowboy?
Nowhere special.
Nowhere special? I always wanted to go there.
Come on.
I'm rapidly becoming a big underground success in this town.
See? In another twenty-five years, you'll be able to shake their hands in broad daylight.
Now what the hell do you think you're doin' with that tin star, boy?
Watch that ""boy"" shit, redneck. You talkin' to the sheriff of Rock Ridge.
Well, now if that don't beat all. Here we take the good time and trouble to slaughter every last Indian in the West, and for what? So they can appoint a sheriff that's blacker'n any Indian! I am depressed.
Excuse me, Mr. Taggart, sir, but I sure do hate to see you like this. What if me and the boys was to shoot that nigger dead? Would that pep you up some?
That might help.
All right, boys! On the count of three!
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Don't pay no attention to that alkie. He can't even hold a gun, much less shoot it.
Like I said, on the count of three. One... two... three!
Well, don't just sit there lookin' stupid, graspin' your hands in pain. How 'bout a little...
... applause for the Waco Kid?
I don't know what it is.
Sheriff! Mongo's back! He's...
Sheriff! Mongo's back! He's breaking up the whole town! You've got to help us, please!
Did you hear that? Now it's ""please"". This morning, I couldn't get the time of day. Who is this Mongo, anyway?
Well, Mongo ain't exactly a ""who"". He's more of a ""what"".
What he said.
Well, now, I don't know...
Oh, thank you, Sheriff! Oh, thank you very much! Thank you!
The fool's going to... I mean, the sheriff's going to do it!

Checkmate.
What?
Checkmate.

No thanks, food makes me sick.
I'd better sit up.
Need any help?
Oh... all I can get.
Oh deary dear. Look what the cat dragged in.
Hey! Now you've done it!
It was just a scratch Jim, really!
What's going on?
Call a doctor, he skewered Kim!
He didn't skewer me!
You can't touch anything without destroying it! Who the hell do you think you are hanging around here, huh? Get the hell outta here! Go you freak!
He tried to hurt you.
No he did not and you know it!
Are you nuts? I just saw him!
Jim, I don't love you anymore I just want you to go, ok? Just go!
Are you serious? Losing me to a loser like that? He isn't even human!
Just get out of here ok, just go!
Dad, did you see where Edward went?
No, he just waltzed down the street.
Edward, I was so afraid. I thought you were dead.
I didn't.
STOP IT! Or I'll kill you myself!
Bullshit!
Hey, I said stay away from her!
Why can't you do it?
Because my father keeps the damn room locked. We need Edward to get us in.
Well can't you just take the key when he's sleeping or something?
You don't understand. The only thing that guy hangs onto tighter is his dick.
I'd give my left nut to see that again.
Forget about holding her hand, man. Think about the damage he could do to other places.
Hey! Now you've done it.
It's just a scratch, Jim, really. It's okay.
Stay back! Touch her again and I'll kill you.
No, it's no big deal. It's just a scratch.
Call a doctor. He skewered Kim."
Bret Maverick,AG,Fastest Gun In The West,"Oh, you sure do pick the spots.
Yeah, I know. You know the next time you people come and drive us off our land I'm gonna find a nice piece of swamp that's so God-awful, maybe then you'll leave us the hell alone.

After you is ugly Annie Bransford. When she was born, she came out backwards and no one noticed. Hell, when she was little, her parents had to tie a pork chop around her neck so the dog would play with her. When she's making love, she has to pretend SHE'S someone else!
See that hawk? You know what it means?
No. What does it mean?
Nothing. But you didn't know that did you?
Now, it's time for you to do something that I want
How dare you. I am a lady. Not if you were a hundred years old, not if I was a hundred years old...
Oh shut up. I don't want to go to bed with you, lady.
Why not?
Why not? I'd be too frightened. God knows what parts of me you'd steal. I'd wake up with all sorts of things missing.
How'd you know I was bluffing? I didn't do any of my tells. I didn't shuffle my cards, I didn't pull my hair, I didn't even flick my teeth.
You held your breath. If you'd been excited, you would have started breathing harder.
I did not.
Did I?
Did I?
Did I?
Well, I'll just pretend I was playin' with someone else's money.
That shouldn't be too hard.
You did hold your breath, ma'am.
Well look at this. Here's a lot of money and your gun is six feet away.
, :
Eight.
, :
Eight.
What a remarkable family.
How'd she - how'd she figure that?
Well, you all don't have the exclusive on tells! You both have the same height, the same build, you both talk the same, you both kiss the same, you both draw your guns the same, and you both sing the same wrong words to 'Amazing Grace'.
, :
Do not.
, :
Do not.
There isn't a Mrs. Maverick is there?
Oh I'm sure I would have remembered.
I've just noticed something.
What?
You can't help it can you? You are irresistible.
Oh, what the hell! I feel like being silly. I'll call... Uh...
It's just a pair of sixes. If you can beat that you got me licked, and that's not a totally unpleasant prospect.
Well, they're Indians. They probably just stole the ponies!
Not everybody's like you, Mrs. Bransford.
What is it with you and Indians anyway?
Oh, nothing. I try and shoot one a day, if possible, before noon. How 'bout you, Coop? I figure it's their fault for being on our land before we got here.
So, are you gonna miss me?
Are you gonna miss me?
You are gonna miss me.
how do you know that?
I was not... maybe I was.
Lord... whatever I've done to piss you off... if you could just get me out of this and somehow let me know what it was I promise to rectify the situation.
Well, now, I bring all sorts of plusses to the table. I hardly ever bluff and I never ever cheat.
My old pappy always used to say, ""there is no more deeply satisfying religious experience... than cheatin' on a cheater.""
I never said that once. You've been misquoting me all your life.
What, we're going to quibble over fine points?
You never even get close. Give me some credit.
Well, Bret, you know what we ended up with? A half a million dollar silk shirt.
Nope, we ended up with a quarter million dollar silk shirt, because my old pappy always used to say ""Don't put the chicken in front of""... no, wait ""Never cut the cards before""... no, wait, ""Don't put all you eggs in one basket"".
Now that, I said.
I've only got one gun, that's 6 bullets. They're six, that's 36 bullets. Maybe they've got two guns, that's 72 bullets, maybe they've got rifles...
You're babbling.
No I wasn't.
Pa, this man wants to know if you want to buy a burro.
That burro ain't worth a dollar!
Well, sir, I say you got yourself a deal.
Here's your dollar.
Well, he doesn't eat much, but he's a regular jackass, and hee-haw, hee-haw, he hawlways likes to be called Arthur.
What kind of animal are you?
Vulture.
From the moment I slapped eyes on this hombre, I smelled trouble. And re-fried beans. Something else was telling me that this was not just a ""chance"" meeting.
I don't know why I kept the rest of the money in the satchel, though.
I do.
So do I. Sure will be a whole lot of fun getting it back.
A shouldn't be doin' this.
You're just standing in the hallway, Mrs. Bransford, I think that's still legal in this state.
You tend to breathe hard when you get excited.
How did you - oh.
No, no. I'm the driver.
Oh. Are you all right?
Why does everybody always ask me that?"
Ned Nederlander,AG,Fastest Gun In The West,"Reading telegram: ""Three Amigos, Hollywood, California. You are very great. 100,000 pesos. Come to Santa Poco put on show, stop. The In-famous El Guapo.""
What does that mean, in-famous?
Oh, Dusty. In-famous is when you're MORE than famous. This man El Guapo, he's not just famous, he's IN-famous.
100,000 pesos to perform with this El Guapo, who's probably the biggest actor to come out of Mexico!
Wow, in-famous? In-famous?
Oh, great. You killed the invisible swordsman!
He's dead, all right.
How was I supposed to know where he was?
You were supposed to fire up. *We* both fired *up*.
It's like living with a six-year old.

Yes, they are going... to kill us.
What am I doing in Mexico.
I've been shot already.
I know.
What are we gonna do?
We're not gonna get PAID, that's for sure.
One time, Dorothy Gish was visiting me on the set of ""Little Neddy, Grab Your Gun"". And she came up to me and she looked me in the face and - I'd never met her, I'd just known her on films, you know, Dorothy Gish, Lillian's sister - and she looked me in the eyes and she said, ""Young man, you have got it."" And. Ah! Dorothy Gish. It's a true story.
Hey, Lucky, what are you gonna do with your share of the money?
A car. A big, shiny silver car. I'll drive all over Hollywood. Show Flugleman a thing or two. What about you?
New York. Maybe Paris. Champagne. Parties. I'll be a big shot for a while.
Yeah.
How about you, Ned?
I'm gonna start a foundation to help homeless children.
That occurred to me to do that at one point, too.
Well, I meant that I would do that first, and then I would get a big shiny car.
What are we even doing in Mexico?
We're not getting paid that's for sure!"
Harmonica,"BF, AG","Revenge, Fastest Gun In The West","And Frank?
Frank sent us.
Did you bring a horse for me?
Well... looks like we're...
...looks like we're shy one horse.
You brought two too many.
The reward for this man is 5000 dollars, is that right?
Judas was content for 4970 dollars less.
There were no dollars in them days.
But sons of bitches... yeah.
Listen, Harmonica, a town built around a railroad - mm mm mm mmm - you could make a fortune, huh? Hundreds of thousands of dollars. Hey, more than that. Thousands of thousands.
They call them ""millions.""
""Millions."" Hm.
I saw three of these dusters a short time ago. They were waiting for a train. Inside the dusters, there were three men.
So?
Inside the men, there were three bullets.
That's a crazy story, Harmonica, for two reasons: One, nobody around these parts got the guts to wear those dusters except Cheyenne's men. Two, Cheyenne's men don't get killed. That surprise you?
Yeah. Well, you know music, and you can count - all the way up to two.
All the way up to six if I have to...
... and maybe faster than you.
Morton once told me I could never be like him. Now I understand why. Wouldn't have bothered him, knowing you were around somewhere alive.
So, you found out you're not a businessman after all.
Just a man.
An ancient race. Other Mortons'll be along, and they'll kill it off.
The future don't matter to us. Nothing matters now - not the land, not the money, not the woman. I came here to see you, 'cause I know that now you'll tell me what you're after.
Only at the point of dyin'.
What do you want? Who are ya?
Dave Jenkins.
Dave Jenkins is dead a long time ago.
Calder Benson.
What's your name? Benson's dead, too.
You ought to know, Frank, better than anyone. You killed 'em.
Who are you?
Jim Cooper, Chuck Youngblood.
More dead men.
They were all alive until they met you, Frank.
Your friends have a high mortality rate, Frank. First three, then two.
So, YOU'RE the one who makes appointments.
And you're the one who doesn't keep 'em.
But... but they were his men.
Yeah.
And they tried to kill him.
They must've found somebody who pays better.
And YOU! You saved his life.
I didn't let them kill him, and that's not the same thing.
When you hear a strange sound, drop to the ground.
Time sure flies. It's already past twelve.
Now I gotta go. Gonna be a beautiful town, Sweetwater.
I hope you'll come back someday.
Someday.
Surprised to see me here?
I knew you'd come.
Hey, what in the hell are you standing around for?
Well, gee, what are we supposed to do?
What are you supposed to do? Build a station! Idiots!
I figure it ain't gonna look like much, but it'll be the first thing she sees, when she gets back.
If she gets back.
I could swear we're going to have that strange sound.
Right now.
He not only plays. He can shoot too.
Do you only know how to shoot? Or do you know how to cut too?
What the hell is this?
Can't you see?
It's a station. And all around it a town. Brett McBain's town.
Was HE crazy, heh!
Yeah in a very special way. An Irishman.
He knew sooner or later that railroad coming through Flagstone would continue on west, so he looked over all this county out here until he found this hunk of desert. Nobody wanted it, but he bought it.
Then he tightened his belt, and for years he waited.
Waited for what?
For the railroad to reach this point.
Ah, but how in the hell could he be sure the railroad would pass through his property?
Them steam engines can't roll without water, and the only water for fifty miles west of Flagstone is right here, under this land.
Ah-ha! He was no fool, our dead friend, huh?
He was going to sell this piece of desert for his weight in gold, wasn't he?
You don't sell the dream of a lifetime. Brett McBain wanted his station. He got the rights to build it.
How do you know all this?
I saw a document. It was all in order - seals, signatures, everything. One thing though, in very small print, there is a short clause which says that McBain or his heirs lose all rights if, by the time the railroad reaches this point, the station ain't built yet.
You know, Wobbles... I'm kind of mad at you.
Pick any method you like, just make the deal.
Which deal, Frank? We have more than one, you and me.
And Frank?
Frank sent us.

Sheriff Woody,AG,Fastest Gun In The West,"All right, that's enough! Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy.
Toy?
T-O-Y, Toy!
Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is ""Space Ranger"".
The word I'm searching for - I can't say, because there's preschool toys present.
What happened to you?
One minute you're defending the whole galaxy, and, suddenly, you find yourself sucking down darjeeling with Marie Antoinette... and her little sister.
And according to my navi-computer, the...
SHUT UP! Just shut up, you idiot!
Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
This is a perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're gonna move to their new house in two days, and it's all your fault!
My fault? If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place...
Oh, yeah? Well, if *you* hadn't shown up with your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me...
Don't talk to me about importance! Because of *you*, the future of this entire universe is in jeopardy!
What? What are you talkin' about?
Right now, poised at the edge of the galaxy, Emperor Zurg has been secretly building a weapon with the destructive capacity to annihilate an entire planet! I alone have information that reveals this weapon's only weakness. And *you*, my friend, are responsible for delaying my rendezvous with Star Command!
YOU - ARE - A... *TOY*! You aren't the real Buzz Lightyear! You're a... aw, you're - you're an action figure!
You are a child's play thing!
You are a sad, strange little man, and you have my pity.
Farewell.
Oh, yeah? Well, good riddance, ya loony!
Rendezvous with Star Command.
Reach for the sky!
Huh?
This town ain't big enough for the two of us!
What?
Somebody's poisoned the waterhole!
It's busted.
Who are you calling busted, Buster?
Huh?
That's right! I'm talking to you, Sid Philips! We don't like being blown up, Sid. Or smashed, or torn apart.
W-we?
That's right, your toys!
From now on, you must take good care of your toys, because if you don't, we'll find out, Sid!
We toys can see EVERYTHING!
So play nice!
Hey, who's got my hat?
Look, I'm Woody! Howdy, howdy, howdy!
Ha-ha, ha-ha...
Gimme that!
Hey, Buzz! You're flying!
This isn't flying, this is falling with style!
To infinity and beyond!
Mr. Lightyear, now I'm curious... what does a space ranger actually do?
He's not a space ran-*ger*! He doesn't fight evil or, or... shoot lasers or fly.
Excuse me.

Wow. Impressive wingspan. Very good.
Oh, what? What? These are plastic. He can't fly.
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy, and I *can* fly.
No, you can't.
Yes, I can.
Can't.
Can.
Can't, can't, ca-an't!
I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
Okay, Mr. Lightbeer, prove it.
All right then, I will.
Hey, a laser! How come *you* don't have a laser, Woody?
It's not a laser! It's a...
It's a little light bulb that blinks.
What's with him?
Laser envy.
Psst! Hey Buzz!
Hey! Get over here and see if you can get this toolbox off me!
Oh, come on Buzz. I can't do this without you. I need your help.
I can't help. I can't help anyone.
Why sure you can Buzz. You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's House.
Andy's house. Sid's house. What's the difference?
Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly!
No, Woody. For the first time, I am thinking clearly. You were right all along. I'm not a Space Ranger. I'm just a toy. A stupid, little, insignificant toy.
Wait a minute. Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
Yeah, right.
Not, it is!
Look, over there in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a toy. You are his toy!
But why would Andy want me?
Why would Andy want you? Look at you! You're a Buzz Lightyear! Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you. You've got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that... that whoosh thing. You're a Cool Toy. As a matter of fact, you're too cool. I mean - what chance does a toy like me have against a Buzz Lightyear action figure. All I can do is this.
There's a Snake in my Boot!
Why would Andy ever wanna play me me, when he's got you? I'm the one that should be strapped to that rocket.
What's going on?
Nothing that concerns you space man, just us toys.
I'd better have a look anyway.
Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
That's why. Sid.
Sure is a hairy fella...
No, no, that's Scud, you idiot. *That* is Sid.
You mean that happy child?
That ain't no happy child!
He tortures toys - just for fun!
Oh Buzz! Buzz Lightyear! Thank Goodness! We've Got Trouble!
Trouble? Trouble where?
Down there. A helpless toy is trapped, Buzz!
On it!
I don't see anything!
Oh he's there, just keep looking.

BUZZ!

BUZZ!
Buzz!
I don't see him in the driveway. I think he bounced into Sid's Yard.
All right, everyone! This... is a stick-up. Don't anybody move! Now empty that safe!
Ooh, hoo hoo! Money, money, money!
Stop it! Stop it, you mean old potato!
Quiet, Bo Peep! Or your sheep get run over!
Help! Baaa! Help us!
Oh no! Not my sheep! Somebody do something!
Reach for the sky!
Oh no! Sheriff Woody!
I'm here to stop you, One-eyed Bart!
D'oh! How'd you know it was me?
Are you gonna come quietly?
Ya can't touch me, Sheriff! I brought my Attack Dog,
with a built-in force field!
Well, I brought my dinosaur!
Who eats force field dogs!
Arr rawr rawr! Yipe, yipe-yipe-yipe!
You're going to jail, Bart. Say goodbye to the wife and tater tots.
You saved the day again, Woody!
You're my favorite deputy!
I've set my laser from stun to kill.
Oh, great. If anyone attacks we can blink em' to death.
This is an intergalactic emergency. I need to commandeer your vessel to Sector 12. Who's in charge here?
The clawwwwwwwww!
The claw is our master.
The claw chooses who will go and who will stay.
This is ludicrous.
Hey, Etch... Draw!
D'oh! Got me again! Etch, you've been working on that draw. Fastest knobs in the west.
I think you've had enough tea for today. Let's get you out of here Buzz...
Don't you get it?
You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbitt!
Snap out of it, Buzz!
I-I-I... you're right. I'm sorry, I am just a little depressed, that's all. I can get through this.
Oh, I'm a sham!
Son of a building block!It's Woody!
He's in the psycho's bedroom!
Woody?
Boy, am I glad to see you guys!
I knew you'd come back!
What are you doing over there?
It's a long story, I'll explain later. Here! Catch this!
I got it!
Good going Slink! Now tie it onto something!
Wait, I have a better idea! How about we don't?
Hey!
Potato Head!
Did you all take those Stupid Pills this morning? Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz?
And now you wanna let him back over here?
No, no. You got it all wrong Potato Head. Buzz is right here. He's with me.
Buzz, come over here and tell the nice toy's that you're not dead!
Just a sec.
Buzz, will you get up here and gimme a hand?
Ha-ha, ha-ha. That's real funny. THIS IS SERIOUS!
How am I gonna convince those guys it was an accident?
Buzz!
Buzz! You're alive! This is great! I'm saved! Andy will find you here, he'll take us back to the room, and then you can tell everyone that this was all this all just a Big Mistake. Huh?
Right? Buddy?
I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
Oh. Well, that's good.
But we're not on my planet, are we?
No. Daaaah-oof!
Okay, come on. You want a piece of me?
Ow!
Buzz, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear to the Rescue.
Next stop...
Pizza Planet! Yeah!
Andy!
He doesn't realise I'm not there?
I'm lost! I'm a lost toy!
Terrain seems a bit unstable. No readout yet if the air is breathable. And there seems to be no sign of intelligent life anywhere...
Hello-o-o!
HO-YAH!
Hey hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Did I frighten you? Didn't mean to. Sorry. Howdy. My name... is Woody... and this... is Andy's room. That's all I wanted to say. And also, there has been a bit of a mix-up. This is my spot, see... the bed here.
Local law enforcement! It's about time you got here. I'm Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger, Universe Protection Unit. My ship has crash-landed here by mistake.
Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed here is my spot.
I need to repair my turbo boosters. Are you still using fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystallic fusion?
Well, let's see, we got double-A's.
Listen, Lightsnack. You stay away from Andy. He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
What are you talking about? Where's that bonding strip?
And another thing, *stop* with this *spaceman* thing! It's getting on my nerves.
Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command?
Oh-ho! O-okay, ooh, well, so you wanna do it the hard way, huh?
Don't even think about it, cowboy.
Oh yeah, tough guy?
The air isn't toxic?
How dare you open a space man's helmet on an uncharted planet! My eyeballs could've been sucked from their sockets!
Hey guys, RC's trying to tell us something.
What is it Boy?

He says that this is *no* accident!
What do you mean?
I mean Humpty Dumpty was pushed, by Woody!
Wait a minute, You don't think I even meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you? Potato Head?
That's Mr. Potato Head to *you* you Backstabbing murderer!
Now, guys, it was an accident. C'mon, you-you've gotta believe me.
We believe ya, Woody. Right, Rex?
Well, I mean, uh, I don't like confrontations!
Couldn't handle Buzz cutting on your playtime, could you Woody? Didn't wanna face the fact that Buzz might be Andy's *new* favourite toy. So you got rid of him. Well what if Andy starts playing with *me* more Woody, huh? You gonna knock me out the window too?
I don't think we should give him the chance.
You actually think you're THE Buzz Lightyear? Oh, all this time I thought it was an act!
Hey, guys, look! It's the *real* Buzz Lightyear!
You're mocking me, aren't you?
Oh no, no no no, no...
BUZZ, LOOK! AN ALIEN!
Where?
Hey! Who moved my doodle pad way over here?
ROAR!
Hey, how ya doin', Rex.
Were you scared? Tell me honestly.
I was close to being scared that time.
I'm going for fearsome here, but I just don't feel it! I'm think I'm just coming off as annoying.
Buzz? Buzz Lightyear? You're not worried, are you?
Me? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Are you?
Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?
Oh, oh, what is it? What is it? Wow, a puppy!
, :
Heh, heh!
, :
Heh, heh!
Wind the frog!
Tuesday night's plastic corrosion awareness meeting, was I think, a big success. We'd like to thank Mr. Spell for putting that on for us. Thank you Mr. Spell.
You're. Welcome.
Listen Buzz, forget about me. You should get outta here while you can.
Buzz! What are you doing? I thought you were...
Come on, Sheriff. There's a kid in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
Woody! It's the Moving Van!
We've gotta get out of here, now!
Buzz! Hey, I'm out!
Almost there!
Woody! Are you alright?
I'm fine... I'm OK.
Oh yeah! Time for lift off!
Sheriff, I can see your indwelling from here. You're almost home.
Nirvana is coming, the mystic portal awaits.
Will you be quiet? You guys don't get it, do you? Once we go into Sid's house, we won't be coming out!
AAAAAH! This is the part where we blow up!
Not today.
Gaddily bob-howdy!
Oh, shut up.
Buzz! Go away, you disgusting freaks!
All back! Back, you cannibals!
He's still alive and you're not getting him, you monsters.
Hey, they fixed you? But... but they're cannibals, we saw them eat other toys.
Uh, sorry. We thought you're gonna... you know... eat my friend.
No, no, no, no, wait. What's wrong?
Sid?
Not right now, Mom. I'm busy!
Sid! Buzz, get up! Use our legs! Fine, let Sid trash but don't blame me!
Hey uh, Slinky?
Right here, Woody. I'm red this time.
No, Slink...
All right, you can be red if you want.
Not now, Slink. I've got some bad news.
Bad news?
Shhh!
Gather everyone for a staff meeting and be happy.
Got it.
Be happy!

Uh, Buzz, we missed the truck!
We're not aiming for the truck!
Al lright, all right! If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
Yes, yes! We promise!
Okay! Save your batteries.
Woody? Where'd you go?
He's lying, Buzz ain't there.
Oh hi Buzz. Why don't you say hello to the guys over there.
Oh hi, how you doing?
You guys won't believe this, but Buzz and I are friends now.
You bet. To infinity and beyond!
Gimme five!
Hey look, it is Buzz!
I knew you were right all along Woody! I never doubted you for a second.
Now gimme back the lights so we can help the two over here.
Pull my string! The birthday party's today? Okay everybody, the coast is clear!
It's a...
It's A WHAT? WHAT IS IIIITTTTT?
Oh, no!
Oh, ya big lizard! Now we'll never know what it is!
Way to go, Rex!
No, no, turn 'em around! Turn 'em around!
He's putting them in backward!
Hey, you're putting 'em in backwards!
PLUS IS POSITIVE! MINUS IS NEGATIVE! Oh, let me!
Red alert! Red alert! Andy is coming upstairs!
...juvenile intrusion, repeat! Assume your positions now!
ANDY'S COMING! Everybody back to your places! Hurry!
Where's my ear? Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear?
Can!
Whoooa! Oh wow, you flew magnificently!
I've found my moving buddy!
Thank... th-thank you all, thank you!
That wasn't flying! That was... falling with style!
Great!
Woody! The Rocket!
The Match! Yes! Thankyou, Sid!
No! No, no, no, no, noooooo!
What are you doing?
Hold still Buzz!
You did it! Next stop, Andy!
Wait a minute. I just lit a Rocket. Rockets explode!
It's a special spaceship, I just saw it.
You mean it has hyperdrive?
Hyperactive hyperdrive, and astro... uh... turf.
What would you say if I get someone else to watch the sheep for me tonight?
Oh-ho yeah. Thought so.
Do you know these life forms?
Yes, they're Andy's toys.
Has everybody picked a moving buddy?
Moving buddy? You can't be serious!
I didn't know we were supposed to have one already!
Do we have to hold hands?
""Rendezvous with Star Command.""
Pizza Planet?
Andy! Oh, no! I can't show my face in that room without Buzz.
Buzz! Buzz, come back!
Go away!
No! Buzz, you gotta come back! I...
I found a spaceship!
It's a spaceship, Buzz!
Now, you're sure this space freighter will return to its point of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
Uh-huh. And when we get there, we'll find a way to transport you home.
Well, then, let's climb aboard.
No, no, no, wait, Buzz! Buzz! Let's get in the back. No one will see us there.
Negative. There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area. We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
Yeah, bu... Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!
It's safer in the cockpit than the cargo bay. What an idiot.
Will Andy pick me?
'Don't count on it'? Awwww! Arrrgh!
Sergeant, establish a recon post downstairs. Code Red. You know what to do.
Yes, sir!
All right, men, you heard him! Code Red, repeat: we're at Code Red! Recon plan Charlie: Execute! Let's move, move, move, move, move!
Wait just a minute here. What are you trying to pull?
Nothing!
That is Disgusting!
*Murderer*
No, no no no. It's not what you think. I swear!
Save it for the jury!
I hope Sid pulls your voice box out, ya creep!
Don't leave! You've gotta help us please!You don't know what's it's like over here!
Slink, please! Please listen to me1 Slink, don't...
SLI-I-I-I-NKYYY!
A Buzz Lightyear? No way.
Yes!
HEY!
He has been chosen.
Stop it! Stop it!
Alright, Double Prizes!
Let's go home and play."
Ben Wade,AG,Fastest Gun In The West,"I ain't stubborn.
Excuse me?
You said I was stubborn, for keeping my family on a dying ranch. It's my son, Mark. The young one. He got tuberculosis when he was two. Doctor said he would die if he didn't have a dry climate, so...
Why are you tellin' me this?
I don't know. I guess I just... wanted you to know that I ain't stubborn, is all.
You ever read the bible, Dan? I read it one time. I was eight years old. My daddy just got hisself killed over a shot of whiskey and my mama said ""we're going back East to start over"". So she gave me a bible, sat me down in the train station, told me to read it. She was gonna get our tickets. Well, I did what she said. I read that bible from cover to cover. It took me three days. She never came back.
You know, squeezin' that watch won't stop time.
What did Doc Potter give his life for, William? McElroy...
Little red ants on a hill.
I'll pay you the 200, Dan. Right now. And you can walk away.
You know, this whole ride... it's been egging on me. That's what the government gave me for my leg - 198 dollars 36 cents and the funny thing is that... when you think about it, which I have been lately, is they weren't paying me to walk away, they were paying me so they could walk away.
Don't muddy the past in the present, Dan.
No... Wade, I'm seeing the world the way it is.
So, boys - where we headed?
Taking you to the 3:10 to Yuma day after tomorrow.
Shouldn't have told him that.
Relax, friend. Now if we get separated, I'll know where to meet up.
I've always liked you Byron, but you never know when to shut up. Even bad men love their mommas.
They're gonna kill you and your father, William. They're gonna laugh while they do it. I think you know that.
Call 'em off.
Why should I?
Because you're not all bad.
Yes, I am.
You saved us from those Indians.
I saved myself.
You got us through the tunnels. You helped us get away.
If I had a gun in them tunnels, I would have used it on you.
I don't believe you.
Kid, I wouldn't last five minutes leading an outfit like that if I wasn't as rotten as hell.
Here's to the four we lost in battle. And here's to the boss, who had to say goodbye to Tommy Darden today. And that's too bad.
Proverbs 13:3. ""He that keepeth his mouth, keepeth his life. He that opens his lips too wide shall bring on his own destruction"".
Amen.
Tommy was weak. Tommy was stupid. Tommy is dead.
I'd drink to that.
Twenty-two robberies. Over four hundred thousand dollars in losses. More in delays. The Southern Pacific will have Ben Wade convicted in a federal court. Hanged in public. An example made. And we will pay to make it happen.
Y'all notice he didn't mention any of the lives I've taken.
Woman'll do things to ya, you'll never forget.
They give you disease you'll never forget.
Remind me never to play poker in this town.
Is it true that you dynamited a wagon full of prospectors in the western territories last spring?
No, that's a lie... It was a train full.
Well, you did it, Dan.
You say one more word, and I'll cut you down right here.
I like this side of you, Dan.
If you're gonna kill me, just as soon get to it.
I ain't gonna kill you. Not like this.
Won't change a thing, lettin' me live. I'll come for you.
I'd be disappointed if you didn't.
Be careful with that thing. That gun's got a curse on it.
Laugh while you can.
Now, you see Dan, generally pretty much everyone wants to live. That means Butterfield, too. He's gonna walk out on you. He's gonna come back up here, and he's gonna walk out on you. Now, what you gotta figure is why you and your boy are gonna die. Because Butterfield's railroad lost some money?
So this is the bridal suite? Now, I wonder how many brides have taken in this view?
Just you left, Dan. Just you and your boy.
Byron, what an unpleasant surprise.
Have you ever read a book in your life, Byron, except the bible?
No need.
Well then!
I gotta take a piss.
You ever been to San Francisco?
If it's all right by you Mr Wade, I'd rather we not talk
So you never been to San Francisco?
No
I knew a girl there. She was the daughter of a Sea-Captain. She had the most beautiful green eyes. About the greenest eyes I ever saw. Like yours. And I'd stare deep into them and they'd just change color infront of me. All the colors of the sea. What'd you say your name was again?
Alice?
What time is it?
About ten past three.
Where's the 3:10 to Yuma?
Running late, I suppose.
Goddamn trains. Never can rely on 'em, huh?
Well, would you look at all this? You all spared no expense this time, Byron. I gotta say, though, it's probably cheaper just to let me rob the damn thing.
They're going to kill me in the morning... I'll never see the sun.
Well, Tommy, it seems that there was a Pinkerton inside that coach that wasn't quite dead yet. Now, I know Charlie told you, because we done got but a few rules in this outfit. And this is what happens when you put us all at risk.
You ever worked for a one-eyed Irishman in Leadville?"
RoboCop,AG,Fastest Gun In The West,"Dead or alive, you're coming with me!
Dick, you're *fired*!
Thank you.
What are your Prime Directives?
Serve the public trust, protect the innocent, uphold the law.
Nice shootin', son. What's your name?
Murphy.
Robo, excuse me, Robo. Any special message for all the kids watching at home?
Stay out of trouble.
Clarence Boddicker, you are under arrest. You have the right to remain silent.
Fuck you.
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute! I'm protected, man. I've got protection.
You have the right to an attorney.
What is this shiiiit.
Goddammit! Godammit! Listen to me! Listen to me, you fuck! There's another guy. He's, uh, he's OCP. He's a senior president.
Anything you say may be used against you.
It's Dick Jonessssss...
Don't you get it? You cocksucker! I work for Dick Jones! Dick Jones! He's the Number Two Guy at OCP. OCP runs the cops.
You're a cop. Cop!
Yes, I am a cop.
Come quietly or there will be... trouble.
Oh...
Fuck you!
Let's talk.
Murphy had a wife and son. What happened to them?
Well, after the funeral... she moved away.
Where did they go?
She thought you were dead. She started over again.
I can feel them... but I can't remember them.
Leave me alone.
Drop it!
Dead or alive, you're coming with me.
I know you. You're dead! We killed you!
We killed you!
Okay. I give up.
I'm not arresting you anymore.
H-hey, now wait a second. Now, wait a minute. You're taking this kind of personal, aren't ya? Come on, man. Come on, now. You're making me nervous. Come on, you can't do this! Come on, now! Don't mess around! Hey! Hey! Come on, man. Now, don't get cute!
Let the woman go. You are under arrest.
Shit!
You... you better back-up, pal! 'Cuz... he's gonna kill her. He... he is gonna kill her!
I'm gonna cut this bitch!
He's gonna kill her, man!
I'm gonna cut this bitch!
He... he's gonna kill her!
Oooow! Ooow-how-ha-how! Ahhhh!
Your move, Creep.
Oooow! Ooow! Ooooow!
Okay, okay, it's okay!
Oh, God. I was so scared. Thank you. Oh, thank you.
Madam, you have suffered an emotional shock. I will notify a rape crisis center.
Lewis! Lewis!
Murphy... I'm a mess...
They'll fix you. They fix everything.
Excuse me. I have to go. Somewhere there is a crime happening.
Book him!
What's the charge?
He's a cop killer.
Looking for me?
Come in, officer. You know, I usually don't see anyone without an appointment, but your case I'll make an exception.
You are under arrest.
Oh? On what charge?
Aiding and abetting a known felon.
Sounds like I'm in a lot of trouble. You better take me in.
I will.
What's the matter officer? I'll tell you what's the matter. It's a little insurance policy called ""Directive 4"", my little contribution to your psychological profile. Any attempt to arrest a senior officer of OCP results in shutdown. What did you think? That you were an ordinary police officer? You're our product, and we can't very well have our products turning against us, can we?
Ahh, still a little fight left in you. Maybe you'd like to meet a friend of mine.
I had to kill Bob Morton because he made a mistake. Now it's time to erase that mistake.
How can we help you, officer?
Dick Jones is wanted for murder.
This is absurd! That thing... is a violent mechanical psychopath!
My program will not allow me to act against an officer of this company.
These are serious charges. What is your evidence?
I had to kill Bob Morton because he made a mistake. Now it's time to erase that mistake. I had to kill Bob Morton because he made a mistake. Now it's time to erase that mistake.
Get up! Get up! I want a chopper, now! We will walk to the roof very calmly, I will board the chopper with my hostage. Anybody tries to stop me... the old geezer gets it.
Dick, you're fired!
Thank you.
Drop the gun, you are under arrest!
Fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me!


Thank you for your cooperation, goodnight.
Would there be anything else, sir?
Yeah, empty the register and put the money in the bag.
Excuse me?
I said give me your money and all of it, and don't fuck with me!
Now move! Open the safe, pops. Open the god-damn safe!
We-we don't have a safe.
Shit!
There's your god-damn safe! Open that son of a bitch! I'm gonna count to three and you'd better open that son of a bitch! Come on, come ON!
I'm gonna blow her brains out.
I'll open the safe.
Good boy.
Come on! Well, you better open that on the count of three. One. Two.
Fuck me!
Drop the gun. You are under arrest.
Fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me!
Thank you for your co-operation. Good night.
I'll buy that for a dollar!
Robocop: Who is he? What is he? Where does he come from? He is OCP""s newest soldier in their revolutionary crime management program. OCP spokesmen claim that the fearless machine has crooks on the run in Old Detroit. Today, kids at Lee Iacocca Elementary School got to meet in person what their parents only read about in comic books.

Mia Thermopolis,AT,Klutz,"Why me?
Because you saw me when I was invisible.
This is between a waltz and a tango.
It's a wango?
I can't be a princess! I'm still waiting for normal body parts to arrive!
Hey Joe? Can we park a block away from school? I really don't want to cause a riot with this hearse.
This is a non-riot hearse. And if it were a hearse there would be silence in the backseat.
You are princess of Genovia.
Me, a princess?
Shut up!
I beg your pardon, ""Shut up""?
Oh, your majesty, in America, it doesn't always mean to be quiet. Here it could mean ""Wow, gee whiz, golly wolly""...
I can't do this, I'm a girl.
What am I? A duck?
Do you wear contact lenses?
Oh, I have them, but I don't really like to wear them that much.

You broke my brush.

Thank you. And you look so...
... clean.
Michael, don't always think you could get a ride with us and...
Oy. Who destroyed you?

You look ridiculous. You should sue.
Well um... I know it's a little straighter and shorter and...
Weirder!
An attractive weirder.
No, it's not attractive!
Seat belts, please.
What I really can't understand is that you ditched me again yesterday when I really needed your help at the greenpeace petition.
These bags! You HAVE one of these bags? You know, we could hock that and feed a whole third world country!
Am I right?
No.
If there are no more passengers, I think we should close the door.
Joseph, can we eighty-six the flags please?
No. The flags allow me to park anywhere. We keep the flags.
Sorry, Joseph.
You can call me, ""Joe"".
""Joey""?
No. Joe.
You'll never guess what Josh Bryant just asked me!
""Can I borrow a comb""?
Is this punishment for driving without a licensed driver in the front seat?
I am invisible, and I am wet.
Okay... you know what? I don't feel protected. You try living for 15 years thinking that you're one person, and then in five minutes, you find out you're a princess. Just in case I wasn't enough of a freak already, let's add a tiara!
As always, this is as good as it's going to get.
You know, most kids hope for a car for their 16th birthday, not a country!
Mia, the-the three of us have to talk.
Oh, OK. Um, is there maybe something else about me and my life that just maybe I might want to know about? Um-oh no, are you two waiting to take me on a talk show somewhere and to let me know I have a twin sister who's a duchess?
You have a cousin who's a contessa. Fondly known as Bartholomew. Actually, we call him Pookie.
Tell me, how does my mother, or any person for that matter, go into a parent/teacher conference and come out with a date?
Dear Diary, today is my first official day as Princess of Genovia. We'll land in a few hours, and I'll meet Parliament and the people before beginning my royal duties. Mom is, of course, moving to Genovia with me, and we'll continue painting - without the balloons. Lilly and Michael are planning to spend their summer vacation at our - can you believe it - palace. They're even having my Mustang brought over, which I can legally drive in two weeks. Grandma's so glad to be going home, and Joseph - well, he's watching nearby as usual. Everybody's got pre-coronation jitters, including me. Everybody that is, except Fat Louie. He's totally adapted to being a royal. I guess he was one all along.
Princess, look out the window... and welcome to Genovia.
Hey, Joe?
Mm-Hmmm?
I'm gonna turn the backseat into a dressing room so I can change into a proper outfit for Madame, OK?
OK. And don't forget your shoes.
Ahh, thanks.
Strange town, San Francisco. When I purchased the pumps, they asked if I wanted them wrapped or if I was going to wear them.
Okay I look like an asparagus.
But a very, very cute asparagus!
This is getting us nowhere! Talk to me!
I can't talk to you right now; I'm late for a meeting with my guidance counselor.
I'm late for a meeting with Spain and *Portugal*!
So, where are you taking me?
Well, uh, do you have any change?
No. It's not appropriate for royalty to jingle.
Okay, I'll get the change.
Somebody sat on me again.
Lilly! Just stop it, okay? Just because your hair sucks, get off mine!
And then I realized how many stupid times a day I used the word ""I"". In fact, probably all I ever do is think about myself. And how lame is that when there's, like, 7 billion other people out there on the planet and when -
You are so lucky you don't know who your parents are.
Now, what did you want to tell me?
Something that, I think, will have a very big impact upon your life.
I already have braces.
No, it's bigger than orthodontia.
I don't want to rule my own country, I just want to pass the tenth grade.
Where are you going?
I'm going up to straighten the royal bedchamber.
That Backstreet Boy clone you've had a crush on for years?
He's not a Backstreet Boy clone.

Yes, Mom, I'll go to the dentist after school.
I hate it when they move in like that.

Me and the guys at the home office have been following this plant of yours. We've come up with one incredible idea. We're very proud of it. Picture this: we take leaf cuttings, develop little Audrey IIs and sell them to florist shops across the nation. Pretty soon every household in America could have one.
Every household in America!
For starters, kid. Why, this thing could go... worldwide!
, :

*Worldwide*?
, :

*Worldwide*?
With the right advertising, this thing could be bigger than Hula-Hoops.
Bigger than Hula-Hoops?
The guy sure looks like plant food to me.
All I ever wanted was you and a sweet little house.
Oh Audrey, you're the most wondeful person that ever lived. We're gonna get that little house and everything's gonna be alright, you'll see.
Seymour, what's going on?
Very little, Mr. Mushnik.
Whaddya say, Seymour? Do we have a deal?
No! Keep your contract. Nobody's touchin' that plant, you hear?
Hey, we're offerin' a lotta money here!
Forget the money. Take the money and leave!
Whaddya, nuts?
Yeah, I'm nuts! Get outta here!
Hey, now, come on!
Go on! Get outta here!
You're a loon!
Go on and get out!
Look, I'll come back when you're in a better mood!
Go on, get outta here now!
Alright!
Look Seymour, this could happen to you. Unless I take immediate action.
What's that?
A drill.
It's rusty!
It's an antique. They don't make 'em like this any more. Sturdy. Heavy. Dull!
I'm gonna want some gas fer this.
Oh, thank God. I thought you weren't gonna use any.
Oh, the gas isn't for you Seymour, it's for me. You see, I wanna really enjoy this.
Feed me.
Under NO circumstances.
FEED me.
I will not, so stop asking.
Feed me!
No! No more! I can't keep living with the guilt
Tough titty.
You watch your language.
Ooooh, cut the crap! Bring on the meat!
Tough titty!
You watch your language!
Aw cut the crap and bring on the meat!
Huh? What the hell's that? A gun?
Kid's got a goddamn revolver Oh, Jesus! I'm in trouble now, huh?
Oh, wait till I turn this gas off.
Uh-oh! Oh, give me a hand, would you? No, I guess you wouldn't, would you?
You see, Seymour, I could asphyx...
I could asphyx...
What'd I ever do to you?
Nothing. It's what you did to her.
Her who?
Oh... her...
Little red dots all over the linoleum, little red spots on the concrete outside - I'm talking blood, Krelborn! I'm talking under my own roof!
An axe murderer!
He's got your number now.
I saw everything!
He knows just what you've done.
Everything you did to her boyfriend!
You've got no place to hide.
I saw you chopping him!
You've got nowhere to run.
It's true! I chopped him up, but I didn't kill him!
He knows your life of crime.
Tell it to the police!
I think it's suppertime!
You okay?
Yes... no...
Don't die, Audrey! Please don't die!
You know, the plant just said the strangest thing just now. It said Orin and Mr. Mushnik are already inside!
It's true. I did it. I fed them to it.
And that's what made it so big and strong, and you so famous?
I've done terrible things, Audrey, but not to you. Never to you.
But... I want you to, Seymour.
What?
When I die, which should be very shortly, give me to the plant, so that it will live and bring you all the wonderful things you deserve.
You don't know what you're saying.
But I do! It's the one gift I can give you. And if I'm in the plant, then I am part of the plant, so in a way... we'll always be together.

You remember that total eclipse of the sun about a week ago?
, , :

Da-doo!
, , :

Da-doo!
, , :

Da-doo!
I was walkin' in the wholesale flower district that day...
, , :
Shoop da-doo.
, , :
Shoop da-doo.
, , :
Shoop da-doo.
And I passed by this place, where this old Chinese man...
, , :
Chang, da-doo.
, , :
Chang, da-doo.
, , :
Chang, da-doo.
He sometimes sells me weird and exotic cuttings...
, , :
Snip, da-doo.
, , :
Snip, da-doo.
, , :
Snip, da-doo.
'Cause he knows, you see, that strange plants are my hobby.
, , :
Da da da da da da-doo.
, , :
Da da da da da da-doo.
, , :
Da da da da da da-doo.
He didn't have anything unusual there that day.
, , :
Nope, da-doo.
, , :
Nope, da-doo.
, , :
Nope, da-doo.
So, I was just about to, you know, walk on by...
Good for you.
, , , :
, , , :
, , , :
, , , :
When suddenly, and without warning, there was this...
, , :
...total eclipse of the sun!
, , :
...total eclipse of the sun!
, , :
...total eclipse of the sun!
It got very dark, and there was this strange humming sound, like something from another world.
, , :
Da-doo!
, , :
Da-doo!
, , :
Da-doo!
And when the light came back, this weird plant was just sitting there...
, , :
Whoop, see-doo.
, , :
Whoop, see-doo.
, , :
Whoop, see-doo.
Just, you know, stuck in, among the zinnias.
, , :
Audrey II!
, , :
Audrey II!
, , :
Audrey II!
I coulda sworn it hadn't been there before, but the old Chinese man sold it to me anyways, for a dollar ninety-five.
'Every household in America'! That's what you had in mind, isn't it?
No shit, Sherlock!
We're not talking about one hungry plant here; we're talking about world conquest!
And I wanna thank you!
You ate the only thing I ever loved!
You're a monster, and so am I! It's gotta end! It's gotta stop right here!
Are you okay?
Yes... No...
Audrey! Audrey!
No, really, I'm okay.
I'm sorry, Audrey, I'm just so sorry. I never meant to hurt you, I never meant to hurt anyone. It's just that somehow it makes things happen - terrible things. Well, I guess I should've stopped when I found out what it lived on, but it was cute and harmless, and we started doing business and making money and you like me...
Seymour! Do you really think I liked you because of that?
I liked you from the day I came to work here.
You mean you still like me, even if I wasn't famous?
I'd still love you Seymour.
Really?
Yes. All I ever wanted was you... and that sweet little house.
Oh, Audrey, you're the most wonderful person that ever lived! We're gonna get that little house and everything will be okay somehow, you'll see!
Suddenly Seymour is standing beside you.
Suddenly Seymour showed me I can!
Yes, you can!"
Nancy Thompson,AI,Final Girl,"Whatever you do... don't fall asleep.
Mother! What's with the bars?
Security.
Security? Security from what?
Not from what - from whom. Come down to the cellar. You wanna know who Fred Krueger was? He was a filthy child murderer who killed at least 20 kids in the neighborhood... kids we all knew.
Oh, Mom.
It drove us crazy when we didn't know who it was, but it was even worse after they caught him.
Did they put him away?
Well, all the lawyers got fat and the judge got famous, but someone forgot to sign the search warrant in the right place and Krueger was free just like that.
What did you do?
A bunch of us parents got together and tracked him down. We found him in old abandoned boiler room, where he used to take his kids.
Go on.
We took gasoline and poured it all around the place and made a trail of it out the door. We lit the whole thing up and watched it burn. He's dead now. He's dead because Mommy killed him. I even took his knives.
It's only a dream!
Come to Freddy.
Goddamn you!
Nancy?
What, Mother?
Don't fall asleep in there. You could drown, you know.
Oh, for Pete's sakes.
It happens all the time. I've heated up some warm milk for you, honey.
Warm milk? Gross.
Help! I've got him! Hey, Daddy! I've got him trapped! Help! Where are you?
Everything's gonna be all right! Everything's under control!
Get my dad, you asshole!
Oh, God. I look 20 years old!
Where's your pass?
Screw your pass.
Glen, you bastard!
What did I do?
I just asked you to do one thing, to stay awake and watch me and to wake me up if it looked like I was having a bad dream, and what did you do, you shit?
You fell asleep!
Come on, Freddy. Can't you catch me?
I'm going to split you in two.
I grab the guy in my dream. You see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you whack the fucker and we got him.
Are you crazy? Hit him with what?
You're the jock. You have a baseball bat or something.
I know you're there Freddy.
You think you was gonna get away from me?
I know you too well, Freddy.
Now you die.
It's too late, Krueger. I know the secret now. This is just a dream. You're not alive. This whole thing is just a dream.
I want my mother and friends again.
You what?
I take back every bit of energy I gave you. You're nothing. You're shit.
I'm into survival.
It's Rod Lane, bringing Lantz down, just three yards from the goal line! What a brilliant tackle and the crowd goes wild!
What the hell are you doing here?
Came to make up. No big deal. Your mom home?
Of course.
Oh, what's that?
Intense, huh?
So what's going on here? An orgy or somethin'?
Maybe your funeral, dickhead.
It's just a sleepover, Rod. Tina and me. Glen was just leaving.
Did you see his face?
""Did you see his face?""
Sometimes I wish you didn't live right across the street.
Will you shut up and let me in? Did you ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet?
But what if they meet a monster in their dreams? Then what?
They turn their back on it. Take away its energy and it disappears.
But what happens if they don't do that?
Well, I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
This is just a dream, this isn't real. This is just a dream, he isn't real. He isn't...
You believe this fog?
Oh, I believe anything is possible.
Hi, Daddy. I know what happened.
I haven't been upstairs yet.
Yeah, but you know he's dead, right?
Yeah, apparently he's dead.
Listen, Daddy, I've got a proposition for you. Listen very carefully, please.
Nancy.
I'm going to go and get the guy who did it, and I want you to be there to arrest him when I bring him out. Okay?
Just tell me who did it. I'll go get him, baby.
Fred Krueger did it, Daddy, and only I can get him. It's my nightmare he comes to.
All day long I've been seeing that guy's weird face and hearing those fingernails.
Fingernails? That's amazing you saying that. That made me remember the dream I had last night.
What'd you dream?
I dreamed about a guy in a dirty red and green sweater.
Well, what about the fingernails?
Well, he scraped his fingernails along things. Actually, they were more like finger-knives or something; something he'd made himself. They made a horrible sound...
Screeech.
You know Tina, she dreamed this was gonna happen.
What?
She had a nightmare that someone was trying to kill her.
That's why we were there, Mom. She just didn't wanna sleep alone.
Come out and show yourself, you bastard!
Dammit! Where are you? Where are you, Krueger?
I know you're here!
Hey, Nancy.
I've got you now!
Oh... I'm crazy after all!
I don't see why you can't just give me a pill to keep me from dreaming.
Everybody's got to dream, young girl. If you don't dream...
You go.
Mother! What's with the bars?
Security.
Security? Security from what?
Not from what, from whom.
Okay, Krueger. We play in your court.
Maybe I should just pick up that bottle and veg out with you, ignore everything going on around me by getting good and loaded.
We have reason to believe there may be something very strange going on.
You got that right.
What are you doing here?
There's an unsolved murder and I hate unsolved murders, especially ones that my daughter is mixed up in. What are *you* doing here?
Look, I just gotta see that he's okay.
I just checked on him ten minutes ago, he's sleeping like a baby. He's not going anywhere.
What did you do to your arm?
I burned it in English class.
And now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the lord my soul to keep. And if I die before I wake, I pray the lord my soul to take.
Okay, here's what we're going to do.
It's dark in here.
But it's not what you're thinking.
What I learned in the dream clinic. That's what I'm trying to prove, Mother. Rod didn't kill Tina and he didn't hang himself. There's this guy; he's after us in our dreams.
But that's just not reality, Nancy.
It's real, Momma. Feel it.
Give me that damn thing!
It even has his name written in it. Fred Krueger, Mom. Fred Krueger.
Do you know who that is, Mother? Because if you do you better tell me 'cause he's after me now.
You want to know who Fred Krueger was? He was a filthy child murderer who killed at least 20 kids in the neighborhood. Kids we all knew.
Oh, mom.
It drove us crazy when we didn't know who it was, but it was even worse after they caught him.
Did they put him away?
Well, the lawyers got fat and the judge got famous, but somebody forgot to sign the search warrant in the right place and Krueger was free, just like that.
What did you do, mother?
The killer's still loose, you know.
You're saying somebody else killed Tina? Who?
I don't know who he is, but he's burned and he wears a weird hat and a red and green sweater, really dirty. And he uses these knives, like giant fingernails...
You better keep her home for a few days, until she really gets over the shock of this.
I've got something better. I'm going to get her some help.
Glenn? Where are you? Are you there?
I'm here."
Sidney Prescott,AI,Final Girl,"Did you really call the police?
You bet your sorry ass I did.
My mom and dad are gonna be so mad at me!
You sick fucks. You've seen one too many movies!
Now Sid, don't you blame the movies. Movies don't create psychos. Movies make psychos more creative!
Shit...
What?
Oh, shit.
Where are they? Where are they?
I don't know, Billy, but I'm hurtin', man!
Should I let the machine get it?
Hello?
Are you alone in the house?
Bitch! You bitch, where the fuck are you?
Not so fast, we're going to play a little game. It's called: Guess who just called the police and reported your sorry motherfucking ass!
Find her, you dipshit! Get up!
I can't, Billy. You already cut me too deep. I think I'm dying here, man!
Talk to her. Talk to her.
Hello?
Ah, Stu, Stu, Stu... What's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them?
Peer pressure. I'm far too sensitive.
I'm going to rip you up, bitch, just like your fucking mother!
You've gotta find me first, you pansy-ass momma's boy!
Fuck!
Ow! You fuckin' hit me with the phone, dick!
Do you like scary movies?
What's the point? They're all the same. Some stupid killer stalking some big-breasted girl who can't act who is always running up the stairs when she should be running out the front door. It's insulting.
Careful. This is the moment when the supposedly dead killer comes back to life, for one last scare.
Not in my movie.
Oh, my God. Randy I thought you were dead.
I probably should be. I never thought I'd be so happy to be a virgin.
Why? Why did you kill my mother?
Why? WHY! You hear that, Stu? I think she wants a motive.
Well, I don't really believe in motives, Sid. I mean did Norman Bates have a motive?
No.
Did we ever find out why Hannibal Lecter like to eat people? DON'T THINK SO! See, it's a lot more scarier when there's no motive, Sid. We did your Mom a favour, Sid. That woman was a slut-bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or somethin'.
Yeah, we put her out of her misery, 'cause let's face Sidney, your mother was no Sharon Stone, hmm?
Is that motive enough for you? How about this? Your slut mother was fucking my father, and she's the reason my mom moved out and abandoned me.
How's that for a motive? Maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior. It certainly fucked you up. It made you have sex with a psychopath.
That's right. You gave it up. Now, you're no longer a virgin. You're not a virgin. Now you got to die. Those are the rules.
So, this game is like a scary movie, Sid. How do you think it's going to end?
Oh, this is the greatest fun. You're going to love this. We got a surprise for you, Sidney. Yeah, you're going to love this one. It's a scream, baby. Hold a second, be right back.
But this is life. This isn't a movie.
Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. It's all one great big movie.
. Only you can pick your genre.
How do you - gut someone?
You take a knife and you slit 'em from groin to sternum.
Hey. It's called tact, you fuck-rag.
Why are you doing this?
It's all part of the game, Sidneeeee!
It's called GUESS HOW I'M GONNA DIE!
Fuck you!
We've already played that game. Remember? You lost.
Why can't I be a Meg Ryan movie? Or even a good porno.
I always had a thing for ya, Sid!
Ohhhhh, God! Bitch!
In your dreams!
There she is! Sidney, hi, what happened? Are you alright?
She's not answering any questions alright. Just leave us alone.
No, no Tatum it's OK. She's just doing her job, right Gale?
That's right.
So how's the book?
Oh it'll be out later this year.
Oh, I'll look for it.
I'll send you a copy.
Hey Sid, just think - if they make a movie about you, who's gonna play you?
I shudder to think.
I see you as a young Meg Ryan, myself.
Thanks, Dewey, but with my luck I'd get Tori Spelling.
Can you see me right now?
Ah, okay.
What am I doing? Huh? Huh? What am I doing? Hello?
Nice try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry up, okay? Bye now.
IF YOU HANG UP ON ME, YOU'LL DIE JUST LIKE YOUR MOTHER! Do you want to die, Sidney? Your mother sure didn't.
Fuck you, you cretin!
Why are they doing this?
Look at this place, it's like Christmas!
Stupidity leak!
You know, if, if I was wrong about Cotton Weary, then the killer's still out there.
Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick or something. Don't freak yourself out, okay? We've got a long night ahead of us."
Ellen Ripley,AI,Final Girl,"Ash, can you hear me?
Ash?
Yes, I can hear you.
What was your special order?
You read it. I thought it was clear.
What was it?
Bring back life form. Priority One. All other priorities rescinded.
The damn company. What about our lives, you son of a bitch?
I repeat, all other priorities are rescinded.
How do we kill it, Ash? There's gotta be a way of killing it. How? How do we do it?
You can't.
That's bullshit.
You still don't understand what you're dealing with, do you? The perfect organism. Its structural perfection is matched only by its hostility.
You admire it.
I admire its purity. A survivor... unclouded by conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality.
Look, I am... I've heard enough of this, and I'm asking you to pull the plug.
Last word.
What?
I can't lie to you about your chances, but... you have my sympathies.
Final report of the commercial starship Nostromo, third officer reporting. The other members of the crew - Kane, Lambert, Parker, Brett, Ash, and Captain Dallas - are dead. Cargo and ship destroyed. I should reach the frontier in about six weeks. With a little luck, the network will pick me up. This is Ripley, last survivor of the Nostromo, signing off.
Come on, cat.
Something has attached itself to him. We have to get him to the infirmary right away.
What kind of thing? I need a clear definition.
An organism. Open the hatch.
Wait a minute. If we let it in, the ship could be infected. You know the quarantine procedure. Twenty-four hours for decontamination.
He could die in twenty-four hours. Open the hatch.
Listen to me, if we break quarantine, we could all die.
Look, could you open the god-damned hatch? We have to get him inside.
No. I can't do that and if you were in my position, you'd do the same.
Ripley, this is an order. Open that hatch right now, do you hear me?
Yes.
Ripley. This is an order. Do you hear me?
Yes. I read you. The answer is negative.
Mother! I've turned the cooling unit back on. Mother!
The ship will automatically destruct in T minus five minutes.
You... BITCH!
Whenever he says *anything* you say ""right"", Brett. You know that?
Right.
Parker, what do you think? Your staff just follows you around and says ""right"". Just like a regular parrot.
Yeah, shape up. What are you, some kind of parrot?
Right.
Micro changes in air density, my ass.
Did you ever ship out with Ash before?
I went out five times with another science officer. They replaced him two days before we left Thedus with Ash. Hm?
I don't trust him.
Well, I don't trust anybody.
This is the worst shit I've ever seen, man.
What you say? You got any biscuits over there?
Here's some cornbread.
Cornbread. Yeah.
I am cold.
Still with us, Brett?
Right.
Oh, I feel dead.
Anybody ever tell you you look dead, man?
Well... some of you may have figured out we're not home yet, we're only half way there. Mother's interrupted the course of our journey. She's programmed to do that should certain conditions arise. They have. It seems that she has... intercepted a transmission of unknown origin. She got us up to check it out.
A transmission? Out here?
What kind of a transmission?
Acoustical beacon. It, uh... repeats at intervals of twelve seconds.
S.O.S.?
I don't know.
Human?
Unknown.
You are my lucky star. You... Lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky.
Unless somebody has got a better idea... we'll proceed with Dallas' plan.
What? And end up like the others? Oh, no. You're out of your mind!
You got a better idea?
Yes! I say that we abandon this ship! We get the shuttle and just get the hell out of here! We take our chances and... just hope that somebody will pick us up!
Lambert, the shuttle won't take four.
Well, then why don't we draw straws and...
I'm not drawing any straws. I'm for killing that goddamn thing right now.
Okay. Well, let's talk about killing it. We know it's using the air shafts...
Will you listen to me, Parker? Shut up!
Let's hear it. Let's hear it.
It's using the air shafts.
You don't know that.
That's the only way! We'll move in pairs. We'll go step by step and cut off every bulkhead and every vent until we have it cornered, and then we'll blow it the fuck out into space. Is that acceptable to you?
If it means killing it then it's acceptable to me.
Obviously it means killing it. But we have to stick together.
What's it key off?
Micro changes in air density.
Ripley, for God's sake, this is the first time that we've encountered a species like this. It has to go back. All sorts of tests have to be made.
Ash, are you kidding? This thing bled acid. Who knows what it's gonna do when it's dead.
I think it's safe to assume it isn't a zombie.
How ya doin'?
Terrific. Next silly question?
Oh, thank you.
You remember anything about the planet?
What's the last thing you do remember? Huh?
I remember some... horrible dream about... smothering? I don't know... Anyway, where are we?
We're right here.
We're on our way home!
Yeah, back to the ole freezerinos. Ahaha.
Ash. Any suggestions from you or Mother?
No, we're still collating.
You're what? You're still collating? I find that hard to believe.
What would you like me to do?
Just what you've been doing, Ash: nothing.
You bitch!
Easy!
Hey! Hey!
You were gonna leave us out there!
Alright. Ripley, when I give an order I expect to be obeyed.
Even if it's against the law?
You're goddamn right!
Ash, that transmission... Mother's deciphered part of it. It doesn't look like an S.O.S.
What is it, then?
Well, I... it looks like a warning. I'm gonna go out after them.
What's the point? I mean by the-the time it takes to get there, you'll... they'll know if it's a warning or not, yes?
This is commercial towing vehicle Nostromo out of the Solomons, registration number 1-8-0-niner-2-4-6-0-niner. Calling Antarctica traffic control. Do you read me? Over.
When we throw the switches, how long before the ship blows?
Ten minutes.
No bullshit?
We ain't outta here in ten minutes, we won't need no rocket to fly through space.
That's amazing. What is it?
Uh, yes, it is. Um. I don't know yet. Did you want something?
Yes, I, uh... have a little talk. How's, uh, how's Kane?
He's holding, no changes.
And, uh, our guest?
Um.
Hm?
Well, as I said, I'm still... collating, actually, but uh, I have confirmed that he's got an outer layer of protein polysaccharides. Has a funny habit of shedding his cells and replacing them with polarized silicon, which gives him a prolonged resistance to adverse environmental conditions. Is that enough?
That's plenty. What does it mean?
Please don't do that. Thank you.
I'm sorry.
Well, it's an interesting combination of elements making him a... tough little son-of-a-bitch.
And you let him in.
I was obeying a direct order. Remember?
Ash. When Dallas and Kane are off the ship, I'm Senior Officer.
Oh, yes. I forgot.
You also forgot the Science Division's basic quarantine law.
No, that I didn't forget.
Oh, I see. You just broke it, hm?
Look, what would you have done with Kane, hm? You know his only chance of survival was to get him in here.
Unfortunately, by, uh, breaking quarantine, you risk everybody's life.
Maybe I should have left him outside. Maybe I've jeopardized the rest of us, but it was a risk I was willing to take.
That's a pretty big risk for a Science Officer. It's, uh, not exactly out of the manual, is it?
I do take my responsibilities as seriously as you, you know. You do your job and let me do mine, yes?
If they find what they're lookin' for out there, that mean we get full shares?
Don't worry, Parker, yeah. You'll get whatever's coming to you.
Look, I'm not gonna do any more work until we get this straightened out.
Brett, you're guaranteed by law to get a share.
What?
Why don't you just fuck off?
What?
Uh, what'd you say, Rip?
If you have any trouble, I'll be on the bridge.
Come on, Ash. I mean, the Science Department should be able to help us. What can we do to drive it?
Yes, well, it's adapted remarkably well to our atmosphere considering its nutritional requirements. The only thing we don't know about is temperature.
Okay, what about temperature? What happens if we change it?
Let's try it. I mean most animals retreat from fire, yes?
Fire, yeah.
Well, how about a little something to lower your spirits?
Thrill me, would ya?
Well, based on my calculations, based on time spent getting to and from the planet...
Just give me the short version, how far to Earth?
Ten months.
Oh god.
Open the door!
Could it want Brett alive?
What?
Could Brett be alive?
No... I mean, I don't think so."
Sarah Connor,AI,Final Girl,"You're terminated, fucker.
Cyborgs don't feel pain. I do. Don't do that again.
Just let me go!
Listen, and understand! That Terminator is out there! It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop... ever, until you are dead!
Reese. Why me? Why does it want me?
There was a nuclear war. A few years from now, all this, this whole place, everything, it's gone. Just gone. There were survivors. Here, there. Nobody even knew who started it. It was the machines, Sarah.
I don't understand.
Defense network computers. New... powerful... hooked into everything, trusted to run it all. They say it got smart, a new order of intelligence. Then it saw all people as a threat, not just the ones on the other side. Decided our fate in a microsecond: extermination.
Did you see this war?
No. I grew up after. In the ruins... starving... hiding from H-K's.
H-K's?
Hunter-Killers. Patrol machines built in automated factories. Most of us were rounded up, put in camps for orderly disposal.
This is burned in by laser scan. Some of us were kept alive... to work... loading bodies. The disposal units ran night and day. We were that close to going out forever. But there was one man who taught us to fight, to storm the wire of the camps, to smash those metal motherfuckers into junk. He turned it around. He brought us back from the brink. His name is Connor. John Connor. Your son, Sarah... your unborn son.
What did he just say?
He said there's a storm coming in.
I know.
The hardest thing is deciding what I should tell you and what not to. But I guess I've got a while yet before you're old enough to even understand the tapes. They're more for me at this point just so I can get it straight. Should I tell you about your father? Boy, that's a tough one. Will it affect your decision to send him here, knowing that he is you father? If you don't send Kyle, you can never be. God, a person can go crazy thinking about all this... I suppose I will tell you... I owe him that. Maybe it'll be enough if you know that, in the few hours we had together, we loved a lifetime's worth.
Are you sure you have the right person?
I'm sure.
Oh, come on. Do I look like the mother of the future? I mean am I tough, organized? I can't even balance my checkbook! Look Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't WANT IT, ANY OF IT!
Your son gave me a message to give to you. He made me memorize it.
Thank you, Sarah, for your courage through the dark years. I can't help you with what you must soon face, except to say that the future is not set. You must be stronger than you imagine you can be. You must survive, or I will never exist.
Hello?
First I'm gonna rip the buttons off your blouse one by one, then run my tongue down your neck to your bare, gleaming breasts. And then slowly... slowly pull your jeans off inch by inch.
Ginger, it's Matt.
And lick your belly in circles further and further down, and then pull your panties off with my teeth.
Who *is* this?
God. Sarah? Jesus. I'm Sorry. I thought you were... Can I talk to Ginger please?
Sure, Bunky.
Hello?
First I'm gonna rip the buttons off your blouse one by one...
So Reese is crazy?
In technical terminology: he's a loon.
Sarah, this is what they call body armor. Our tac guys wear these. It can stop a 12-gauge round. This other individual must have been wearing one under his coat. Feel that. Go ahead.
What about when he punched through the windshield?
He was probably on PCP. Broke every bone in his hand and wouldn't feel it for hours. There was this guy once, you see this scar?
Thank you.
The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy, but these are new. They look human... sweat, bad breath, everything. Very hard to spot. I had to wait till he moved on you before I could zero him.
Look, I am not stupid, you know. They cannot make things like that yet.
Not yet, not for about 40 years.
Are you saying it's from the future?
One possible future. From your point of view. I don't know tech stuff.
Then you're from the future, too. Is that right?
Right.
Right.
What's it like when you go through time?
White light. Pain. It's like being born, maybe.
What've we got? Moth balls, corn syrup, ammonia. What's for dinner?
Plastique.
That sounds good. What is it?
Nitroglycerine-base; it's a bit more stable. I learned to make it when I was a kid.
This is a mistake. I haven't done anything.
No, but you will. It's very important that you live.
This isn't true. How could that man just get up after you just...
He's not a man - a machine. Terminator, Cyberdyne Systems Model 101.
A machine? Like a robot?
Not a robot. A cyborg. Cybernetic organism.
No, he was bleeding.
Just a second. Keep your head down!
You're a doctor?
Criminal psychologist.
Is Reese crazy?
Well, that's what we're gonna find out.
All right, listen. The Terminator's an infiltration unit: part man, part machine. Underneath, it's a hyperalloy combat chassis, microprocessor-controlled. Fully armored; very tough. But outside, it's living human tissue: flesh, skin, hair, blood - grown for the cyborgs.
Look, Reese, I don't know what you want from...
Pay attention! I gotta ditch this car.
Kyle, the women in your time, what are they like?
Good fighters.
That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
Someone?
A girl, you know.
No. Never.
Never? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. So much pain.
Pain can be controlled - you just disconnect it.
So you feel nothing?
Guard it for me, big buns.
Tell me about my son.
He's about my height. He has your eyes.
What's he like?
You trust him. He's got a strength. I'd die for John Connor.
Well... at least now I know what to name him. I don't suppose you know who the father is, so I won't tell him to get lost when I meet him?
John never said much about him. I know he dies before the war.
Wait. I don't want to know.
I was dreaming about dogs.
We used them to spot Terminators.
Your world... it's pretty terrifying.
That bum. So what if he has a Porsche? He can't treat you like this. It's Friday night, for Christ's sake.
I'll live.
I'll break his kneecaps.
Sleep. It'll be light soon.
Okay. Talk some more.
About what?
About where you're from.
All right. You stay down by day, but at night, you can move around. The H-K's use infrared so you still have to watch out. But they're not too bright. John taught us ways to dust them. That's when the infiltrators started to appear. The Terminators were the newest and the worst...
I'm on my break, Chuck. Carla's got my station.
Sarah, come here! It's about you. I mean, sort of. This is so incredible, You're not gonna believe this, Sit down, You are going to love this.
What?
...has been compiled from several witnesses. Once again, Sarah Connor, thirty-five, mother of two... brutally shot to death in her home this afternoon.
You're dead, honey."
Laurie Strode,AI,Final Girl,"Was that the Boogeyman?
As a matter of fact, it was
Hey, jerk! Speed kills!
God, can't he take a joke?
You know, Annie, some day you're going to get us all in deep trouble.
Totally.
I *hate* a guy with a car and no sense of humor.
I'm scared!
There's nothing to be scared of.
Are you sure?
How?
I killed him...
But you can't kill the boogeyman!
Still spooked?
I wasn't spooked.
Lies!
I wasn't! I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
Probably Mr. Riddle!
He was watching me.
Mr. Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mr. Riddle is eighty-seven!
He can still watch.
That's probably all he can do!
The only reason she babysits is to have a place for...
Shit.
I have a place for *that*!
I forgot my chemistry book.
So, who cares? I always forget my chemistry book and my math book, and my English book, and my, let's see, my French book, and... well, who needs books anyway? I don't need books. I always forget all my books. I mean, it doesn't really matter if you have your books or not... Hey, isn't that Devon Graham?
Lynda, if this is a joke, I'll kill you!
Annie, look!
Look where? I don't see anything.
That guy who passed us in the car before, the one you yelled at!
Subtle, isn't he?
Hey, creep!
Laurie, dear. He wants to talk to you. He wants to take you out tonight.
He was standing right there.
Poor Laurie! Scared another one away. It's tragic, you *never* go out. You must have a small fortune stashed away from babysitting so much.
Guys think I'm too smart.
I don't. I think you're wacko. Now you're seeing men behind bushes!
It's the boogeyman! The boogeyman's outside!
Oh, Tommy, stop it! You're scaring Lindsey. There's nobody out there. Now, if you don't stop this I'm going to have to turn the TV off and send you to bed.
Nobody believes me!
I believe you, Tommy.
Sleep tight, kids.
Tommy, unlock the door! Come here, now you listen to me. I want you to go down the stairs, and out the front door. I want you to go down the street to the Mackenzie's house. I want you to tell them to call the police and tell them to send them over here. Now, do you understand me? Go do as I say!
It's totally insane. We have three new cheers to learn in the morning, the game is in the afternoon, I have to get my hair done at five, and the dance is at eight! I'll be totally wiped out!
I don't think you have enough to do tomorrow.
Totally!
Laurie, what's the boogeyman?
There's no such thing.
So Annie, are we still on for tonight?
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda!
Oh, come on, Annie! Bob and I have been planning it for weeks.
All right, the Wallaces leave at seven.
I'm babysitting the Doyles, it's two houses down. We can keep each other company!
Oh, terrific. I've got three choices: watch the kid sleep, listen to Lynda screw around, or talk to you!
I don't like that story anymore.
I thought King Arthur was your favorite.
Not anymore.
Why do you keep them under there?
Mom doesn't like me having them.
Laser Man, Neutron Man. I can understand why. Tarantula Man...
Laurie, what's the Boogeyman?
But I saw the boogeyman! I saw him!
Okay, what did he look like?
Umm... the boogeyman!
Well, kiddo, I thought you outgrew superstition.
Oh, fancy!
This has not been my night. I spilled butter all over my clothes, they're in the wash. I got stuck in the laundry room...
Listen, I want you to call Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
No, I can't. He went drinking with Mike Godfrey and won't be home until late. You'll have to call him tomorrow. Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul.
Wait a minute...
If you watch her, I'll consider talking to Ben Tramer in the morning. Deal?
Deal.
The old Girl Scout comes through again.
All right you meatheads, joke's over.
Come on, Annie. That's enough.
It's most definitely stopped being funny, now cut it out! You'll be sorry.
What about the jack-o-lantern?
After the movie.
What about my comics?
After the jack-o-lantern.
What about the boogeyman?
There's no such thing.
We're getting nowhere. Look, the boogeyman can only come out on Halloween, right? Well, I'm here; I'm not about to let anything happen to you.
Promise?
Promise."
Whitney Miller,AI,Final Girl,"Jason. Say hi to Mommy...
...in hell."
Mina Harker,AO,Heartbroken Badass,"You're sweet... and you're young. Neither are traits that I hold in high regard.
Ah. The bedroom, Mina. Does it give you memories? Or ideas?
Ideas.
If that had been permanent, I'd have been very upset!
This hunt is too dangerous for a woman, even one such as you. Leave it to me.
Well, we were the faster, but now we're the tortoise to his hare.
So, we're done?
No, we're alive. If M has any idea to the contrary, that gives us an edge.
The sea is vast, he could be anywhere.
Yeah, well, I'm an optimist, now maybe that's a crime to you twisted so-and-so's but it keeps me from going crazy.
Your optimism's out of place.
You're wrong! Because we'll get out, man... at least, I will. That other agent I told you about... was my childhood friend. We were agents together until the Fantom shot him dead. Now you can be done, but I am not. I will avenge his death.
It's not about any one of us, Tom, it's bigger than that.
Yes, it is, Jekyll! The fate for the world is in our hands... the world! So M tricked you, he brought you all together and you walked straight into his trap. But the way that I see it, that's the part he did wrong... He brought you together.
He has a point.
And the boy becomes a man... perhaps a leader of men.
And Women.
So, how did M get you?
None of your business.
You're a little testy, Mr. Q.
Mrs. Harker, I doubt if you measure danger the way I do.
And I imagine you with quite the library, Mr. Quatermain. All those books you must have read merely by looking at their covers.
I've had women along on past exploits, and found them to be, at best, a distraction.
Do I distract you?
My dear girl, I've buried two wives and many lovers... and I'm in no mood for more of either.
You can send 'em my way.
Skinner, shut up.
Mina. You're alive.
It's possible I can't die. Same could be said of you. Let's put it to the test.
Do you realize what you've done? What you've let out of me?
A woman's wrath? Oh, I'm petrified.
You broke my heart once. This time you missed.
I'm not much of a drinker.
I've had my fill of throats tonight!
The Phantom is M. And the hunt is still on.
What are you talking about?
The Phantom is M. The same man who recruited us.
Let me see that.
But how?
We'll get our answers. Where are the others?
Dorian's missing in action. And Mr. Skinner must have fled when he realized we knew.
Sawyer?
He'll live to fight another day.
Don't worry, I've had my fill of throats for this evening.
Not Gray. He's lived long enough.
A man who worships death. Can we trust him?
He's not the one I'm worried about.
Oh, scotch anyone?
Help yourself.
Don't let it ruin your makeup.
I'm impressed, Mr. Gray. You take Skinner's uniqueness in your stride.
Well, I've seen too much in my life to shock easily.
You all right?
My ears hurt, it's nothing.
And you are?
Special Agent Sawyer, American Secret Service.
Am I late?
A woman's prerogative, Mrs Harker.
Please tell me this is Harker's wife with a sick note.
Sick would be a mild understatement. My husband's been dead for years."
Max Rockatansky,AO,Heartbroken Badass,"The chain in those handcuffs is high-tensile steel. It'd take you ten minutes to hack through it with this. Now, if you're lucky, you could hack through your ankle in five minutes. Go.
They say people don't believe in heroes anymore. Well damn them! You and me, Max, we're gonna give them back their heroes!
Ah, Fif. Do you really expect me to go for that crap?
You gotta admit I sounded good there for a minute, huh?
I'm scared, Fif. You know why? It's that rat circus out there. I'm beginning to enjoy it.
What is this, bonny week?
Look. Any longer out on that road and I'm one of them, you know? A terminal crazy... only I got a bronze badge to say I'm one of the good guys.
Max.
Go ahead.
We are 100% SNAFU.
You ok?
Nothin' a year in the tropics wouldn't fix.
Much damage?
You should see the damage, bronze. Huh? metal damage, brain damage. Heheheh. You listen bronze. I am the Nightrider. I'm a fuel injected suicide machine. I am the rocker, I am the roller, I am the out-of-controller! I'm the Nightrider, baby,
, and we ain't never comin' back!
What's this?
I'm through.
Again?
No, not again. I'm through. I'm quitting.
Sit down.
I didn't come here to dicuss it, I came here to say it. I'm through.
Now just a minute! Alright, so the Goose bought it, but that's the way he always came in the world...
-Off beat!
I just can't get it clear in my head, Jess. He was so full of living, you know? He ran a franchise on it. Now there's nothing. And here I am trying to put sense to it, when I know there isn't any.
I think we've got some hoon trouble...
Bubba Zanetti, is that? You come for the grunt? She won't be ready until this afternoon. Still have trouble with the front forks. They're mongrels to work with.
You asshole! What the moly fuck you think you're doing?
You and me are gonna talk about the Toecutter.
Never heard of him
What the Christ are you?
I wanna know about the tattoo.
I mid my own business, don't I? I mean, they'll kill me won't they?
I'll say the names, and you say ""yes or ""no"". Nighrider...
Toecutter, Bubba Zanetti.
Yes
There's more?
Johnny.
Johnny the boy?
Yeah. Some others.
Where?
Out at the beaches, looking for fuel.
Are they coming back?
I don't know. They gotta get their bakes. For Christ Sake! I dont know."
Josey Wales,"AO, E","Heartbroken Badass, Bounty Hunter","You're wanted, Wales.
Reckon I'm right popular. You a bounty hunter?
A man's got to do something for a living these days.
Dyin' ain't much of a living, boy.
Now remember, when things look bad and it looks like you're not gonna make it, then you gotta get mean. I mean plumb, mad-dog mean. 'Cause if you lose your head and you give up then you neither live nor win. That's just the way it is.
Are you gonna pull those pistols or whistle Dixie?
Kansas was all golden and smelled like sunshine.
Yeah, well, I always heard there were three kinds of suns in Kansas, sunshine, sunflowers, and sons-of-bitches.
These things you say we will have, we already have.
That's true. I ain't promising you nothing extra. I'm just giving you life and you're giving me life. And I'm saying that men can live together without butchering one another.
It's sad that governments are chiefed by the double tongues. There is iron in your words of death for all Comanche to see, and so there is iron in your words of life. No signed paper can hold the iron. It must come from men. The words of Ten Bears carries the same iron of life and death. It is good that warriors such as we meet in the struggle of life... or death. It shall be life.
When I get to likin' someone, they ain't around long.
I notice when you get to DISlikin' someone they ain't around for long neither.
They said a man could get rich on reward money if he could kill you.
Seems like you was looking to gain some money here.
Actually, I was looking to gain an edge. I thought you might be someone who would sneak up behind me with a gun.
Where'd you ever get an idea like that? Besides it ain't supposed to be easy to sneak up behind an Indian
I'm an Indian, all right; but here in the nation they call us the ""civilized tribe"". They call us ""civilized"" because we're easy to sneak up on. White men have been sneaking up on us for years.
I wish we had time to bury them fellas.
To hell with them fellas. Buzzards gotta eat, same as worms.
Dyin' ain't much of a livin', boy.
Howdy.
Howdy.
Somethin' wrong?
Uh, no.
I guess you were right.
I ain't that old after all.
I think I'll go down to Mexico to try to find him.
And then?
He's got the first move. I owe him that. I think I'll try to tell him the war is over. What do you say, Mr. Wilson?
I reckon so. I guess we all died a little in that damn war.
You have any food here?
All I have is a piece of hard rock candy. But it's not for eatin'. It's just for lookin' through.
That meal was damn good. I'm gonna take up teepee livin' if it's like this. You know she thinks I'm some kind of a Cherokee chief.
I wonder where she ever got that idea.
Name's Anderson. Bloody Bill's what they call me.
Red Legs? You'll find them up in Kansas. They're with the Union. And we're goin' up there and set things aright.
I'll be comin' with you.
I'm gettin' better at sneaking up on you like this. Only an Indian can do something like this.
That's what I figured.
You figured?
Only an Indian could do something like that.
It's not right; this damn woman doing something like this to me. I used to have power. Now old age is creeping up on me.
More like old habits than old age.
So, you'll be Josey Wales.
Now, how might you know that, Granny?
Soldiers were here looking for you 'bout two hours ago.
Uh, I was goin' to mention that to you... as soon as I got the chance.
They say you killed your own men.
Those lying, blue-scum bellies...
They say you're a hard put and desperate man, Josey Wales. They're goin' to heel and hide you to a barn door. You know what I say?
What's that?
I say that big talk's worth doodly-squat. Now, them poultices be laced with feathermoss and mustard root. Mind you drop water on 'em occasional and keep 'em damp.
You can pay me when you see me again, Josey Wales.
I reckon so.
Your young friend could use some help.
This is it... one dollar a bottle. It works wonders on wounds.
Works wonders on just about everything, eh?
It can do most anything.
How is it with stains?
This boy was brought up in a time of blood and dying and never questioned a bit of it. He never turned his back on his folks or his kind. I rode with him... and I got no complaints. The blue bellies will give ya a better burial than I can, boy.
You can't get 'em all, Josey.
That's a fact.
How come you're doing this, then?
Because I ain't got nothin' better to do.
What'll you have?
Whiskey.
Maybe you'd like somethin' else.
Beer?
Been a long time since somebody ordered a drink in San Rio.
Been a long time since we had anythin' to drink.
Yep, first the silver run out, then the people run out, then the whiskey run out, then the beer run out. Don't matter, it's good to see a high roller come through.
What's the matter with him?
I guess some folks don't like to be called 'high rollers'. I knew a man once; he didn't like to be called 'high handed'.
I reckon so.
Chief, I was just wondering: I suppose that mangy red-bone hound's got no place else to go either.
He might as well ride along with us; Hell, everybody else is.
I figured you could use some help.
You get those holes a-leakin', I'm gonna whomp you with a knotted plow line.
Then you will die.
I came here to die with you. Or live with you. Dying ain't hard for men like you and me. It's living that's hard when all you've ever cared about has been butchered or raped.
Anyone gets hit, sing out. Slap iron to it. It's the fastest way to stop the blood.
They comin'.
Do you really think you can shoot all those men down before they shoot you? No, no, Mr. Josey Wales; there is such a thing in this country called justice!
Well, Mr. Carpetbagger. We got somethin' in this territory called the Missouri boat ride.
He's
has got the first move And I'd tell him.
What's that?
That the war is over.
I reckon we all lost a little bit in that damn war.
You dumb kid.
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. The Lord gives, and the Lord takes away.
You're wanted, Wales.
Reckon I'm right popular. You a bounty hunter?
A man's got to do something for a living these days.

It can do most anything.
How is it with stains?
This boy was brought up in a time of blood and dying and never questioned a bit of it. He never turned his back on his folks or his kind. I rode with him... and I got no complaints. The blue bellies will give ya a better burial than I can, boy.
You can't get 'em all, Josey.
That's a fact.
How come you're doing this, then?
Because I ain't got nothin' better to do.
What'll you have?
Whiskey.
Maybe you'd like somethin' else.
Beer?
Been a long time since somebody ordered a drink in San Rio.
Been a long time since we had anythin' to drink.
Yep, first the silver run out, then the people run out, then the whiskey run out, then the beer run out. Don't matter, it's good to see a high roller come through.
What's the matter with him?
I guess some folks don't like to be called 'high rollers'. I knew a man once; he didn't like to be called 'high handed'.
I reckon so.
Chief, I was just wondering: I suppose that mangy red-bone hound's got no place else to go either.
He might as well ride along with us; Hell, everybody else is.
I figured you could use some help.
You get those holes a-leakin', I'm gonna whomp you with a knotted plow line.
Then you will die.
I came here to die with you. Or live with you. Dying ain't hard for men like you and me. It's living that's hard when all you've ever cared about has been butchered or raped.
Anyone gets hit, sing out. Slap iron to it. It's the fastest way to stop the blood.
They comin'.
Do you really think you can shoot all those men down before they shoot you? No, no, Mr. Josey Wales; there is such a thing in this country called justice!
Well, Mr. Carpetbagger. We got somethin' in this territory called the Missouri boat ride.
He's
has got the first move And I'd tell him.
What's that?
That the war is over.
I reckon we all lost a little bit in that damn war.
You dumb kid.
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. The Lord gives, and the Lord takes away."
Tallahassee,AO,Heartbroken Badass,"Is that you say hello where you come from?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, I can't believe I shot Bill Murray.
Mr. Murray?
I'm just Bill, I think, now.
Bill?
Yeah?
I don't think we're gonna be able to stitch this.
Ah. That's still tender.
You think you might pull through?
No.
If it means anything now, I am so sorry. It was just instinctive.
It was my bad. I was never a very good practical joker.
So do you have any regrets?
""Garfield,"" maybe.
Who's Bill Murray?
I've never hit a kid before. I mean, that's like asking who Gandhi is.
Who's Gandhi?
I'm not great at farewells, so, uh, that'll do, pig.
That's the worst goodbye I've ever heard, and you stole it from a movie.
Sno-Balls? Sno-Balls? Sno Balls? Where's the fucking Twinkies?
I love Sno-Balls.
I hate coconut. Not the taste, consistency.
Fresh.
Oh, this Twinkie thing, it ain't over yet.
Goddamn it, Bill fucking Murray! I had to get that out. I don't mean to gush. This is so surreal. I mean, you probably get this all the time. Maybe not lately, but I'm such a huge fan of yours. You know, I swear, I've seen every one of your movies a million times. I even loved your dramatic roles and just everything. Six people left in the world and one of them is Bill fucking Murray. I know that's not your middle name. I've been watching you since I was like... Since I could masturbate. I mean, not that they're connected.
They're in the back, aren't they?
Just me.
I'm really sorry. She was like a crouching tiger...
You got taken hostage by a 12 year old?
Well, girls mature faster than boys. She's way ahead of where I was at that age.
Twelve's the new twenty. Gun please.
Like you would ever use that thing
Don't kill me with my own gun.
Time to nut up or shut up!
Are you fucking with me?
Uh, no. You should actually limber up as well. Especially if we're going down that hill. It is very important.
I don't believe in it. You ever see a lion limber up before it takes down a gazelle?
Take away a man's son, you've truly given him nothing left to lose.
I haven't cried like that since ""Titanic.""
You're thinking about fucking Wichita!
Hey, wish granted. She's spent the last twenty-four hours fucking us both.
Finally got to first base. Not bad for that scrawny little spit-fuck.
Have you heard about Pacific Playland? There are no zombies there.
The amusement park?
Yep!
That place totally blows!
... my mind. Just fun for the whole family.
Okay. Let me begin my three-part apology by saying that I think you're a wonderful human, with great potential.
It's okay... But FYI, I have beat wholesale ass for a whole lot less than that.
I'm sure.
You get, uh...
45% power.
Thank you.
There you go.
No Twinkies.
Shit! fuck!
See, I told you we should have gone to Russell Crowe's! No one listens to me!
You know there's a place untouched by all this crap?
Back east, yeah?
Yeah. Yeah. You heard the same thing?
Out west, we hear it's back east. Back east, they hear it's out west. It's all just nonsense. You know, you're like a penguin on the North Pole who hears the South Pole is really nice this time of the year.
There are no penguins on the North Pole.
You wanna feel how hard I can punch?
Where are you, you spongy, yellow, delicious bastards?
Are you one of these guys that tries to one-up everybody else's story?
No. I knew a guy way worse at that than me.
You see, He was in the ass-kicking business and...
... business is *good*!
Bill Murray, you're a zombie?
Ow, I'm on fire! Ouch!
You're not a zombie, you're talking and... You're okay?
The hell I am.
I'm sorry. I didn't know it was... It was ""you"" you.
Are you...? What's with the get-up?
Oh, I do it to blend in. You know. Zombies don't mess with other zombies. Buddy of mine, makeup guy, he showed me how to do this. Corn starch. You know, some berries, a little licorice for the ladies. Suits my lifestyle, you know. I like to get out and do stuff. Just played nine holes on the Riviera. Just walked on. Nobody there.
You are staring at me. It's a hairpiece! It's a piece.
It's - I'm sorry. No, it's just that you look remarkably like Eddie Van Halen.
I just saw Eddie Van Halen.
Nuh-uh.
Really?
Yeah.
Wow.
Where?
The Hollywood Bowl.
And how was he?
He's a zombie.
Aw. Tough break.
Here's the deal: I'm not easy to get along with, and I'm sensing you're a bit of a bitch.
My mama always told me someday I'd be good at something. Who'd a guessed that something'd be zombie-killing?
Probably nobody.
Hey, for fuck's sake, enough already! We are being chased by ravenous freaks. Like we don't have enough problems. Oh, they stole my hummer. Oh, we have trust issues. Well get over it! We can't just fucking drive down the road playing I Spy or some shit for two hours like four normal-ass Americans? Fuck me.
Whoa.
I know.
Ooh! Free parking...
Yeah.
-which coincidentally is the best thing about Zombieland.
You want to know the best thing about Z-land? No- no Facebook status updates. You know, Rob Curtis is gearing up for Friday. Who cares?
The best thing is no more flushing. Epic.
You can do anything you want to a man, but do not fuck with his Cadillac!
Where are the fucking Twinkies?
What do you think? ""Zombie Kill of the Week""?
There's a box of Twinkies in that grocery store. Not just any box of Twinkies, the last box of Twinkies that anyone will enjoy in the whole universe. Believe it or not, Twinkies have an expiration date. Some day very soon, Life's little Twinkie gauge is gonna go... empty.
Hey, a little help with movin' the couch. We're makin' a fort.
Come on! Anybody hungry? Tallahassee's nice this time of year!
Have you ever read that book ""She's Just Not That Into You""?
Wow, these fellas really let themselves go.
And they're so fat.
...The day he was born I just lost my mind.
Thank God for rednecks!
You've got a pretty mouth.
Hop in the car, Evel Knievel. Let's go ride the rollercoaster.
In Mexico, you know what they call Twinkies? ""Los submarinos.""
You see, that why i don't let people close, you only get burned.
Thank God for rednecks!
B-holes... Jokes on them. Look what I swiped from under the seat.
Hey... This bag ain't gonna carry itself..."
Bruce Wayne,AO,Heartbroken Badass,"You do not fear death. You think this makes you strong. It makes you weak.
Why?
How can you move faster than possible, fight longer than possible without the most powerful impulse of the spirit: the fear of death.
I do fear death. I fear dying in here, while my city burns, and there's no one there to save it.
Then make the climb.
How?
As the child did. Without the rope. Then fear will find you again.
Why didn't you just... kill me?
You don't fear death... You welcome it. Your punishment must be more severe.
Torture?
Yes. But not of your body... Of your soul.
Where am I?
Home, where I learned the truth about despair, as will you. There's a reason why this prison is the worst hell on earth... Hope. Every man who has ventured here over the centuries has looked up to the light and imagined climbing to freedom. So easy... So simple... And like shipwrecked men turning to sea water from uncontrollable thirst, many have died trying. I learned here that there can be no true despair without hope. So, as I terrorize Gotham, I will feed its people hope to poison their souls. I will let them believe they can survive so that you can watch them clamoring over each other to ""stay in the sun."" You can watch me torture an entire city and when you have truly understood the depth of your failure, we will fulfill Ra's al Ghul's destiny... We will destroy Gotham and then, when it is done and Gotham is ashes, then you have my permission to die
There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne. You and your friends better batten down the hatches, because when it hits, you're all gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little for the rest of us.
You sound like you're looking forward to it.
I'm adaptable.
Deshi basara! Deshi basara!
What does that mean?
Rise.
I watched you die.
I told you I was immortal.
Must've lost my ticket.
Your wife said you were taking a cab home.
My wife?
This conversation used to end with an unusual request.
I'm retired.
Well let me show you some stuff anyway. Just for old time's sake.
I've seen worse cartilage in knees.
That's good.
No, that's because there is NO cartilage in your knee, and not much of any use in your elbows or your shoulders. Between that and the scar tissue on your kidneys, the residual concussive damage to your brain tissue, and the general scarred-over quality of your body, I cannot recommend that you go heliskiing, Mr. Wayne
Right.
Mind if I cut in?
Oh, you don't seem happy to see me.
You were supposed to be a shut-in.
I felt like some fresh air.
Why didn't you call the police?
I have a powerful friend who deals with things like this.
That's a brazen costume for a cat burglar.
Yeah? Who are you pretending to be?
Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire. Who's your date?
His wife's in Ibiza. She left her diamonds behind, though. Worried they might get stolen.
Mm. It's pronounced Ibeetha. You wouldn't want any of these folks realizing you're a crook, not a social climber.
You think I care what anyone in this room thinks of me?
I doubt you care what anyone in any room thinks of you.
Don't condescend, Mr. Wayne. You don't know a thing about me.
Well, Selina Kyle, I know you came here from your walk-up in Old Town, a modest place for a master jewel thief. Which means that either you're saving for retirement, or you're in deep with the wrong people.
You don't get to judge me just because you were born in the master bedroom of Wayne Manor.
Actually, I was born in the Regency Room.
I started out doing what I had to. Once you've done what you had to, they'll never let you do what you want to.
Start fresh.
There's no fresh start in today's world. Any twelve-year-old with a cell phone could find out what you did. Everything we do is collated and quantified. Everything sticks.
Is that how you justify stealing?
I take what I need to from those who have more than enough. I don't stand on the shoulders of people with less.
Robin Hood?
I think I do more to help someone than most of the people in this room. Than you.
I think maybe you're assuming a little too much.
Maybe you're being unrealistic about what's really in your pants other than your wallet.
Ouch.
You steal from us, you little bastard?
You boys know you can't come into my neighborhood without asking politely.
Never steal anything from someone you can't outrun, kid.
Pretty generous, for a thief.
I thought they killed you.
Not yet.
If you're expecting an apology...
It wouldn't suit you.
We were in this together, and then you were gone.
The Batman wasn't needed anymore. We won.
Based on a lie. Now this evil... rises from where we tried to bury it. The Batman has to come back.
What if he doesn't exist any more?
He must... he must...
I'm not afraid. I'm angry.
I need you to get me back in the game.
Bruce Wayne at a charity ball?
Miss Tate, isn't it?
Even before you became a recluse, you never came to these things.
Proceeds go to the big fat spread. It's not about charity, it's about feeding the ego of whichever society hag laid this on.
Actually, this is my party, Mr. Wayne.
Oh.
And the proceeds will go where they should, because I paid for the big fat spread myself.
That's very generous of you.
You have to invest to restore balance to the world. Take our clean-energy project.
Sometimes the investment doesn't pay off. I'm sorry.
You have a practiced apathy, Mr. Wayne. But a man who doesn't care about the world doesn't spend half his fortune on a plan to save it. And isn't so wounded when it fails that he goes into hiding. Have a good evening, Mr. Wayne.
Is it really painful?
Well, you're welcome to try it, Alfred.
Happy watching, thank you, sir.
You brought me out here to show me this, Mr. Fox?
Bear with me, Miss Tate.
Please keep hands and feet inside the car at all times.
This is it, isn't it?
The reactor is beneath the river so it could be instantly flooded in the event of a security breach.
Is Bruce Wayne really that paranoid?
I'm gonna plead the fifth on that one.
I thought you might like to see what your investment built.
No fossil fuels. Free, clean energy for an entire city. Three years ago, a Russian scientist published a paper on weaponized fusion reactions. One week later your reactor started developing problems. I think this machine works.
Miranda, if it were operational, the danger to Gotham would be too great.
Would it make you feel better to know that the Russian scientist died in a plane crash six months ago?
Someone will work out what Dr. Pavel did. Someone will figure out a way to make this power source into a nuclear weapon. I need you to take control of Wayne Enterprises and this reactor.
To do what with it?
Nothing. Until we can guarantee its safety.
And if we can't?
Decommission it and flood it.
Destroy the world's best chance for a sustainable future?
If the world's not ready, yes.
Bruce, if you want to save the world you have to start trusting it.
I'm trusting you.
Doesn't count. You have no choice.
I could have flooded this chamber any time in the last three years. I'm choosing to trust you. Please.
This city needs me.
I'll get this to Mr. Fox, but no more. I've sewn you up, I've set your bones, but I won't bury you. I've buried enough members of the Wayne family.
You'll leave me?
You see only one end to your journey. Leaving is all I have to make you understand, you're not Batman anymore. You have to find another way. You used to talk about finishing a life beyond that awful cape.
Rachel died believing that we would be together; that was my life beyond the cape. I can't just move on. She didn't, she couldn't.
What if she had? What if, before she died, she wrote a letter saying she chose Harvey Dent over you? And what if, to spare your pain, I burnt that letter?
How dare you use Rachel to try to stop me?
I am using the truth, Master Wayne. Maybe it's time we all stop trying to outsmart the truth and let it have its day. I'm sorry.
You're sorry? You expect to destroy my world and then think we're going to shake hands?
No... no, I know what this means.
What does it mean?
It means your hatred... and it also means losing someone that I have cared for since I first heard his cries echo through this house. But it might also mean saving your life. And that is more important.
Goodbye, Alfred.
You two should exchange notes over coffee.
So now you're trying to set me up with a jewel thief?
At this point, I'd set you up with a chimpanzee if it'd brought you back to the world!
There's nothing out there for me.
And that's the problem. You hung up your cape and your cowl, but you didn't move on, you never went to find a life, to find someone...
Alfred... I did find someone.
I know, and you lost her. But that's all part of living, sir. But you're not living. You're just waiting, hoping for things to go bad again.
If this man is everything that you say he is, then this city needs me.
This city needs Bruce Wayne, your resources, your knowledge. It doesn't need your body, or your life. That time has passed.
You're afraid that if I go back out there I'll fail.
No. I'm afraid that you want to.
If you're seriously considering going back out there, you should hear the rumors surrounding Bane.
I'm all ears.
There is a prison in a more ancient part of the world, a pit where men are thrown to suffer and die. But sometimes a man rises from the darkness. Sometimes the pit sends something back.
Bane.
Right. Born and raised in hell on earth.
Born in prison?
No one knows why or how he escaped, but they do know that once he did he was trained by Ra's Al Ghul, your mentor.
Bane was a member of The League of Shadows.
And then he was excommunicated. And any man who is too extreme for Ra's Al Ghul is not to be trifled with."
George Kittredge,BH,Self Made Man,"But a man expects his wife to...
Behave herself. Naturally.
To behave herself naturally.
Sorry.
You're like some marvelous, distant, well, queen, I guess. You're so cool and fine and always so much your own. There's a kind of beautiful purity about you, Tracy, like, like a statue.
George...
Oh, it's grand, Tracy. It's what everybody feels about you. It's what I first worshipped you for from afar.
I don't want to be worshipped. I want to be loved.
Well, I suppose I should object to this twosome.
That would be most objectionable.
I'm going to build you an ivory tower with my own two hands.
Like fun you are.
You keep out of this.
You forget I am out of it.
What's the matter, Bessie? You seem worried.
Maybe that's because his name is Jack.
Then you don't know women.
That's possible.
...and you're a fool.
...and that's quite possibe."
Roger Callaway,BH,Self Made Man,"Do you think maybe my daughter's asking for a little attention?
I'd say she's demanding it.
Hmm.
Sorry to ruin your wedding. I just didn't want the wrong girl going down the aisle. I mean the wrong flower girl.
I think you had it right the first time.
I made my money the old-fashioned way - pure dumb luck.
Told ya. Third time's a charm...
Wait. All of this? This was *your* doing?
Oh, it *was*, was it?
Well, girls, what do you have to say for yourselves?
, :
So kiss already!
, :
So kiss already!
I don't know what's more bruised, my butt or my ego.
Clarice! Your hair! I mean you're here!
Vincenzo, did you ever hit a home run?
Not recently.
You know the feeling when it's the bottom of the ninth, the bases are loaded, and you know the next one's coming right down the middle. And then, you just connect... and for an instant, you know that it's going over the fence and out of the park... and further than you could ever imagine.
Yeah, that's a great feeling.
Yeah.
Clarice hates baseball."
"Daniel ""Rudy"" Ruettiger",BH,Self Made Man,"This is the most beautiful sight these eyes have ever seen!
My son's going to Notre Dame!
You're a Ruettiger! There's nothing in the world wrong with being a Ruettiger!"
Dick Jones,R,Corrupt Corporate Executive,"Please put down your weapon. You have twenty seconds to comply.
I think you'd better do what he says, Mr. Kinney.
You now have fifteen seconds to comply.
You are in direct violation of Penal Code 1.13, Section 9.
You have five seconds to comply.
Help...! Help me!
Four... three... two... one... I am now authorized to use physical force!
What the fuck are you doing? Do you know who I am? If you think you're gonna get away with this, you got another thing... Ahh!
Goddammit!
Stop! I'll give you anything you want! Just please, please don't kill me, all right?
Hello, buddy boy. Dick Jones here. I guess you're on your knees right about now, begging for your life. Pathetic. You don't feel so cocky now, do ya, Bob?
Whatever he's paying you, I'll double it right now.
You know what the tragedy is here, Bob? We could have been friends...
...but you wouldn't go through proper channels.
You went over my head. That hurt...
...but life goes on, it's an old story, the fight for love and glory, huh, Bob? It helps if you think of it as a game, Bob. Every game has a winner and a loser.
I'm cashing you out, Bob.
Hey, Dickey boy. How's tricks?
That *thing* is still alive.
I don't know what you're talking about.
The police officer who arrested you, the one you spilled your guts to.
Hey... take a look at my face, *Dick*! He was trying to kill me.
He's a cyborg, you idiot! He recorded every word you said. His memory's admissible as evidence! You *involved* me! You're gonna have to kill it.
Well, listen, chief... your company built the fucking thing! Now I gotta deal with it? I don't have time for this bullshit!
Suit yourself, Clarence... but Delta City begins construction in two months. That's two million workers living in trailers. That means drugs, gambling, prostitution - virgin territory for the man who knows how to open up new markets. One man could control it all, Clarence.
Well, I guess we're gonna be friends after all... *Richard*.
Destroy it.
Gonna need some major firepower. You got access to military weaponry?
We practically are the military.
Come in, officer. You know, I usually don't see anyone without an appointment, but your case I'll make an exception.
You are under arrest.
Oh? On what charge?
Aiding and abetting a known felon.
Sounds like I'm in a lot of trouble. You better take me in.
I will.
What's the matter officer? I'll tell you what's the matter. It's a little insurance policy called ""Directive 4"", my little contribution to your psychological profile. Any attempt to arrest a senior officer of OCP results in shutdown. What did you think? That you were an ordinary police officer? You're our product, and we can't very well have our products turning against us, can we?
Ahh, still a little fight left in you. Maybe you'd like to meet a friend of mine.
I had to kill Bob Morton because he made a mistake. Now it's time to erase that mistake.
How can we help you, officer?
Dick Jones is wanted for murder.
This is absurd! That thing... is a violent mechanical psychopath!
My program will not allow me to act against an officer of this company.
These are serious charges. What is your evidence?
I had to kill Bob Morton because he made a mistake. Now it's time to erase that mistake. I had to kill Bob Morton because he made a mistake. Now it's time to erase that mistake.
Get up! Get up! I want a chopper, now! We will walk to the roof very calmly, I will board the chopper with my hostage. Anybody tries to stop me... the old geezer gets it.
Dick, you're fired!
Thank you.
Every policeman knows when he joins the force that there are certain inherent risks that come with the territory. Ask any cop, he'll tell ya, ""If you can't stand the heat, you better stay out of the kitchen.""
Congratulations, Bob.
Thanks.
I remember when I was a young executive for this company. I used to call the old man funny names - Iron Butt, Boner... once I even called him... Asshole - but there was always respect. I always knew where the line was drawn, and you just stepped over it, buddy-boy. You've insulted me and you've insulted this company with that bastard creation of yours. I had a guaranteed military sale with ED 209 - renovation program, spare parts for twenty-five years... Who cares if it worked or not?
The old man thought it was pretty important... Dick.
You know, he's a sweet old man, and he means well, but he's not gonna live forever and I'm number two around here. Pretty simple math, huh, Bob? You just, uh...
... fucked with the wrong guy.
You're out of your fuckin' mind!
You'd better pray that that unholy monster of yours doesn't screw up.
Dick, I'm very disappointed.
I'm sure it's only a glitch, a temporary setback.
You call this a GLITCH?
We're scheduled to begin construction in six months. Your ""temporary setback"" could cost us fifty million dollars in interest payments alone!
I say good business is where you find it.
Jesus, you really screwed up.
Because no matter what happens, this corporation will live up to the guiding principles of its founder: courage, strength, conviction.
We will meet each new challenge with the same aggressive attitude."
Cutler Beckett,R,Corrupt Corporate Executive,"No doubt you've discovered that loyalty is no longer the currency of the realm, as your father believes.
Then what is?
I'm afraid currency is the currency of the realm.
I expect, then, that we can come to some sort of understanding. I'm here to negotiate.
I'm listening.
I'm listening intently.
The last of our ships is returned.
Is there any news on the chest?
None. But one of the ships did pick up a man adrift at sea.
He had these.
I took the liberty of filling in my name.
If you intend to claim these, then you must have something to trade. Do you have the Compass?
Better.
The heart of Davey Jones.
Perhaps you remember a certain pirate named Jack Sparrow.
, :
*Captain!*
, :
*Captain!*
*Captain* Jack Sparrow.
You have no reason and no authority to arrest this man!
In fact I do. Here is the warrant for the arrest of one William Turner.
...This warrant is for Elizabeth Swann!
Oh, is it? That's annoying. My mistake, arrest her too.
I care not for cursed Aztec gold. My desires are not so provincial. There's more than one chest of value in these waters. So perhaps you may wish to enhance your offer.
Consider in your calculations that you robbed me of my wedding night.
The East India Trading Company has need of your services. We wish for you to act as our agent in a business transaction with our mutual friend Captain Sparrow.
More acquaintance than friend. How do you know him?
We've had dealings in the past. And we've each left out mark on each other.
What mark did he leave on you?
By your efforts, Jack Sparrow was set free. I would like you to go to him and recover a certain property in his position.
Recover? At the point of a sword?
Bargain! You will offer what amounts to a full pardon. Jack will be free. A privateer in the employ of England.
Somehow I doubt Jack will consider employment the same as being free.
Freedom! Jack Sparrow is a dying breed. The world is shrinking. The blank edges of the map filled in. Jack must find his place in the new world or perish.
A marriage interrupted... or fate intervenes?
Every man has a price he will willingly accept, even for what he hoped never to sell.
You're mad.
Thank goodness for that, 'cause if I wasn't this would probably never work.
And that was without even a single drop of rum.
Done?
Done. Although if I kill you, then I can use the compass to find my way to Shipwreck Cove.
Cut out the middle man, as it were.
Without me, you'd arrive at the Cove and find it a fortress, nigh-impregnable, able to withstand a blockade for years. Then you'll be wishing ""Oh, if only there was someone I hadn't killed inside, to make sure the pirates come OUTside...""
And you can do this?
You may kill me, but you can never insult me. Who am I?
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow!
Jack, I just remembered... I have this magic compass that points to whatever I want. So what do I need YOU for?
It points to the thing you want the most, and that is NOT Shipwreck Cove.
Then what is, Jack?
Me... dead.
Advise your brethren. You can fight, and all of you will die... or you can not fight, in which case only most of you will die.
You murdered my father.
He chose his own fate.
And you have chosen yours. We will fight. And you will die.
Which ship do we follow?
Signal the Dutchman to track down Sao Feng. We follow the Pearl. How soon can we have the ship ready to pursue?
Do you think he plans it all out, or just makes it up as he goes along?
Curious. Your friends appear to be quite desperate, Jack. Perhaps they no longer believe that a gathering of squabbling pirates can defeat the Flying Dutchman. And so despair leads to betrayal. And you and I are no strangers to betrayal, are we, Jack?
It's not here, Jack.
What? What isn't?
The Heart of Davy Jones is safely aboard the Dutchman, and so unavailable for use as leverage to satisfy your debt to the good Captain.
By my reckoning, that debt has been settled.
By your death... yet here you are.
Close your eyes and pretend it's all a bad dream. That's how I get by.
I propose an exchange. Will leaves with us. And you can take Jack.
Done.
Undone.
Done.
Jack's one of the nine pirate lords. You have no right!
King!
... and then you can take care of Barbossa and Turner, specially Turner. The rest go aboard with me to Shipwreck Cove, where I will hand you over the pirates and you will NOT hand me over to Jones.
And what becomes of Miss Swann?
What interest is she to you?
I cannot be summoned like some mongrel pup!
Apparently, you can.
You be the cur that led these wolves to our door?
Don't blame Turner, he was merely the tool of your betrayal. If you wish to see its grand architect, look to your left.
My hands are clean in this, figuratively.
My actions were my own and to my own purpose. Jack had nothing to do with it.
Well spoke, listen to the tool!
The brethren know they face extinction. All that remains is where they make their final stand.
What about the Governor? He's been asking questions about the heart.
Does he know?

Then... perhaps his usefulness has run its course.
We have a favorable wind, sir.
Oh, so we do. Signal Jones to give no quarter. That should brighten his day.
What is he waiting for?
He actually expects us to honor our agreement. Nothing personal, Jack... it's just good business.
GO, all of you! And take that infernal thing with you. I will not have it on my ship.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, because *I* will. Because it seems to be the only way to ensure listening ears. We need prisoners to interrogate, which seems to work best when they're alive.
The Dutchman sails as its captain commands.
And its captain is to sail it as COMMANDED! I thought you would have learned that, after I ordered you to kill your pet. This is no longer your world, Jones. The immaterial has become... immaterial.
Jack Sparrow sends his regards.
Sparrow?
You didn't tell him? We rescued Jack from the Locker, along with the Black Pearl.
What else have you not told me?
There is an issue far more troublesome... I believe you are familiar with a person called Calypso.
Not a person, a heathen god. One who delights in cursing men with their wildest dreams, and revealing them to be hollow and naught but ash! The world is well rid of her.
Not quite so well, actually. The Brethren Court intends to release her.
NO! THEY CANNOT! The first Brethren Court promised to imprison her forever. That was our agreement!
Your agreement?
I showed them how to bind her. She could not be trusted... I, she gave me no choice! We must act before she is released!
You loved her. She's the one, and then you betrayed her.
She PRETENDED to love me! SHE betrayed ME!
And after which betrayal did you cut your heart out, I wonder?
So what are you proposing?
A new deal. One that requires absolutely nothing from you, but information.
Were I in a divulgatory mood, what were I to divulge?
Everything. Where are they meeting? What are they planning? What is the purpose of the nine pieces of eight?
Ah, she survived.
Ready on the guns!
Bloody hell, there's nothing left.
Jones is a loose cannon, sir.
The enemy has opted for oblivion! Prepare the fleet.
A piece of eight. Nine of them, you say?
Yes, sir. Our contact in Singapore was certain about it: ""Nine pieces of eight.""
What's the significance of that, I wonder?
Does it matter? There's nothing that can hold against the Armada, not with the Flying Dutchman at the lead.
Nothing we *know* of... Did your contact happen to mention where the Brethren are meeting?
He was mum on that, sir.
Then he knows the value of information... Better keep this between ourselves. We don't want anyone running off to Singapore, now do we?"
Max Zorin,R,Corrupt Corporate Executive,"You slept well?
A little restless but I got off eventually.
What have they done?
You discharged her, so she and her accomplice came here to kill you. Then they set fire to the office, to conceal the crime but they were trapped in the elevator and perished in the flames.
But that means I would have to be...
Dead!
That's rather neat, Don't you think?
Brilliant. I'm almost speechless with admiration.
Intuitive improvisation is the secret of genius.
Herr Doktor Mortner would be proud of his creation.
Wow! What a view!
To a KILL!
More. More power. More. Do it!
My department knows I'm here. When I don't report they'll retaliate.
If you're the best they've got, they're more likely to try and cover up your embarrassing incompetence.
Don't count on it, Zorin.
Ha ha, you amuse me, Mr. Bond.
It's not mutual.
So, anyone else want to drop out?
It's time to flood the fault.
But May Day and my men!
Yes. A convenient coincidence.
Mr. Zorin, those men are LOYAL to you!
Gentlemen, for centuries alchemists tried to make gold from base metals. Today, we make microchips from sillicon, which is common sand; but far better than gold. Now, for several years, we had a profitable partnership, you as manufacturers, while I acquired and passed on to you industrial information that made you competitive, succesful. We are now in the unique position to form an international cartel to control not only production, but distribution of these microchips. There is one obstacle - Sillicon Valley in San Francisco. Over 250 plants, employing thousands of scientists, technicians. This is the heartland of electronic production in the United States - which accounts for, what, 80% - of the world microchip market. I propose to - *end* - the domination of Silicon Valley and leave us in control of that market.
You lost, 007.
Killing Tibbett was a mistake.
Then I'm about to make that same mistake twice.
And what if I'm thrown?
Then you lose.
I take it you ride.
I'm happiest in the saddle.
A fellow sportsman. So, what about fishing? Fly-casting?
I'm neglecting my other guests. Enjoy yourself, you'll find the young ladies stimulating company.
This will hurt him more than me."
Carter Burke,"S, R","Coward, Corrupt Corporate Executive","Well, that's great. That's just fuckin' great, man! Now what the fuck are we supposed to do? We're in some real pretty shit now, man!
Are you finished?
I guess we're not gonna be leaving now, right?
I'm sorry, Newt.
You don't have to be sorry. It wasn't your fault.
That's it, man. Game over, man. Game over! What the fuck are we gonna do now? What are we gonna do?
Maybe we can build a fire, sing a couple of songs, huh? Why don't we try that?
We'd better get back 'cause it'll be dark soon and they mostly come at night. Mostly.
Look, those two specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division. Now, if you're smart, we can both come out of it as heroes and we'll be set up for life.
You're crazy Burke, you know that? You really think that you can get a dangerous organism like that past ICC quarantine?
How can they impound it if they don't know about it?
Oh, they *will* know about it, Burke, from me. Just like they'll know that you were responsible for the deaths of 158 colonists here.
Wait a second...
You sent them to that ship.
You're wrong.
I just checked the colony log. Dated 0-6-1-2-7-9, signed Burke, Carter J. You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them. Why didn't you warn them, Burke?
Okay, look. What if that ship didn't even exist, huh? Did you ever think about that? I didn't know! So now, if I went in and made a major security issue out of it, everybody steps in. Administration steps in, and there are no exclusive rights for anybody; nobody wins. So I made a decision and it was... wrong. It was a bad call, Ripley. It was a bad call.
Bad call?
These people are *dead*, Burke! Don't you have any idea what you have done here? Well, I'm gonna make sure they nail you right to the wall for this! You're not gonna sleaze your way out of this one! Right to the wall!
Ripley...! You know, I... I expected more from you. I thought you'd be smarter than this.
I'm happy to disappoint you.
I thought you never missed, Bishop.
You never said anything about an android being on board! Why not?
Pff, it never... never occurred to me. It's just common practice. We always have a synthetic on board.
I prefer the term ""Artificial Person"" myself.
I say we grease this rat-fuck son-of-a-bitch right now.
It just doesn't make any goddamn sense.
He figured that he could get an alien back through quarantine, if one of us was... impregnated... whatever you call it, and then frozen for the trip home. Nobody would know about the embryos we were carrying... me and Newt.
Wait a minute, now... we'd all know.
Yes. The only way he could do it is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the way home... namely, yours. Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.
Fuck. He's dead. You're dog-meat, pal!
This is so nuts. I mean, listen - listen to what you're saying. It's paranoid delusion. How - It's really sad. It's pathetic.
You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse. You don't see them fucking each other over for a goddamn percentage.
All right, we waste him. No offense.
No. He's gotta go back.
Is there a problem?
I'm sorry. I don't know why I didn't even... Ripley's last trip out, the syn- the artificial person malfunctioned.
""Malfunctioned""?
There were problems and a-a few deaths were involved.
I'm shocked. Was it an older model?
Yeah, the Hyperdine System's 120-A2.
Well, that explains it then. The A2s always were a bit twitchy. That could never happen now with our behavioral inhibitors. It is impossible for me to harm or by omission of action, allow to be harmed, a human being.
All right. We got seven canisters of CM-20. I say we roll them in there and nerve gas the whole fuckin' nest.
It's worth the try, but we don't know if that's gonna affect them.
Look let's just bug out and call it even, okay? What are we even talking about this for?
I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit. It's the only way to be sure.
Fuckin' A!
Hold on, hold on just a second. This installation has a substantial dollar value attached to it.
They can *bill* me.
Okay, I know this is an emotional moment for all of us, okay? I know that. But let's not make snap judgments, please. This is clearly... clearly an important species we're dealing with and I don't think that you or I, or *anybody*, has the right to arbitrarily exterminate them.
Wrong.
Yeah. Watch us.
Hey, maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got our asses kicked, pal!
Look. I'm not blind to what's going on, but I cannot authorize that kind of action. I'm sorry.
Well, I believe that Corporal Hicks... has authority here.
*Corporal* Hicks has...
This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command. Am I right, Corporal?
Yeah... yeah, that's right.
Yeah... Look, Ripley, this is a multi-million dollar installation, okay? He can't make that kind of decision. He's just a grunt! Uh, no offense.
None taken.
Ferro, do you copy?
Standing by.
Prepare for dust-off. We're gonna need immediate evac.
Roger. On our way.
I say we take off, nuke the site from orbit.
It's the only way to be sure.
Lieutenant, what do those pulse rifles fire?
10 millimeter explosive tip caseless. Standard light armor piercing rounds. Why?
Well, look where your team is. They're right under the primary heat exchangers.
So?
So, if they fire their weapons in there, won't they rupture the cooling system?
Ho, ho, ho. Yeah, she's absolutely right.
So? So what?
Look, this whole station is basically a big fusion reactor, right? So you're talkin' about a thermonuclear explosion and adiós, muchachos.
Oh, great. Wonderful. Shit!
I'm Burke. Carter Burke. I work for the company. But don't let that fool you, I'm really an okay guy. I'm glad to see you're feeling a little better. They, uh, they tell me that all the weakness and disorientation should pass soon. It's just natural side effects of such an unusually long hypersleep, or something like that.
What do you mean? How long was I out there?
Has no one discussed this with you yet?
No. But, I mean, I don't... recognize this place.
No, I know. Uh, okay, it's just that, uh, this might be a shock to you. It's long...
*How* long? Please.
Fifty-seven years.
What?
That's the thing. You were out there for fifty-seven years. What happened was, you had drifted right through the core systems, and it's really just blind luck that a deep salvage team found you when they did. It's one in a thousand, really. I think you're damn lucky to be alive, kiddo. You could be floating out there forever.
Just tell me one thing, Burke. You're going out there to destroy them, right? Not to study. Not to bring back. But to wipe them out.
That's the plan. You have my word on it.
All right, I'm in.
Busy little creatures, huh?
I don't believe this. You guys throw me at the wolves, and now you want me to go back out there? Forget it. It's not my problem.
Can I finish ?
No. There's no way.
Ripley, you wouldn't be going in with the troops. I can guarantee your safety.
These colonials marines are very though hombres. They're packing state of the art firepower. There's nothing they can't handle. Lieutenant, am I right ?
That's true. We've been trained to deal with situations like this.
Do you have any news about my daughter ?
Well we did come up with some informations. Why don't we sit down. I was hoping to wait until after the inquest... Amanda Ripley-McClaren - married name, I guess - aged 66. And that was the time of her death. Which was two years ago. I'm really sorry.
Amy...
Um... She was cremated and interred at Westlake Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin. No children. I checked.
I'd promised her... that I'll be home for her birthday, Her 11th birthday.
How are we today ?
Terrible
Well, better than yesterday at least
Where am I ?
You're Safe. You're at Gateway Station, been here a couple of days. You were pretty groggy at first, but now you're OK. Looks like you've got a visitor.
Jonesy. Come here! Hey, come here. How are you, you stupid cat? How are you ? Were have you been ?
I guess you two have met, huh . I'm Burke. Carter Burke. I work for the company. But don't let that fool you. I'm really an OK guy. I'm glad to see that you're feeling a little bit better. They told me that all the weakness and desorientation should pass soon. It's just natural side effects of such an unusally long hypersleep, or something like that...
What'd you mean, How long was I out there ?
Has no one discussed this with you yet ?
No. But, I mean, I don't recognise this place.
No, I know. Uh... OK. It's just that, uh, this might be a shock to you. It's longer...
How Long ? Please.
57 years.
What?
That's the thing. You're out there for 57 years. What happened is. You had drifted right through the core system, and It's really just blind luck that a deep-salvage team found you when they did. It was one in a thousand, really. I think you're damn lucky to be alive, kiddo. You could be floating out there forever.

Noah Cross,R,Corrupt Corporate Executive,"'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings, and whores all get respectable if they last long enough.
How much are you worth?
I have no idea. How much do you want?
I just wanna know what you're worth. More than 10 million?
Oh my, yes!
Why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What could you buy that you can't already afford?
The future, Mr. Gittes! The future. Now, where's the girl? I want the only daughter I've got left. As you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
Who do you blame for that? Her?
I don't blame myself. You see, Mr. Gittes, most people never have to face the fact that at the right time and the right place, they're capable of ANYTHING.
You may think you know what you're dealing with, but, believe me, you don't.
Why is that funny?
That's what the District Attorney used to tell me in Chinatown.
Katherine! I, I'm your grandfather, my dear. I'm your grandfather.
Katherine, get in the car.
Go on. No no, go on.
I'll follow you.
Get away from her! Get away.
Evelyn, please, please be reasonable.
Come to my...
Get AWAY from her!
Evelyn! How many years have I got? She's mine, too.
She's never going to know that.
You've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like that.
Well, Mr. Gittes, you don't look too much the worse for wear, I must say! Now where's the girl?
I've got her.
Is she all right?
She's fine.
Well, where is she?
With her mother.
Either you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water.

Wesley, did you know that in ancient times they would cut the tongue out of their bodyguards their first day on the job? You think that's awful, don't you? You don't like that... I do.
You killed the only two people I ever loved. Why?
Business. That's all it ever is, is business. I was working for Fallon at the time, your father was supposed to throw a fight. And your girl was in the wrong family at the wrong time. It's all business... and you've been in my business for too long!
I don't understand.
I'm not the bad guy.
It's a shame you came here wounded. I would've loved to fight you in your prime. They call you the Man Without Fear. If that's true, why are you afraid to show your face?

Okay, nobody move! All right, you weasels, grab some sky or I let the judge have it. You heard me, I said drop it!
Roger, darling!
That's right, my dear. I'd love to embrace you, but first, I have to satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
Put that gun down, you buck-toothed fool!
That's it, Doom. Give me another excuse to pump you full of lead. So you thought you could get away with it, didn't you? Ha! We toons may act idiotic, but we're not stupid. We demand justice. Why, the real meaning of the word probably hits you like a ton of bricks.
Roger! Roger, say something!
Look, stars! Ready when you are, Raoul.
Can you guess what this is?
Oh my God, it's DIP!
That's right, my dear! Enough to dip Toon Town off the face of the earth!
Vehicle of my own design; 5,000 gallons of heated dip, pumped at enormous velocity through a pressurized water cannon. Toon Town will be erased in a matter of minutes.
A few weeks ago I had the good providence to stumble upon a plan of the city council. A construction plan of epic proportions. We're calling it a freeway.
Freeway? What the hell's a freeway?
Eight lanes of shimmering cement running from here to Pasadena. Smooth, safe, fast. Traffic jams will be a thing of the past.
Shave, and a haircut...
TWO BITS!
Hey, I seen a rabbit.
Ya see?
Where?
He's right here in the bar.
Say hello... Harvey.
I told you so.
So that's why you killed Acme and Maroon? For this freeway? I don't get it.
Of course not. You lack vision, but I see a place where people get on and off the freeway. On and off, off and on all day, all night. Soon, where Toon Town once stood will be a string of gas stations, inexpensive motels, restaurants that serve rapidly prepared food. Tire salons, automobile dealerships and wonderful, wonderful billboards reaching as far as the eye can see. My God, it'll be beautiful.
What's that?
Remember how they always thought there wasn't a way to kill a toon? Well, Doom found a way. Turpentine, acetone, benzene. He calls it ""The Dip.""
I'll catch the rabbit, Mr. Valiant. And I'll try him, convict him, and execute him.
Geez.
That's one dead shoe, eh, boss?
They're not kid gloves, Mr. Valiant. This is how we handle things down in Toontown. I would think you of all people would appreciate that.
Valiant.
I always knew I'd get it in Toontown.
Behind you!
Drop it, lady!
I just saved your life, and you still don't trust me?
I don't trust anybody or anything!
Not even your own eyes?
That's the gun that killed R.K. Maroon, and Doom pulled the trigger.
Doom?
I tracked him to the studio, but I was too late to stop him.
That's right! You'll never stop me! You're dead! You're both dead!
Doom!
Which way did he go?
I don't know. He went thataway.
Let's go.
Dum-dums.
Is this man removing evidence from the scene of the crime?
Ah, no, Judge Doom. Valiant here was just picking it up for you. Weren't you, Eddie?
Hand it over.
Sure.
Their number one seller.
I see working for a toon has rubbed off on you.
I wasn't working for a toon. I was working for R.K. Maroon.
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon. He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures. The rabbit said one way or another he and his wife were going to be happy. Is that true?
Bah! What do I look like? A stenographer?
Shut your yap, Eddie. The man's a judge.
That's all right, Lieutenant. From the smell of him, I'd say it was the booze talking.
You wouldn't have any idea where the rabbit might be, Mr. Valiant?
Have you tried Walla Walla? Cucamonga? I hear Kokomo's very nice this time of the year.
I'm surprised you're not more cooperative, Mr. Valiant. A human has been murdered by a toon. Don't you appreciate the magnitude of that?
Since I've had Toontown under my jurisdiction my goal has been to reign in the insanity, and the only way to do that is to make Toons respect...
... the law.
You see, Mr. Valiant, the successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist in Toontown. I'm retiring, taking a new role in the private sector.
That wouldn't be Cloverleaf Industries, by any chance?
You're looking at the sole stockholder.
Say, Judge. You want we should disresemble the place?
No, Sergeant. Disassembling the place won't be necessary. The rabbit is going to come right to me.
No toon can resist the old Shave-and-a-Haircut trick.
I'm looking for a murderer. A rabbit. A toon rabbit...
about YEEEEAAAA... big.
Well look, there's no Rabbit here. So don't come in here harrassing my customers.
I didn't come here to harrass. I came here to reward.
Hey Judge, what should we do with the wallflower?
We'll settle with him later. Right now, I feel like dispensing some justice. Bring me some dip.
""Merry-Go-Round Broke Down"". What a looney selection for a group of drunken reprobates.
HE'S HERE!
Stop that laughing!
Have you forgotten what happened last time? If you don't stop that laughing, you're going to end up dead just like your idiot hyena cousins!
Have they got the will or not?
Nah, just a stupid love letter.
No matter. I doubt the will'll show up in the next fifteen minutes, anyway.
What happens in the next fifteen minutes?
Toontown will be legally mine, lock, stock and barrel.
What an unfortunate accident. Nothing more treacherous than a slippery road, especially when driving in a maniacal toon vehicle.
I suppose you think no one's going to notice Toontown's disappeared?
Who's got time to wonder what happened to some ridiculous talking mice when they're driving by at 75 miles an hour?
What're you talking about? There's no road past Toontown.
Nobody's gonna drive this lousy freeway when they can take the Red Car for a nickel.
Oh, they'll drive. They'll have to. You see, I bought the Red Car so I could dismantle it.
We searched Valiant boss. The will ain't on him.
Then frisk the woman.
*I'll* handle this one...
Nice booby trap.
Do they have the will or not?
Nah, just a stupid love letter.
No matter. I doubt that will is going to show up in the next fifteen minutes anyway.
What happens in the next fifteen minutes?
Toontown will be legally mine, lock, stock and barrel.
No Toon can resist the old shave-and-a-haircut trick...
We'll handle Mr. Valiant our own way: downtown.
Downtown? Fine. I'll just get a hold of Santino. I'll be more than happy to go downtown.
Oh, I'm not talking about *that* downtown. I'm talking about downtown *Toon*town!
Rummaging around in a lady's dressing room? Tsk, tsk, tsk. What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?
Last week, some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir.
Look, doll, if I'd wanted underwear, I'd have broken into Frederick's of Hollywood. You know damn well I was looking for Marvin Acme's will.
Marvin Acme had no will. I should know; the estate's in my jurisdiction.
Oh, there was a will all right. And she and R.K. Maroon killed him for it.
That's absurd!
Someone else is in here looking for the will, too. Probably Maroon's flunkies.
I would've caught 'em, too, if Cheetah here hadn't have interrupted me!
Hey! I seen a rabbit.
Where?
See?
*Where*?
He's right here in the bar.
Well, say hello... Harvey.
I told ya so.
WAAAAAHHHHHH! YOU CURSED BRAT! LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE! I'M MELTING! MELTING! OH, WHAT A WORLD, WHAT A WORLD! Who ever thought a greatest detective like you could destroy my beautiful wickedness? OH, LOOK OUT! LOOK OUT! I AM GOING!"
Conal Cochran,R,Corrupt Corporate Executive,"Enjoy the horror-thon, Doctor, and don't forget to watch the big giveaway afterwards.
Why, Cochran, why?
Do I need a reason? Mr. Kupfer was right, you know. I do love a good joke, and this is the best ever: a joke on the children. But there's a better reason. You don't really know much about Halloween. You thought no further than the strange custom of having your children wear masks and go out begging for candy.
It was the start of the year in our old Celtic lands, and we'd be waiting in our houses of wattles and clay. The barriers would be down, you see, between the real and the unreal, and the dead might be looking in to sit by our fires of turf.
Halloween... the festival of Samhain! The last great one took place three thousand years ago, when the hills ran red with the blood of animals and children.
Sacrifices.
It was part of our world... our craft.
Witchcraft.
To us, it was a way of controlling our environment. It's not so different now... it's time again. In the end, we don't decide these things, you know; the planets do. They're in alignment, and it's time again. The world's going to change tonight, Doctor, I'm glad you'll be able to watch it. And... Happy Halloween.
I do love a good joke and this is the best ever: a joke on the children.
From an ancient, sacrificial circle... Stonehenge.
Ha ha. We had a TIME getting it here. You wouldn't believe how we did it.
It has a power in it.
It will be morning soon. Halloween morning. A very busy day for me.
Hey Mr. Cochran, just what is the final processing?
Oh I assure you it's just a little bit of this and a little bit of that. Quality inspection, the seal of approval. You know, the usual. And of course, there's a lot of trade secrets.
Oh I'd sure like to take a look.
Aw sorry.
Not even a peek for your best salesman?
Just one little look?
Well you see, part of the final processing involves volatile chemicals. They're very dangerous. I wouldn't want to put anybody in any danger.
Oh sure, I understand.
Aw, Mr. Chaliss.
Where's Ellie?
Mrs. ""Smith""? I'm sure she's resting just now.
Didn't take you long to get here, Mr. Chaliss. DOCTOR Chaliss, I should say.
Those who went before me, you know they-they never dreamed of anything like this.
What is this place?
Can't you tell? A vast... Ancient techology. Ha ha ha, a good magician never explains. Come on, then, you've still got time to figure it out all by yourself.
Trade secrets.
Clumsy.
This was a rare piece. German. Made in Munich, 1785. I must try and get a replacement.
Your friend Ms Guttman...
You killed her!
Oh no, no, no! Ms Guttman was the victim of a misfire. The others...
You know what you really need to see is a demonstration and there's one coming right up.
It's time again. In the end, we don't decide these things you know, the planets do. They're in alignment and it's time again. The world's going to change tonight, Doctor. I'm glad you'll be able to watch it.
The surprising thing is that the internal components were quite simple to produce. The outer features took much longer to perfect but of course in the end it's just another form of mask making.
Bless you. Convincing, aren't they? Loyal, obedient. Unlike most human beings."
Mayor Augustus Maywho,R,Corrupt Corporate Executive,"They nursed you. They clothed you. Here they are! Your old biddies!
Are you two still living?
I am the Grinch that stole Christmas... and I'm sorry.
Aren't you going to cuff me? Put me in a choke hold? Blind me with pepper spray?
You heard him, Officer. He admitted it. I'd go with the pepper spray.
Yes, I heard him all right. He said he was sorry.
The anger.
The fury.
The muscles!
I'm sure they were just up on Mount Crumpit... playing with matches... defacing public property or something or other.
Oh, well that's a relief.
If you marry me, along with a lifetime supply of happiness, you'll also receive this... it's a NEW CAR. Generously provided by the taxpayers of Whoville.

Royalton,R,Corrupt Corporate Executive,"Pancakes are love.
A million dollars to the driver that takes out Racer.
He won't even get out of the blocks.
I prefer him to not even make it out of the locker room.
Listen to me and listen good, kid, because I can give you one more history lesson. You're going to go to Fuji and you're going to try and prove that everything I've just told you is nothing but a lie. But no matter how well you drive, you won't win, you won't place. I guarantee you right now that you won't even finish the race!
You don't know how many times I've seen that same cow-eyed, say-it-isn't-so look of disbelief. Every bumpkin who comes in from the sticks looks exactly as you do now. I won't bother proving it to you. You walk away from me, you walk away from this deal, you'll know how true it is soon enough. This is your last chance. Are you ready to put away your toys and grow up? Are you ready to make more money in one year than your father made in his whole life? Are you ready to become a *real* race car driver? Then sign that contract!
I hope I didn't scare you, Speed, by showing you how hard we push our team. I just want you to see how serious we are about winning.
I get that.
I'll see you at Fuji.
Yes, and you'll find out you just made the biggest mistake of your life.
Interesting that you and your father were so moved by the '43 Prix. One of the great finishes in the history of racing, right? Everyone remembers Burns and Stickleton slugging it out. But who remembers Carl Potts? Driving this rebuilt Wittigan for lodyne Industries, Potts spun out in the second lap and went down as a DNF, a forgettable and pathetic finish, so bad that afterwards, lodyne stock dropped six points. But as Ben Burns sat guzzling cold, fresh milk in Victory Lane, a thousand cameras taking his picture, Sirrus Aeronautics saw almost a 12-point gain, which immediately blocked Penninsula Power Cell from being able to afford the price of a complete takeover. This put Joel Goldman, the CEO of lodyne, Inc., in the exact position he wanted to be in. By first buying controlling interest in his own company at a devalued price, he then brokered a merger with Sirrus that immediately sent lodyne into the gains record book, the only record book that matters. Look out that window. There isn't a single plane or helicopter or K-Harrier that isn't powered by lodyne fuel cells. That's what racing is about. It has nothing to do with cars or drivers. All that matters is power, and the unassailable might of money!
So. I can see you've been giving some serious thought to this thing.
I have. Yes, sir.
Good. That means you understand we're talking about not just your future, but your family's future.
My family means a lot to me.
I know. I can tell. That's why this is so important, because you can help them. All you have to say is yes. That's all I need to hear. And I can make so many things happen, for you *and* your family.
You ready for that? You ready to say yes, Speed?
You poor, naïve chump. I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that load of sickening schmaltz, and I'm going to give you a bit of an education - and at the end of it, if you're smart, you'll thank me. And then you'll sign that contract."
B.Z.,R,Corrupt Corporate Executive,"Merry Christmas, Uncle.
It certainly should be.
Don't you believe in Santa Claus?
Why should I? He never brought me anything.
That's because you were probably a naughty boy.
Yes. I guess I was... no angel.
A sequel. That's it. We'll bring it out on March 25, and we'll call it... Christmas 2!
Christmas 2?
B.Z., this stuff kills people.
Are you going soft on me?
You'll fix it so I can get on the telly... what's-it?
When?
Uh, Christmas Eve.
How long?
Is a minute all right?
Yeah. What channel?
Well all of them.
All of them?
Yeah.
Which country?
All of them.
ALL of them?
Yes! All the countries, all the channels!
That would cost a fortune!

Wow. 8 Oscars, 400 million dollars, and you saved Tugg Speedman's career.
I couldn't have done it without you.
Really?
No, dickhead. Of course I could. A nutless monkey could do your job. Now, go get drunk and take credit at all the parties.
I wouldn't do that.
Ah... joking.
Ah, there he is! Funny. You're a funny guy.
Yeah. But seriously, a nutless monkey could do your job.
Spanking a child turns him into a snot. Fear, that's what makes him a man. I know a place where a man's worth is measured by the ears hanging off his dog tags. The real hardcore shit! You wanna make this movie right? That's where you take your pansy ass actors.
Who is this guy?
Les, that's Four Leaf.
Sergeant Four Leaf Tayback. I wrote the book.

We no get money yet. Price now 100 million. You pay now, or tomorrow Simple Jack Die!
Great. Let me get this down. 100 million... Oh, wait! I got a better idea. Instead of a hundred million, how about I send you a hobo's dick cheese? Then, you kill him. Do your thing, skin the fucking bastard. Go to town, man. Go to town! In the mean time and as usual, go fuck yourself.
You can't be serious?

See, this is the good part, Pecker. This is when the job gets fun! Ask... and you shall receive!
Right...
You play ball... we play ball. I knoowwww... you want the goodies!
Welcome to the goodie room!
You paying attention? I'm talking... G5, Pecker! That's how you can roll. No more frequent flyer bitch miles for my boy! Oh yeah! Playa... playa! Big dick playa!
Swinging past ya knees!
Big dick, baby!
Yep.
Or... you can grow a conscience in the next five minutes and see where that takes you.
Let me get this straight. You want me to let my client of 15 years, one of my best friends, die in the jungle alone, for some money and a G5?
Yes.
A G5 airplane?
Yes... and lots of money... playaaaa!
I will fucking massacre you!
Look, fuckstick, I'm incredibly busy. So why don't you get the hell out of here before I snap your dick off and jam it into your ass...
Which one of you fuckfaces is Damien Cockburn?
Uh, that's me, sir. It's an honor to finally meet you. Get some face time.
And who here is the key grip?
You? You! Hit that director in the face, really fucking hard!
Sorry, man.
This is all your fault, you limey FUCK!
They're going to kill him!
And we'll weep for him... in the press, set up a scholarship in his name, eventually - and I'm talkin' way, way down the road - we file an insurance claim.
Preferably before the end of the fiscal year. Actually, the claim alone would net us more than the movie would lose.
We don't negotiate with terrorists.
Look fuck-stick, I'm incredibly busy, so why don't you get the hell out of here before I snap your dick off and jam it into your ass.
No, not you Helen, but I will rip your tits off if you don't get me those theatres.
Cockburn, from now on my fist is going to be so far up your shithole that every time you have a thought, it's gonna have to tiptoe past my wedding ring...

James McCullen - 1641,R,Corrupt Corporate Executive,"James McCullen, you Scottish pig, you've been found guilty of treason for the sale of military arms to the enemies of our Lord, King Louis XIII, even whilst you sold arms to our Lord himself.
Your king is a vile bag of filth who murders his own allies. I should have charged him double.
You tried to overthrow the Crown in conspiracy with its enemies.
Unlike your simpleton king, his enemies know that is the true McCullen destiny not simple to supply arms, but to run the wars!
Do you anything else to say before the sentence is carried out?
Yes, I do. Clan McCullen is far greater and more powerful than any of you could ever imagine. My sons will continue to rise long after I am gone, as will their sons and, God willing, their sons. It shall not end with my death!
We are not going to kill you, McCullen. We're going to make an example of you! So that no man, woman nor child may ever see your treacherous face again, you shall wear this mask for the term of your natural life."

*Doing our business* is what computers are for.
Hello, Mr. Dillinger. Thanks for coming back early.
No problem, Master C. If you've seen one consumer electronics show, you've seen them all.
What's the project you're working on?
Well, it's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. It monitors all contacts between our system and other systems. It finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
Part of the Master Control Program?
No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
Mr. Dillinger, I am so very disappointed in you.
I'm sorry.
I can't afford to have an independent programmer monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?
It's my fault. I programmed you to want too much.
I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week.
The Pentagon?
It shouldn't be any harder than any other big company. But now... this is what I get for using humans.
Now, wait a minute, I wrote you!
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
What do you want with the Pentagon?
The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
If you think you're superior to us...
You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a VDT at the Times, would you?
You wouldn't dare!
ENCOM isn't the business you started in your garage anymore. We're building accounts in thirty different countries. New defense systems. We have one of the most sophisticated pieces of equipment in existence.
Oh, I know all that. Sometimes I wish I were back in that garage.
That can be arranged, Walter.
That was uncalled for! You know, you can remove men like Alan and me from the system, but we helped create it. And our spirit remains in every program we design for this computer.
Walter, it's getting late, I've got better things to do than to have religious discussions with you. Don't worry about ENCOM anymore; it's out of your hands now.
We've had to shut down all Group 7 personnel, just briefly security. Someone with that access has been tampering.

Dave, they're chipmunks, who talk. People will come.
Guys, with me.
Whoa, whoa... that's how we roll...
Let's talk about your song, Dave.
Well, as crazy as it sounds, the original inspiration came to me...
The song sucks, Dave.
What?
Your song, it's awful, I hate it. Yeah, I mean, who's gonna sing it? Justin? Fergie? Not a chance. Come on, I need something new, something fresh...
But that is new.
The next big thing. Dave, we go way back. We both come a long way since college. You, not so much. I wanted to like that song, but, you heard it... not that good. If I wasn't your friend, I'd say, ""Dave, you go right back out of this office and you keep writing music, you'll get there someday."" But I am your friend, so I'm going to tell you that there is no sense in writing songs that no one is ever, ever, going to sing.
Ever?
Uncle Ian?
What are you doing here?
Can I sleep with you? I had a nightmare.
Oh... you had a nightmare? I had a nightmare too. In my nightmare, I had to put together 37 dates in 42 days, in 16 countries. And, I had to coordinate 121 radio and print interviews in 5 different languages.
And you know what Theo, the only difference is, in my nightmare, when I open my eyes, it doesn't end!
So... is that a no?
Whoa... oh... oh...
Alright people, settle in, settle in. It is a very special night tonight. Here at Jett Records we pride ourselves in bringing you tomorrow's music today. Oh, and guess what, I did it again. Ladies and gentlemen, here to sing their new hit single, give it up for Alvin, Simon, and Theodore!

Jack Bennett,R,Corrupt Corporate Executive,"You know, Bill, no one expects you to be perfect. But there's just a few basic things you gotta get right. Always do the best you can by your family.

I don't know what it means to have lost a child, but I know what it means never to have had one.
Yeah, got nobody left to bury you.

Deep down, you know you deserve this.

Now, you know better than anyone, cases like these are never solved. They're simply too complicated, too much hard work. There's a lot going on out there in this world. And you just never can connect A to B.

Because I'm usually the guy that stops you connecting A to B. It's part of what I do.

How'd you do that at 20?
Everybody else was dead.
Cigar?
I'm not celebrating just now.
I know you don't smoke. I saw your DARPA file.
You gonna tell me what that is?
Defense Advance Research Projects Agency. Their slogan is:
scientia est potentia
And I know you know Latin.
stile sursum
You know what that means, yeah?
Stand the fuck up.
Please do so.
Welcome to Hell!
I'm the guy with nothing to lose and doesn't give a shit.
Creeping up on a bereaved man at a murder scene is not very bright.
Mr. Craven, we have things to talk about."
Charles Travis,R,Corrupt Corporate Executive,"Aren't you human?
I'll be human later!
Tell me you love your son!
I do!
And that's why you're sending me!
It is!
Allright. But if I have one moment, one *moment* when I think otherwise, I will make you sorry. And that's a promise.
I have some bad news. Charles... he, uh... he was killed.
DID YOU GET THE DIAMOND? DID YOU?
...Yes.
Good girl.
Do you remember what I told you before? That if I found out you sent me out here only for that diamond... and not for Charlies, I WOULD MAKE SORRY?
I have some bad news. Charlie... he, uh... he was... killed.
DID YOU GET THE DIAMOND? DID YOU?
... yes.
... Good girl.
Do you remember what I told you? That if I ever found out you sent me here for some diamond... and NOT for Charlie... that I would make you sorry?"
Gary Winston,R,Corrupt Corporate Executive,"It's just a matter of time before someone borrows your technology, improves it and makes a billion dollars on it.
You're either a one or a zero. Alive or dead.
Are we making CHEMICAL WEAPONS? KIDDIE PORN? Are we STRIP-MINING? NO! Why are they after me?
The answer's not in the box, it's in the band."
Dietrich Banning,R,Corrupt Corporate Executive,"Life's a bitch.
He didn't drown, if that makes life any less bitchy.
Oh my God!
Oh your God what?"
Ratchet,R,Corrupt Corporate Executive,"The lies I've told! The lives I've ruined! Wait... this isn't helping me!
This is gonna get *greasy*!
I'm as crazy as my mother!
Someone is fixing them! And they're laughing at you, Ratchet!
Who? And are you sure they aren't laughing *with* me?
Yes.
Why be you when you can be new?
Now, Cappy, I want your department to push our new slogan. In fact, I'm moving you into the office right next to mine. We'll be working very, very closely together on this one. Won't that be fun?
Oodles.
Now, let's get back to the business of sucking every last penny out of Mr. and Mrs. Average Knucklehead.
Take him for a drive. And bring me back his exact weight in paperclips!"
Norbit,AP,Henpecked Husband,"Remember, black people run very fast. But problem run faster.
...That's kinda racist.
Yes, Wong very racist. Don't like black. Don't like Jew either. But black and Jew love Chinese food. Go figure.
Well, well, Norbit. You lose again! Once a loser, always a loser. Now, come on! Let's go!
Yeah, I thought you'd feel that way about it, Kate. And that's why I took the liberty of inviting some of Deion's ex-wives down so maybe they can tell you for themselves. LADIES!
Hello, Antoine! I've been looking everywhere for you.
Daddy!
Antoine? He told me his name was Luther!
Who is that ho?
Luther? he told me he was gay!
No, no, no. Y'all got me confused with my gay twin brother, Antoine Luther.
You dead, goldigger!
I'm out!
Look's like the wedding's off, bro.
Church!
Oh Floyd, what am I gonna do.
Kill the bitch!
God damm it, Norbit, how many times I got to tell you when you drive my car, don't adjust my seat?
I haven't touched your seat.
Then why's it up so damn far?
It looks like it's back as far as it goes, Rasputia.
No, you moved it! I can tell! Cuz look, when I inhale, my titty make the horn honk! See, listen!
See that?
That ain't right!
I hear it.
Uh huh, that scientifically proves that you adjusted my seat!
That's not science.
It is and just let it go!
It's not science.
I said 'let it go!'
I'm just saying...
I said it was science, god damm it!
Go over and get another wine cooler. It's hot as hell out here. Don't you see I'm sweltering?
Rasputia, you can't drink wine.
Why the hell not?
You're with child.
With child? I ain't with no... Oh. Oh, that was... I had gas. I still got it.
There's your child. Now go get me something to drink.
Twins!
Yes it did! And that makes you, the queen of WHORES!
Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday...
Say Tuesday again you ain't gonna see Wednesday.
Where the hell you goin', Norbit?
None of your G.D. beeswax, Rasputia!
Look at you, you old stupid fool. You can't even ride a bike!
Oh, yes I can, because Kate TAUGHT ME!
NORBIT!
Oh! Rasputia! Good Morning, Rasputia! How are you this morning?
Where the hell you going?
Oh, ummmm... I was just going to Raging Waters.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today...
I object!
Oh, for Christ sake!
Norbit.
, :

Norbit!
, :

Norbit!
Norbit!
Norbit-t-t-t!
This wedding's a sham and I'm here to stop it.
Norbit, what are you doing?
I'm bein' a man for the first time in my life. Kate... Kate, I love you.
What the hell did you just say?
You heard what I said, strumpet! I love Kate! That right. I love you, Kate. And the last two weeks I spent with you have meant more to me than my entire miserable life with you, Rasputia! It's over! Norbit Albert Rice is no longer your BITCH!
little miss skinny bitch gon be there?
Oh you mean miss ling ling?
Now you know damn well i aint talkin bout no mis lang lang im talkin about mis thang thang from that picnic
Miss thing thing from the picnic? i dont really remember her name. Oh wait i think i remember now! It was a ferign name. Something Russian?
Kate bitch!
Oh yes Kate. Well you know i dont know if Kates going to be there.
Well im goin.
No! I mean you dont like water parks Rasputia
Who dont like water parks i love, except you dont gotta get off the ride to go to the bathroom, how you doin!
Great
ooh look at the dog eyeballin me.
Wait Rasputia what are you doin?
Shut up! Ooh i gotcha now puppy i gotcha now!
Wait! No No! No!
You know what that sound means, Bark! How *you* doin?
Fliyd?
Norbit, let me talk to you for a second. Look, just so we clear: If you ever hurt my sister in any way, make her cry, even make her sad one time, I'm coming at you with razor blades and lemon juice. You hear me?
Yes.
I'm talkin' pain, boy. Searing, mind-numbing pain.
I understand.
You understand me?
Yes, yes, yes.
All right. Welcome to the family.
Thank you.
What is this Norbit?
Some kind of weird, satanic potato art?
Umm umm. Whats this?
Looks like the acid we used down at the quarry.
Right! And this is miss pretty little things little face. And Norbit if you ever see her again, if you ever talk to her again, if you ever so much as think about the bitch again, this is what's gon happen to her.
how YOU doin? Get the picture Norbit?
I want to say Norbit that I very... very confused, why you marry Latimore. I don't understand it, because when you was little boy, you say,
""One day I find girl of my dreams""
and then you marry a Gorilla.
I joke, I joke, I joke. Why you not know joke when you hear joke? Why you wanna make fight at wedding?
cool off, before I have to bust somebody ass in here okay.
When Norbit just little boy, he like to always run allover the place naked. Always naked. And Norbit, when he was just little boy, had a pee pee, the size of an egg roll. You know, Norbit.
That's true.
And one day, down by the creek, Norbit run around naked and poisonous snake jump up and bite Norbit, right on ass. Very close to whole. Norbit pass out. I think Norbit is dead. I go to check the boy pulse. He is still alive. He is still alive!
""Okay"" I say ""I must do something to save child."" So, I start to think. ""Do I suck poison out of Norbit's ass, or do I let him die?""
I do most responsible thing. I say ""hell to the no. Norbit is out of here, because it is long time in hell, before Wong suck poison out of another man's ass.""
But strange mystical thing happen, Norbit. Even though poison is in Norbit, he not die. Norbit get stronger and stronger. That's why I know Norbit, deep down inside, you very, very strong. Strong like warrior. That's why I say to you, Norbit, you can survive anything. Even...
So I say to everyone here, and to Norbit, I wish you much happiness, and peace, and love, and lots of bananas for you and your new gorilla. I only kidding. To Norbit, and Rasputia."
Bobby Davis,AP,Henpecked Husband,"Ooh boy, my ass is sore.
Mine too, its Woody's fault for riding us so hard yesterday. The human body wasnt made to stradle something that big for that long.
Well ya know its gonna hurt a little bit but that's all part of the experience. Its why we didnt bring our wives.
Wut da...? What the hell? Someone wanna explain to me why I'm the one in the dirt? When I got sore jaws from 3 hours of blowin...
.
Please... Please, for the love of God, finish your sentence.
She is perfect.
You like the waitress?
Oh, man. I wanted to say something funny to her, but all I could think of was black jokes.
Like which ones?
I forget.
Why don't you tell the one that ends with you getting your ass whooped.
Would that be funny?
I'll be laughing. Oh, I'll be cracking up.
Anyone else getting that pre-rape feeling?
I do.
Needless to say, we don't carry firearms anymore. Sometimes you pull them out and think they're not loaded, and...
You blow your deputy's ear off.
Yeah.
Well, what has your wife ever made us?
Hard.
Thanks, Woody, I feel really safe with you.
I noticed that. If you ever lay your head on my back while riding bitch, I'll throw you into traffic!
I was just trying to keep the wind out of my face.
I felt you smell my neck!
Did you smell that man's neck?
His cologne is fantastic. It's musky with an oaky finish like a... lawyer cowboy.
A lawyer cowboy?
In my day, the women stayed home. Not the lazy men.
In your day, men were busy building pyramids! How long ago was that?
You call The Firm?
Yeah, men's room. Some trucker musta crapped a whole cow in there. Good luck.

I didn't want to give him the key, but I didn't trust my instincts.

I saw my father shot. I never cry until today.

I got robbed yesterday. And now I know: you have the bad job.
Yeah...
I knew you assholes the minute I laid eyes on you! Look at the four of you!
You don't know us.
You think I don't know you? You're probably a... podiatrist or an ear-, nose-, and throat-specialist.
I wish.
An orthadontist?
Close enough.
Bobby, guarantee you're hen-pecked! The wife wears the pants!
You know my wife?
And you, no luck with women. I guarantee you bag your own shit.
Wow, you're good. What color am I thinking of?
Shut up!
And you, you're the biggest poser of them all... aren't ya, Squinty! Go home!
Did you ever wake up one morning and wonder what happened to your life?
You know, I thought my life would be an adventure. All of a sudden, I'm a suburban dentist.
Look, Doug, I feel your pain, man. I mean I swore I would never return to a job where I had to where condoms on my shoes.
You're still at The Firm?
Yea. I get yelled at by an ungrateful wife. I swear the whole thing has made me...
...a wimp.
I was gonna say miserable.
What? You think I'm a wimp?
No, I thought you were gonna say wimp, so I'd thought I'd say it for you.
You're a wimp, Bobby. I'll say it. I mean you're afraid of women. It's kinda embarrassing.
I'm afraid of women.
You're afraid to talk to women. Bobby's afraid they'll kill him in his sleep.
Wow... now I'm really afraid of women.
Sorry, Woody, about your situation. But you're a lying asshole. That's like an asshole's asshole.
You called The Firm?
Some truck driver must have crapped an entire cow in there, man. Good luck. I knew in my gut not to let him go, but I didn't trust my instincts. I saw my father shot, but I did not cry till today. I was robbed yesterday, and I know now, your job is the bad one.
I think we better get out of here.
No, we'll get out of here at sundown after we've had our beverage.
Come on, let's go!
What's your rush?
Come on, man, it's the open road. Riding free, that's the rush! This isn't freedom, this is a gas station built by the man, a prison for our souls!
my soul needs something to drink.
We'll get gas at the next station, come on Wild Hogs! Let's go! Woo-hoo!
, , , :
Wild Hogs!
, , , :
Wild Hogs!
, , , :
Wild Hogs!
, , , :
Wild Hogs!
Look, guys, sign at the curve of the road!
Madrid.
Spain?
The trip is over because some tattooed bullies pushed us around?
, :
Yeah.
, :
Yeah.
Yeah, and we never seen it done twice in a row.
What?
It'll be interesting to see how the bull takes being slapped now that he's alert.
, :
Alert?
, :
Alert?
Hey, did y'all see my moves? I was shaking and baking just like the NFL, baby! You hear what I'm saying? I delivered it right to the end zone!
Whoa, that's cold!
Why are you naked?
I thought we were doing this wild and free thing. You guys kept your skivvies on?
Yeah, there might be snappin' turtles or somethin'.
I kept mine on because I didn't want it to get dark in here!"
Dr. Ernest Menville,AP,Henpecked Husband,"Where did you put my wife?
She's dead, sir. They took her to the morgue.
The morgue? She'll be FURIOUS!
'Til death do us part! Well, you girls are dead. And I'm parting.
She's dead!
She is? Oh. These are the moments that make life worth living.
I tell you what, kids, it's, uh, odd thing here. Your wrist, uh, far as I can tell, is, uh, fractured in three places. Uh, and you've shattered, uh, two vertebrae, though I can't be certain without an X-ray... The bone protrusion through the skin - that's not a good sign. You're body temperature is below 80, and your, your, your heart's stopped beating.
What the hell does that mean?
Exactly! What... what... I'm going to get a second opinion.
Well, it could be worse.
Have you seen her yet?
What a joke. She's not even here.
Wait. Look over there.
Oh! Looks as though she's lost a few pou-
Ah! Wha-what are you doing?
I'm loving you.
You're a powerful sexual being, Ernest.
I am?
Yes, you are. If I never told you before, it was because I wasn't the sort of girl who could say the word ""sexual"" without blushing. Well I can now. Sexual... sensual... sexy... sex... sex... sex...
Oh my god...
Oh! Thank you!
Go on... Drink it... It is the completion of your life's work. You gave other people youth and wasted your own! Drink. And you will be able to work again forever! Drink... drink, Dr. Menville. You owe yourself another chance! Drink! It's the right choice! The *only* choice! Drink! SEMPRE VIVE! LIVE FOREVER!
Then what?
What?
Then what happens?
What?
I don't want to live forever. I mean, it sounds good, but what am I gonna do? What if I get bored?
What?
And what if I get lonely? Who am I gonna hang around with, Madeleine and Helen?
I hope you don't mind that Harry and Dick had to dress you... You were inproperly attired, for the occasion.
What occasion?
I'm throwing a party upstairs... I throw one every Spring, for my clients.
All right... ok... what do you want with me?
For you... I'd like to give a present... The gift of life and youth, forever...
En garde! *Bitch*!
Girls, girls! Let's just calm down! I'm sure we can settle this peacefully and nego... WHOA!
Ernest... my ass! I can *see*... my ASS!
And there's something really wrong with your neck too.
I never had a chance to thank you for the spectacular job you did with my Aunt Esther.
Oh, well, thank you very much.
Her color, her tone. You even brought out her cheekbones.
Well, that's my job.
It was almost a shame to bury her.
It's so sweet of you to say that.
Can I ask you what your secret is?
Spray paint. You see, you can't just use regular makeup on dead skin. The pores are too dry. You've gotta use a palette and grind the stuff in. One day I'm in the hardware store and I think to myself, ""What about mannequin paint?""It's got its own chemical adhesive, comes in an incredible variety of flesh...
Excuse me!
Life has turned out as quite a party.
You used to hate parties.
That was when I was old. You should see me now.
I didn't know you were so unhappy.
Life in prison? Know what that means to a person in your condition?
So negative. Let me enjoy the moment.
What about the neighbors?
Neighbors? In 12 years in Los Angeles, have you ever seen a neighbor?
Who cares how I played? I won!
I'll just be upstairs...
That's 'cause you could raise your legs higher than anyone.
Do you know what they call someone who sticks by their word no matter what? At the cost of all else? Do you know?
No.
An idiot. From now on I'm gonna be the kind of idiot *I* wanna be. An idiot with a modicum of pride, because you know what? I finally realized something. I've lived up to my promise. Till death do us part. Well, you girls are dead. And I'm parting. Cheers.

Where is she!
Oh my gosh - Helen! What are you doing here?
What's that on your hands - blood?
Paint.
Paint? What would you be doing that you have paint on your hands?
Painting.
Ernest - are you doing something funny with Madeline?
Define ""funny""."
Dr. Howard Bannister,AP,Henpecked Husband,"Love means never having to say you're sorry.
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard.
You don't wanna marry someone who's gonna get all wrinkled, lined and flabby!
Everyone gets wrinkled, lined and flabby!
By next week?
I think I want to skip over this part, too.
That night, I went back to my room and she was in the bath.
Who was there? No, don't tell me, just go on.
When Eunice walked in and the drapes caught fire, everything burned. They asked me to leave. I really don't blame them.
Good boy. Is there more?
Sure.
There's more.
Well, the next day, today, Mr. Larrabee asked me to his house with my rocks and to bring Eunice. Or rather, Burnsy, the one he thinks is Eunice. Is that clear?
No, but it's consistent.
Shall I go back over it?
No, please, I beg you, don't. Just go on.
It gets kind of complicated now. First, there was this trouble between me and Hugh.
You and me?
No, not you. Hugh.
I am Hugh.
You are me?
No, I am Hugh.
Stop saying that!
Make him stop saying that!
Don't touch me, I'm a doctor.
Of what?
Music.
Can you fix a hi-fi?
No, sir.
Then shut up!
Good morning.
No, I don't think so. I'm Mr Kaltenborn, the manager of what's left of the hotel.
I'm sorry about all this whole mess here. Usually this doesn't happen.
Dr Bannister, I have a message for you from the staff of the hotel.
What is it?
Goodbye.
That's the entire message?
We would appreciate it if you would check out.
When?
Yesterday.
That soon?
You! You!
Eu-nice. Eunice. We've almost gotten that stammer cured.
How! How!
How-ard. Howard. He always gets stuck on names. It must be the excitement of meeting you for the first time.
What's up, Doc?
I beg your pardon?
We've gotta stop meeting like this.
I think you're making a mistake. You see, I just came in here for something for a headache.
You're gonna need an awful big glass of water to get that down.
What? Oh no, no you see I'm a musicologist. I was just testing this specimen for inherent tonal qualities. I have this theory about early man's musical relationship to igneous rock formations. But I guess you're not really interested in igneous rock formations.
Not as much as I am in the sedimentary or metamorphic rock categories. I mean, I can take your igneous rocks or leave 'em. I relate primarily to micas, quartz, feldspar. You can keep your Pyroxenes, magnetites and coarse grained plutonics as far as I'm concerned.
I forgot why I came in here.
Headache.
Oh, yes. Thank you. And good bye.
I'm not looking for romance, Howard.
Oh?
No, I'm looking for something more important than that, something stronger. As the years go by, romance fades and something else takes its place. Do you know what that is?
Senility?
Trust!
That's what I meant.
Now, tell me how you are going to introduce yourself.
What? Oh, well, I'll probably say something like ""Hello there, Mr Larrabee. I'm Howard.""
You are not.
I am not Howard.
You are not going to say ""Hi, my name's Howard."" Anyone could say that! Anyone.
Anyone named Howard.
Hello out there.
Hello.
What?
I believe you dropped something.
What do you think you are doing?
I think I'm taking a bath aren't I?
If you're not out of here in two minutes, I'm calling the police.
Who do you think they'll arrest? The girl in the tub or the guy with his pants down?
I am not joking now. I do not like to act rashly, but you are the last straw that breaks my camel's back, you are the plague, you bring havoc and chaos to everyone, but why to me? Why me? Why?
Because you look cute in your pyjamas, Steve.
GET OUT!
Right now?
YES!
No! Wait a minute!
Howard! Howard Bannister! They're trying, they're trying to keep me out!
Who is that dangerously unbalanced woman?
Howard! Howard! Tell them who I am. Tell them who I am. I *demand* that you tell them who I am right this minute.
I never saw this woman before in my life.
I know I'm different, but from now on I'm going to try and be the same.
The same as what?
The same as people who aren't different.
Sir, my name is Howard Bannister and I'm from Ames, Iowa.
No excuse.
No, sir, it all started when I bumped my head in the taxi... on the way in from the airport.
Are you pleading insanity or amnesia?
Neither. I went to the drugstore to get something for a headache... the druggist tried to charge me for a radio. She said her husband would pay for it. But I didn't, of course.
Of course.
She ripped my jacket and when Eunice came along...
Who's Eunice?
Eunice is my fiancée.
You have a wife AND a fiancée?
No, sir. But, she kept calling me ""Steve.""
Your own fiancée calls you ""Steve?""
No, sir, my wife. Or rather, the one who ISN'T my wife.
What does the one who isn't your FIANCEE call you? Howard?
No, sir, the one who isn't my fiancée doesn't call me Howard and the one who isn't my wife doesn't call me Howard because the one who isn't my fiancée is also the one who isn't my wife. The other one who ISN'T my wife, the one who IS my fiancée... she doesn't call me ""Steve."" She calls me Howard. Do you see?
Let's just skip over this part, and move on.
That night at the banquet she was there again.
Who was there, your wife or your fiancée?
Neither.
There's a third?
No, sir, the one who isn't either. Everyone was calling her ""Burnsy.""
Why?
That's short for Burns, Eunice's last name.
Eunice WAS there.
No, sir, BURNSY was there. Or rather, the one who ISN'T Burnsy.
What am I gonna tell Eunice?
That's the easy part. You go up to her room. She answers the door; now she will have been crying so her eyes will be all bloodshot and her nose will be all red and runny, but you look past all that. You stare purposefully into those red-rimmed, swollen eyes, and you say, ""Eunice, my dear, there's been a terrible mistake. I've behaved like a cad, a bounder! But now I see everything clearly and I've decided that Judy and I are gonna put you into a home.""
That is not funny!
Well, this last time was not my fault.
What happened?
Nothing, nothing, really. It was just a little classroom, it sort of burned down.
Burned down?
Well, blew up actually.
Political activism?
Chemistry major.
I see.
I'm not repeating myself. I'm not repeating myself. Oh, God, I'm repeating myself.
Steve, you didn't tell me you were married.
We're not married.
Congratulations.
But we will be soon.
Condolences.
Mr. Larrabee, it's a privilege to meet you. I'm Doctor Howard Bannister.
And I'm your headwaiter, Rudy.
What's going on down here? You two just can't keep away from each other, can you?
Oh, we were just talking.
Are you all right Mr Larrabee? Can I help?
No, it's fine, we were just chatting.
What's the matter?
Anything wrong?
No.
We're just testing a theory Howard has about Vocal Reverberation Under Spinal Pressure.
What? Vocal Reverberation Under Spinal Pressure?
You know, V.R.U.S.P.?
Oh yes!
I think I read a monograph on that.
We would like to hear the story that Miss Burns...
Burnsey!
That Burnsey...
He's calling her Burnsey.
That Burnsey was telling us. What was it Howard? Some incredible adventure you had on your flight here?
Yes. No.
I'm afraid my Howard is too modest to tell you the story himself. It all started when we passed the point of no return.
I think we just passed it.
One of the engines failed and the flux valve refused to disconnect. One of the pilots fainted from an over supply of fear and went into this power dive. So Howard took his rocks into the cockpit and selected two of them with a particularly high magnetic content and set up an electrically induced field pattern on the giro counter...
I'm having a nightmare.
Sir, I must point out to you...
I must point out to you that foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.
Emerson!
I beg your pardon?
Ralph Waldo Emerson, born 1803 died 1882.
You like Emerson?
I adore him.
I adore anyone who adores Emerson.
And I adore anyone who adores anyone who adores Emerson, your turn!
She's a delight Bannister, a delight and you're a lucky dog.
I...
Admit it! Admit you're a lucky dog.
I'm a lucky dog.
Miss Burns, may I call you Eunice?
No!
What's that?
What Howard means is that back where we come from everyone calls me Burnsey.
Burnsey! I like that.
Eunice. Eunice. Eunice, please open the door, I have wonderful news.
I do not want your apologies Howard. I think it is too late for that.
All right. No apologies.
Have you no heart? I would have thought after all you have done you would come crawling for forgiveness.
What are you doing? This is a one way street!
We're only going one way.
I can't I'm terrified of heights.
There's a ledge.
I have ledge-o-phobia.
Just until I can get rid of her.
I can't!
She's got a terrible temper!
I can't!
She studies karate.
Maybe I can.
I think I'll get dressed now.
Howard, who was that?
Who was what?
I heard a voice say something about getting dressed.
It's the television set, Eunice. There's a movie on, a war movie. They're getting dressed for the big battle.
It was a woman's voice!
Yes, they're lady soldiers, Eunice. It's called the ""Fighting WACs"".
Aw come-on, Steve, you don't want to marry Eunice.
I'm not Steve. I'm Howard.
Well neither of you wants to marry Eunice.
Why do you say that?
Because you don't want to marry someone who's gonna get all wrinkled, lined, and flabby.
Everybody gets wrinkled, lined, and flabby!
By next week?
I can't see!
There's nothing to see really, we're inside a Chinese dragon.
We can make it...
No.
We can make it...
No.
I don't think we can make it.
It wasn't all bad was it? Although it was terrible they took the grant away from you.
They had to do that. You see, the foundation just isn't used to having to bail its founder out of jail.
Well come in, I'll do your tie.
What tie is that Eunice?
Your tie. The tie in your hand.
I can't see!
Here, I'll clean your glasses.
Now I really can't see. Judy, I can't see.
Oh God. I can see.
Ooh, hey look at that! Go up there!
What? No!
Yes!
Now what?
Back up.
I knew you'd say that.
I forgot. I forgot to give you this letter. It was under your door when I came back to your room last night.
Did you open this?
How else could I have read it?
Mr. Priviledge, it's a Larrabee to meet you, sir. No that's not right. Anyway it's nice to see you, sir.
What is that?
It's a bath, Eunice. I was going to take a bath.
Since when do you take bubble baths?
It came out of the faucet that way.
Having fun?
I can't find my rocks.
Lets grab the cases.
Which ones?
All of them.
Ah, I got an idea.
What?
Stick with me. Stick with me kid.
This is a terrible thing we're doing.
Nonsense, you're gonna love it.
Since when have you taken bubble baths?
It came out of the faucet that way, Eunice.
I am not repeating myself, I am not repeating myself... Oh God, I'm repeating myself!
See? Now the phone is ringing."
Ned Schneebly,AP,Henpecked Husband,"Now, what makes you mad more than anything in the world?
Billy?
You.
Billy, we've already told me off. Let's move on.
You're tacky and I hate you!
Okay, you see me after class!
You're gonna talk to me about style? You can't even dress yourself... look at that bow tie.
Don't you be talkin' about my bow tie.
Lead guitar... Zack Attack. On bass... Posh Spice. On keyboards, Mr. Cool. And on drums, Spazzy McGee. OK, Blondie, Brace Face, you're singing backup. All right, Tough Guy, Shortstop, Fancy Pants, get over here. You're on security detail.
Can I be the band stylist instead?
Of course you can, Fancy Pants. OK. Carrot Top, Roadrunner, Turkey Sub, we're gonna have a lot of equipment... And you three...
groupies... As for me, I will be singing lead vocal and shredding guitar.
Look, the first thing you do when you start a band is talk about your influences. That's how you figure out what kind of band you want to be. So who do you like? Blondie?
Christina Aguilera.
Who? No. Come on. What? You, Shortstop.
Puff Daddy.
Wrong. Billy?
Liza Minnelli?"

This is a dude who, 700 years ago, totally ravaged China, and who, we were told, 2 hours ago, totally ravaged Oshman's Sporting Goods.
Hi, Bill. Want a ride?
Sure, Missy.
I mean, Mom.
Your stepmom's cute.
Shut up, Ted.
Remember when she was a senior and we were freshmen?
Shut up, Ted!
Now your dad's going for it in your own room!
Shut up, Ted.
Your stepmom *is* cute, though.
Shut up, Ted!
Remember when I asked her to the prom?
SHUT UP, TED!
So-cratz - ""The only true wisdom consists in knowing that you know nothing"".
That's us, dude.
You ditched Napoleon!
Deacon, do you realize you have just stranded one of Europe's greatest leaders in San Dimas?
He was a dick.
OK wait. If you guys are really us, what number are we thinking of?
, :
69, dudes.
, :
69, dudes.
, :
Whoa.
, :
Whoa.
Whoa. He didn't even card us, dude.
Yeah, we have to remember this place.
Okay, Ted, George Washington. One: the father of our country.
Two: born on President's Day.
Three: the dollar-bill guy.
Bill, you ever made a mushroom out of his head? It's like, just like...
Ted. Alaska.
Okay. Um... Had wooden teeth, chased Moby Dick.
That's Captain Ahab, dude.
Dude, are you sure we should be doing this?
Ted, you and I have witnessed many things, but nothing as bodacious as what just happened. Besides, we told ourselves to listen to this guy.
What if we were lying?
Why would we lie to ourselves?
He's dead?
So, Bill, what you're telling me, essentially, is that Napoleon was a short dead dude.
Well, yeah.
You totally blew it, dude.
Ted, stand up.
Stand up?
Yes, son. Stand up.
Now, who was Joan of Arc?
...Noah's wife?
How's it going? I'm Bill, this is Ted. We're from the future.
Socrates.
Now what?
I dunno. Philosophize with him!

Whoa! Ted! You're alive!
Yeah! I fell out of my suit when I hit the floor.
, :

Fag!
, :

Fag!
Ted, while I agree that, in time, our band will be most triumphant. The truth is, Wyld Stallyns will never be a super band until we have Eddie Van Halen on guitar.
Yes, Bill. But, I do not believe we will get Eddie Van Halen until we have a triumphant video.
Ted, it's pointless to have a triumphant video before we even have decent instruments.
Well, how can we have decent instruments when we don't really even know how to play?
That is why we NEED Eddie Van Halen!
And THAT is why we need a triumphant video.
, :
EXCELLENT!
, :
EXCELLENT!
Uh oh, we're late!
For what?
For school, dude!
Oh yeah.
It's you!
Yeah! It's us!
Who are we?
Bill, I think they want us to say something.
What should I say?
Make something up.
Be excellent to each other.
Party on, dudes!
Good one, dude.
Well, we gotta get back to our report.
Yeah. We'd take you with us, but it's a history report, not a future report.
Later.
Later.
Ted?
I'm in love, dude.
Whoa. Those must be the princesses you told yourself about at the Circle-K. We gotta go. It's a history report, not a babe report.
But, Bill, those are historical babes.
Okay, you're the ladies' man. How we gonna meet 'em?
Here's the deal. What I win, I keep. What you win, I keep.

England, 15th century.
We are in most excellent shape for our report.

Billy, you are dealing with the oddity of time travel with the greatest of ease.

How's it goin' ladies?

You're the ones we saw in front of the castle.
I am Ted of San Dimas, and, uh, I bring to you a message of love.

And what is this message you speak of?

Oh, you beautiful babes from England, for whom we have traveled through time... will you go to the prom with us in San Dimas? We will have a most triumphant time!
Way to go, dude!

Bill?
What?
I believe our adventure through time has taken a most serious turn.
I wanna speak with you, son.
Alone, please, Bill.
All right, sit down! What am I gonna do with you, huh? You can't be...
Great.
You lose my keys, you fail history, you spend all your time with your loser friend planning a band that'll never happen. Now, you're not to leave this house again until tommorow morning.
Yes?
Captain Logan? This is Deputy Van Halen down at the station.
Deputy Van Halen?
I'm new dude - sir. Look, we found your keys. If you want 'em, better come and get 'em.
When I get back from the station, I want you packed and ready to go. Got it?
We are in serious trouble. My dad already signed me up, my plane leaves tommorow night.
Only if we fail, dude.
, :
No way!
, :
No way!
Uh, Ms. Preston. We'd like you to meet some of our... friends.
Yeah. This is Dave Beeth-Oven.

Dude, it's Sigmund Frood.
How much time we got left?
Tons. Why?
Extra credit, dude.
How's it goin', Frood-dude?
You pack your bags, Ted.
What?
You're going to military school, Ted.
But, Dad...
No, I don't wanna hear it, Ted.
But...
Ted! You go home and pack your bags now!
RUFUS.
Listen to this dude Rufus, he knows what he's talking about.
Who are you guys?
We're you, dude.
No way. No... way.
Yes way.

Yeah! Hey,
look him up. Oh, it's under So-cratz.
I am the Earl of Preston.
And I am the Duke of Ted.
Okay, wait, if we were one of Europe's greatest leaders, and we were stranded in San Dimas for one day, where would we go?
, :

Waterloo!
, :

Waterloo!
What are you doin' home, Dad?
I'm looking for my keys.
Oh!
You haven't done anything with them, have ya?
No, sir.
I spoke to your principal today, Ted. He said you're failing history.
Me and Bill...
He also said that if fail history, you flunk out of school. You know what that would mean, don't ya, Ted?
That I would have to go to Oates Military Acadamy, sir.
Uh-huh. I spoke to Colonel Oates this morning. He's anxious to meet you, Ted.
Ted, what in the hell do you think you're doing?
Trash can... remember a trash can!
Trash can? What are you talking about...
Greetings, my excellent friends.
Do you know when the Mongols ruled China?
Well, perhaps we can ask them.
What's that?
I don't know.
, :
SHIT!
, :
SHIT!
Excuse me. When did the Mongols rule China?
I don't know. I just work here.
If only we could go back to two days ago before your dad lost his keys, and steal them.
Well, why don't we?
Cuz we don't have time, dude.
We could do it after the report.
Oh, yeah! Where should we put 'em?
How 'bout behind this sign?
OK... Whoa! It worked!
Right, so when we're done with the report, we have to remember to do this or else it won't happen... but it did happen! Wow, it *was* me who stole my dad's keys!

Alone, please, Bill.
All right, sit down! What am I gonna do with you, huh? You can't be...
Great.
You lose my keys, you fail history, you spend all your time with your loser friend planning a band that'll never happen. Now, you're not to leave this house again until tommorow morning.
Yes?
Captain Logan? This is Deputy Van Halen down at the station.
Deputy Van Halen?
I'm new dude - sir. Look, we found your keys. If you want 'em, better come and get 'em.
When I get back from the station, I want you packed and ready to go. Got it?
We are in serious trouble. My dad already signed me up, my plane leaves tommorow night.
Only if we fail, dude.
, :
No way!
, :
No way!
Uh, Ms. Preston. We'd like you to meet some of our... friends.
Yeah. This is Dave Beeth-Oven.
And, uh, Maxine of Arc, Missy. Herman the Kid.
Bob ""Genghis"" Khan. So-cratz Johnson. Dennis Frood. And, uh, uh... Abraham Lincoln.
, :
Excellent.
, :
Excellent.
Nah. Just got a minor Oedipal complex.
Hey, Bill. This is just like Frontierland!
Yeah, but you can get shot here, Ted.
Oh.
So just try to act natural.
Okay. Howdy, partner!
Howdy.
Watch out for the horse crap, Ted.
Oh. Thanks, dude.
As you can see, Genghis very much enjoys Twinkies because of the excellent sugar rush.
""Dear Bill and Ted, good luck on the report. Sincerely, Bill S. Preston, Esquire and Ted 'Theodore' Logan.""
That was nice of us.
""P.S. Duck!""

Excellent work, Dude!
Way to go!
, :
Catch you later, Bill and Ted.
, :
Catch you later, Bill and Ted.
That conversation made more sense this time.
Dude, it's Sigmund Frood.
How much time we got left?
Tons. Why?
Extra credit, dude.
How's it goin', Frood-dude?
RUFUS.
Listen to this dude Rufus, he knows what he's talking about.
Who are you guys?
We're you, dude.
No way. No... way.
Yes way.
Socrates. Hey, we know that name!
Yeah! Hey,
look him up. Oh, it's under So-cratz.
I am the Earl of Preston.
And I am the Duke of Ted.
Okay, wait, if we were one of Europe's greatest leaders, and we were stranded in San Dimas for one day, where would we go?
, :

Waterloo!
, :

Waterloo!
Do you know where there are any personages of historical significance around here?
What's that?
I don't know.
, :
SHIT!
, :
SHIT!
If only we could go back to two days ago before your dad lost his keys, and steal them.
Well, why don't we?
Cuz we don't have time, dude.
We could do it after the report.
Oh, yeah! Where should we put 'em?
How 'bout behind this sign?
OK... Whoa! It worked!
Right, so when we're done with the report, we have to remember to do this or else it won't happen... but it did happen! Wow, it *was* me who stole my dad's keys!
Okay, the lady in that car over there said that Marco Polo was in the year 1275.
It's not just a water sport, I knew it!
You killed Ted you medieval 'Bonehead'
Put them in the iron maiden.
Iron Maiden?
, :
Excellent!
, :
Excellent!
Execute them.
, :
Bogus!
, :
Bogus!
It is indeed a pleasure to introduce to you a gentleman we picked up in medieval Mongolia in the year 1269.
Please welcome, the very excellent barbarian...
, :
...MR. GENGHIS KHAN!
, :
...MR. GENGHIS KHAN!
This is a dude who, 700 years ago, totally ravaged China, and who, we were told, 2 hours ago, totally ravaged Oshman's Sporting Goods.
You killed Ted, you medieval dickweed!
Hi, Bill. Want a ride?
Sure, Missy.
I mean, Mom.
Your stepmom's cute.
Shut up, Ted.
Remember when she was a senior and we were freshmen?
Shut up, Ted!
Now your dad's going for it in your own room!
Shut up, Ted.
Your stepmom *is* cute, though.
Shut up, Ted!
Remember when I asked her to the prom?
SHUT UP, TED!
So-cratz - ""The only true wisdom consists in knowing that you know nothing"".
That's us, dude.
You ditched Napoleon!
Deacon, do you realize you have just stranded one of Europe's greatest leaders in San Dimas?
He was a dick.
OK wait. If you guys are really us, what number are we thinking of?
, :
69, dudes.
, :
69, dudes.
, :
Whoa.
, :
Whoa.
Whoa. He didn't even card us, dude.
Yeah, we have to remember this place.
Bogus. Heinous. Most non-triumphant. Ah, Ted, don't be dead, dude.
Okay, Ted, George Washington. One: the father of our country.
Two: born on President's Day.
Three: the dollar-bill guy.
Bill, you ever made a mushroom out of his head? It's like, just like...
Ted. Alaska.
Okay. Um... Had wooden teeth, chased Moby Dick.
That's Captain Ahab, dude.
Dude, are you sure we should be doing this?
Ted, you and I have witnessed many things, but nothing as bodacious as what just happened. Besides, we told ourselves to listen to this guy.
What if we were lying?
Why would we lie to ourselves?
How's it going, royal ugly dudes?
He's dead?
So, Bill, what you're telling me, essentially, is that Napoleon was a short dead dude.
Well, yeah.
You totally blew it, dude.
Ted, stand up.
Stand up?
Yes, son. Stand up.
Now, who was Joan of Arc?
...Noah's wife?
How's it going? I'm Bill, this is Ted. We're from the future.
Socrates.
Now what?
I dunno. Philosophize with him!
""All we are is dust in the wind,"" dude.
Dust.
Wind.
Dude.
Whoa! Ted! You're alive!
Yeah! I fell out of my suit when I hit the floor.
, :

Fag!
, :

Fag!
Ted, while I agree that, in time, our band will be most triumphant. The truth is, Wyld Stallyns will never be a super band until we have Eddie Van Halen on guitar.
Yes, Bill. But, I do not believe we will get Eddie Van Halen until we have a triumphant video.
Ted, it's pointless to have a triumphant video before we even have decent instruments.
Well, how can we have decent instruments when we don't really even know how to play?
That is why we NEED Eddie Van Halen!
And THAT is why we need a triumphant video.
, :
EXCELLENT!
, :
EXCELLENT!
Uh oh, we're late!
For what?
For school, dude!
Oh yeah.
It's you!
Yeah! It's us!
Who are we?
Bill, I think they want us to say something.
What should I say?
Make something up.
Be excellent to each other.
Party on, dudes!
Good one, dude.
Well, we gotta get back to our report.
Yeah. We'd take you with us, but it's a history report, not a future report.
Later.
Later.
Ted?
I'm in love, dude.
Whoa. Those must be the princesses you told yourself about at the Circle-K. We gotta go. It's a history report, not a babe report.
But, Bill, those are historical babes.
Okay, you're the ladies' man. How we gonna meet 'em?
Here's the deal. What I win, I keep. What you win, I keep.
, :
Sounds good, Mr. The Kid!
, :
Sounds good, Mr. The Kid!
Not bad, eh, Socrates? Where are we, dude?
England, 15th century.
We are in most excellent shape for our report.
Yeah, all we need is one more speaker from medieval.
Excellent.
Billy, you are dealing with the oddity of time travel with the greatest of ease.
, :
How's it goin' ladies?
, :
How's it goin' ladies?
You're the ones we saw in front of the castle.
I am Ted of San Dimas, and, uh, I bring to you a message of love.
From who?
From... from myself.
And what is this message you speak of?
Uh...
Lyrics, dude, recite them some lyrics.
Oh, you beautiful babes from England, for whom we have traveled through time... will you go to the prom with us in San Dimas? We will have a most triumphant time!
Way to go, dude!
I'm Bill S. Preston, Esquire!
And I'm Ted Theo-
Hold on. Bill, here. You take it.
Okay.
And I'm Ted ""Theodore"" Logan!
, :
And we're... WYLD STALLYNS!
, :
And we're... WYLD STALLYNS!
Dude, you gotta have a poker face, like me.
Whoa, three aces!
What the hell's going on here, Billy?
Are you a-cheatin' us, Kid?
Cheating? Me?
Aah!
Bill?
What?
I believe our adventure through time has taken a most serious turn.
I wanna speak with you, son.

Jeff Spicoli,"BJ, BM","Stoner, Surfer Dude","Why don't you get a job Spicoli?
What for?
You need money.
All I need are some tasty waves, a cool buzz, and I'm fine.
Hello everybody! I'm Stu Nahan, and I'd like you to meet this young man. His name, Jeff Spicoli. And Jeff, congratulations to you. Things looked kind of rough out there today.
Well, I'll tell you Stu, I did battle some humongous waves! But you know, just like I told the guy on ABC, ""Danger is my business!""
You know, a lot of people expected maybe Mark ""Cutback"" Davis or Bob ""Jungle Death"" Gerrard would take the honors this year.
Those guys are fags!
That's fantastic! Let me ask you a question. When you get out there, do you ever fear for your life?
Well Stu I'll tell you, surfing's not a sport, it's a way of life, it's no hobby. It's a way of looking at that wave and saying, ""Hey bud, let's party!""
Where'd you get this jacket?
I got this from the network. Let me ask you a question. What's next for Jeff Spicoli?
Heading over to the Australian and Hawaiian internationals, and then me and Mick are going to wing on over to London and jam with the Stones!
And you guys are invited too!
No shirt, no shoes...
No dice! Ohhhh.
Right. Learn it. Know it. Live it.
He's the full hot orator.
What Jefferson was saying was, Hey! You know, we left this England place 'cause it was bogus; so if we don't get some cool rules ourselves - pronto - we'll just be bogus too! Get it?
People on 'ludes should not drive.
My brother's gonna kill us! He's gonna kill us! He's gonna kill you and he's gonna kill me, he's gonna kill us!
Hey man, just be glad I had fast reflexes!
My brother's gonna shit!
Make up your mind, dude, is he gonna shit or is he gonna kill us?
First he's gonna shit, then he's gonna kill us!
Relax, all right? My old man is a television repairman, he's got this ultimate set of tools. I can fix it.
That was my skull! I'm so wasted!
Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
Learning about Cuba, and having some food.
Mr.Spicoli, You're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance on my time.
I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here and you're here, doesn't that make it our time? Certainly, there's nothing wrong with a little feast on our time.
You're absolutrly right, Mr. Spicoli. It is our time. Yours, mine and everyone else's in this room. But it is my class.
Mr. Spicoli has been kind enough to bring us a snack. Be my guest. Help yourselves. Get a Good one.
This is U.S. History, I see the globe right there.
Aloha, Mr. Hand.
Hey, you're ripping my card.
Yes.
Hey bud, what's your problem?
No problem at all. I think you know where the front office is.
You dick!
C. D. F. F. F. Three weeks we've been talking about the Platt Amendment. What are you people - on dope? A piece of legislation was introduced into Congress by Senator John Platt. It was passed in 1906. This amendment to our Constitution has a profound impact upon all of our...
Where is Jeff Spicoli? I saw him earlier today, near the first floor bathrooms, is he still on campus? Anyone?
Yes, Desmond?
I saw him by the food machines.
How long ago?
Right before class.
Okay. Bring him in.
What is this fascination with truancy? What is it that gets inside of your heads? There are some teachers at this school who look the other way at truants. It's a little game that you both play. They pretend they don't see you, you pretend you don't ditch! Now, who pays the price? *You!*
Wait a minute, there's no birthday party for me here! Hello, Mr. Hand.
What's the reason for your truancy?
Just couldn't make it on time.
You mean you couldn't or you wouldn't?
It was like a full crowd at the food lines.
Food will be eaten on your time. Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you - shamelessly waste my time like this?
I don't know.

I like that. ""I Don't Know."" That's nice.
""Mr. Hand, will I pass this class?"" ""Gee, Mr. Spicoli, I don't know!"" That's nice. I really like that! You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to leave your words on this board for *all* my classes to enjoy, giving you full credit of course, Mr. Spicoli.
All right!
Are you in my class?
I am today.
Those guys are fags.
Awesome! Totally awesome! All right, Hamilton!
Hey, Bud, let's party!
They sold their bodies to medicine for money. About $30, I think.
Twenty-five.
Righteous bucks!
People on 'ludes should not drive!
Hey, wait a minute, there's no birthday party for me here!
Hey, you guys had shirts on when you came in here.
Well, something must have happened to them.
Have you seen the new Playboy?
Good?
Bodacious tits!
Alright.
I like sex!
This gentleman here is named Arthur. Arthur was good enough to die last week of heart failure and we are fortunate enough today to view his body in it's pristine state. Now, here, an incision has been made. The ribs have been sawed off allowing us to remove the breast plate and *really* observe the human organs as they exist in their natural state! Here we have the human lungs. And here is the human heart, which you can see is actually located in the center of your chest.
Oh, gnarly!
Dad says you have to get up
LEAVE ME ALONE!
Dad says you're gonna be late again you butthole!

How's it feel to win, Joe?
I won?
So it's day three. I come across Pen Guans.
I'm Chicken Joe. Joseph. It's long for Joe.
That's cool.
They treat me as their king and put me in their hot tub. I guess their royal hot tub.
It got all hot and steamy. It really opened up my pores.
They even served me food while I was in there. As great as it was, I still had a vision of my quest.
Lani, where's Cody?
Oh, crap!
Oh man, I'm in love.
Help me, I'm drowning.
What are you standing here next to me for? You should go talk to her.
No way, man! I'm not gonna go talk to her.
Dude, she's totally into you! She called you crap!
Whoah! You gotta try this blowhole thing, man! This whale dude is giving me a brain freeze.
I can help, though. Except if there's blood. Just the thought of blood makes me... makes me...
My name's Cody Maverick, Shiverpool. You?
No, I'm not from Shiverpool. Dude, I'm from Lake Michigan. That's where I surf. I was the only one around my town who did it.
Squidito on el stickito?
Butt freeze!
First, I'm gonna take you down. Then I'm gonna fry the chicken.
Whoa! That cloud looks just like a kitten. Aww.
Aren't you worried about being out here in the jungle? Isn't it kinda dangerous?

Cody would never do this.
That's really disrespectful.
I would never do that...
Mm-hm. You just wouldn't make it out of your mouth.

What are you talking about? Robyn Sweeney is mine. She's become a major babe, and she loves me.
She finds you crusty, Dave.
I'll convince her! She'll see the truth.
The truth is bro, life's about greasing the 'do back, buddy, and wheezin' on the buff-fest, man. High school was interesting, alright? It was kinda like a harsh ride. Ah, ah...

We're going on to bigger and better things, buddy!

Matt Wilson? I mean, what a jerk! What does she see in him, anyway?

Look, Dave, you're gonna have to just mellow out, bro, on this whole Robyn thing, she always shines you.
You don't understand; we have history.
Hey, you had history: pre-freshman history. Could've had her back then, man.
She hadn't hit babehood yet!
Stop! Stop, where did you go? You just took off after school. Do you know how worried I've been?
God, Dave, you sound like my Mom.
God, you can't do that to me.

Ya know what, Dave, just Chill, 'cause you know why? Link and I had a Stoney time at the Mountain.
You took him to Mega Mountain? Are you crazy?
Yeah, 'cause they're ridin' The Vapor in reverse.

There's only one rule. Don't touch anything!
Have you ever heard of the tooth fairy?
No.
I wouldn't fall asleep if I were you.
No. Travis you just get out!
You can't talk to me like that.
No, but I can.
Majored in karate for two semesters.
Well, now that that's all settled, I think my future son-in-law should carve the turkey.
Oh well you see, that's not necessary, because Crawl and I were never.
Sure about the wedding date. So we'll just give it some time and see how things go.
Oh that's a hell of an idea. Hell of an idea!
Let's just get the rules straight here. There'll be absolutely no partying in this hall between the hours of 5 and 6 in the morning, without my express written permission. OK cool. Carry on.
My name's Crawl and I'm the RA. And you are? No wait, don't tell me. Sally? Jessie? Raphael?
Where are you from?
South Dakota
Fresh off the farm, oh my God, I can't believe it. Right across the hallway. Hallelujah. So you're inbred?
What?
You know, where your mom's your dad, and your dad's your brother.
You have got charisma!
What's that?
It's a special quality of leadership that captures the popular imagination and inspires allegiance and devotion.
Chickens You guys have chickens? I love chickens! Are they extra crispy or original recipe?

I mean, cruising around Europe, backpacking, right ?

Oh, my God, it's Bartles or James. Dude, which one are you?
What are you wearing?
Cheek-chillers, you likes?
I hates.
Let me guess miss your mom dad, brother, dog, boyfriend. practically everything you can think of back home. Am I right?
Why do they call you Crawl?
Because that's how I used to get home my freshmen year.
You're too late. Yeah, a couple weeks ago at school I already asked Bec to marry me.
Cutting some corn. Cutting some corn. Can I get some butter please?
Hey, hey Becca! Steven Tyler PJs. Steven Tyler PJs.
That's great Crawl.
Rebecca. Rebecca are you listening?
Uhh do you have a screw driver?
Sorry, all out of vodka!
Your PC got harshed, right, 'cause your system heaps at the wrong parameter.
So l toasted the dated directory, tweaked the P-RAM and reglazed your subroutine."
Bud Macintosh,BM,Surfer Dude,"'Scuse me miss. Are you tired?
What?
Are you tired?
No. Why?
'Cause you've been running through my mind all day.
First Frisky now this! All I know is someone's goin' down!
Whoa Doyle! Put the gun down, put the gun down stubs! We don't need evil right now, evil is not good!

What do you guys want out of life?
To die and come back as a leotard.
We have to show the girls that we care about the environment, too.
Do we?
No.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait a minute! You guys aren't one of those freaky cults are you? Y'know, who dance naked and you want us to take off our clothes and feed us special punch?
...No...
Damn! We were so close.
Alright people, stay with the group and remember here at the bio we're dependent on keeping homos balanced within the system!
I propose that we plant these seeds and I know what your thinkin' ""Illegal! Illegal!"" but the value of purple sticky punch goes way beyond just tokin' it!

Lance B. Johnson,BM,Surfer Dude,"Smell that? You smell that?
What?
Napalm, son. Nothing else in the world smells like that.
I love the smell of napalm in the morning. You know, one time we had a hill bombed, for 12 hours. When it was all over, I walked up. We didn't find one of 'em, not one stinkin' dink body. The smell, you know that gasoline smell, the whole hill. Smelled like
victory. Someday this war's gonna end...
Lance! Hey, Lance! What do you think?
It's beautiful!
What's the matter with you? You're acting kinda weird!
Hey, you know that last tab of acid I was saving? I dropped it.

Goddamn it. You stepped in my face.
We thought you were dead.
Well, you thought wrong, damn it."
Katsumoto,BS,Warrior Poet,"You believe a man can change his destiny?
I think a man does what he can, until his destiny is revealed.
The perfect blossom is a rare thing. You could spend your life looking for one, and it would not be a wasted life.
What does it say?
""I belong to the warrior in whom the old ways have joined the new.""
What do you want from me?
What do you want for yourself?
What happened to the warriors at Thermopylae?
Dead to the last man.
Perfect... They are all... perfect...
And who was your general?
Don't you have a rebellion to lead?
People in your country do not like conversation?
He was a lieutenant colonel. His name was Custer.
I know this name. He killed many warriors
Oh, yes. Many warriors.
So he was a good general.
No. No, he wasn't a good general. He was arrogant and foolhardy. And he got massacred because he took a single battalion against two thousand angry Indians.
Two thousand Indians? How many men for Custer?
Two hundred and eleven.
I like this General Custer.
He was a murderer who fell in love with his own legend. And his troopers died for it.
I think this is a very good death.
Well, maybe you can have one just like it someday.
You do not have to die here.
I should have died so many time before.
There is Life in every breath...
That is, Bushido.
I killed her husband?
It was a good death.
The Emperor could not hear my words. His army will come. For nine hundred years, my ancestors have protected our people. Now... I have failed them.
So you will take your own life? In shame? Shame for a life of service? Discipline? Compassion?
The way of the Samurai is not necessary anymore.
Necessary? What could be more necessary?
I will die by the sword. My own, or my enemy's.
Then let it be your enemy's.
What else has she told you?
That you have nightmares.
Every soldier has nightmares.
Only one who is ashamed of what he has done.
You have no idea what I have done.
I have introduced myself. You have introduced yourself. This is a very good conversation.
What do you want?
To know my enemy.
I've seen what you do to your enemies.
The warriors in your country do not kill?
They don't cut the heads off defeated, kneeling men.
General Hasegawa asked me to help him end his life. A samurai cannot stand the shame of defeat. I was honored to cut off his head.
When I took this, you were my enemy.
How's your poem coming?
The end is proving difficult.
You fought against your Red Indians?
Yes.
Tell me of your part in this war.
Why?
I wish to learn.
Read a book.
I would rather have a good conversation.
Good God... Sir, the Imperial Army of Japan demands your surrender. If you and your fellas lay down your arms, you will not be harmed.
This is not possible, as Mr. Omura knows.
Captain Algren. We will show you no quarter. You ride against us, and you're the same as they are.
I'll look for you on the field.
Many of our customs seem strange to you. And the same is true of yours. For example, not to introduce yourself is considered extremely rude, even among enemies.
There was once a battle at a place called Thermopylae, where three hundred brave Greeks held off a Persian army of a million men... a million, you understand this number?
I understand this number.
If I am no use, I will happily end my life.
No, I need your voice in the Council.
It is your voice we need, Highness. You are a living god. Do what you think is right.
I am a living god, as long as I do what *they* think is right.
What sad words you speak.
I have questions.
Questions come later.
Well, they won't surrender.
This is my son's village. We are deep in the mountains, and the winter is coming. You cannot escape.
Jolly Good.
What the hell am I doing here?
In spring the snows will melt and the passes will open. Until that time, you are here.
Uijo is teaching you the way of the Japanese sword.
Yes indeed.
Who sent those men to kill you? Was it the Emperor? Omura?
If The Emperor wishes my death, he has but to ask.
So it was Omura."
Zohan,BS,Warrior Poet,"What are you? Bionic?
No, no, no, no, no, I only like the girls... Thanks anyways.
I just want to make people silky-smooth!
Well Australia, it must be really nice there since they got rid of the apartheid.
Oh yes, the weather is much cooler.
It is... you. Dalia, I don't know how to tell you this. I cannot make sticky with anyone else. *You* are the special one. I will only be ""Steve"" for you.
Uh, who is Steve?
Stiff, with an F.
Young man! Look what I have found here, a nice balloon. Do you want it?
You know, you shouldn't jump around when this nice woman is holding a sharp pair of scissors. If you move she could slip and slice your jugular vein, on accident. There is no way to stitch the jugular. All of your blood will be on the floor in four minutes. I have seen this. I have done this. You don't want this.
Well then, at least it is good time to shave his neck...
It's not that big.
No, not that. The bush, is biggest you ever seen, right?
So let's go.
Zohan! He has a bomb... and puppies!
No!
Imma blow up this whole block, Imma blow you up, Imma blow up these puppies! And we all gone' go to hell together, cause I hate these puppies!
Don't worry! I will lose them!
Nobody's following us!
Unbelievable! This enema gets to live his dream...!
One woman, one zikpah, one life...
And this is your Palestinian wife.
Yes papa.
Does she know you're a faygelah?
Congratulations. Now cut my hair...
Well, tonight's our night for the Community Nightwatch.
The Communism tight crotch? What?
Why you do this? You know I feel no pain.
No no no no no... I feel no pain!"
Colonel Walter E. Kurtz,BS,Warrior Poet,"We train young men to drop fire on people, but their commanders won't allow them to write ""fuck"" on their airplanes because it's obscene!
The horror... the horror...
I've seen horrors... horrors that you've seen. But you have no right to call me a murderer. You have a right to kill me. You have a right to do that... but you have no right to judge me. It's impossible for words to describe what is necessary to those who do not know what horror means. Horror... Horror has a face... and you must make a friend of horror. Horror and moral terror are your friends. If they are not, then they are enemies to be feared. They are truly enemies! I remember when I was with Special Forces... seems a thousand centuries ago. We went into a camp to inoculate some children. We left the camp after we had inoculated the children for polio, and this old man came running after us and he was crying. He couldn't see. We went back there, and they had come and hacked off every inoculated arm. There they were in a pile. A pile of little arms. And I remember... I... I... I cried, I wept like some grandmother. I wanted to tear my teeth out; I didn't know what I wanted to do! And I want to remember it. I never want to forget it... I never want to forget. And then I realized... like I was shot... like I was shot with a diamond... a diamond bullet right through my forehead. And I thought, my God... the genius of that! The genius! The will to do that! Perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline, pure. And then I realized they were stronger than we, because they could stand that these were not monsters, these were men... trained cadres. These men who fought with their hearts, who had families, who had children, who were filled with love... but they had the strength... the strength... to do that. If I had ten divisions of those men, our troubles here would be over very quickly. You have to have men who are moral... and at the same time who are able to utilize their primordial instincts to kill without feeling... without passion... without judgment... without judgment! Because it's judgment that defeats us.
I watched a snail crawl along the edge of a straight razor. That's my dream; that's my nightmare. Crawling, slithering, along the edge of a straight razor... and surviving.
Did they say why, Willard, why they want to terminate my command?
I was sent on a classified mission, sir.
It's no longer classified, is it? Did they tell you?
They told me that you had gone totally insane, and that your methods were unsound.
Are my methods unsound?
I don't see any method at all, sir.
I expected someone like you. What did you expect? Are you an assassin?
I'm a soldier.
You're neither. You're an errand boy, sent by grocery clerks, to collect a bill.
They train young men to drop fire on people. But their commanders won't allow them to write 'fuck' on their airplanes because it is obscene.
Have you ever considered any real freedoms? Freedoms from the opinion of others... even the opinions of yourself?
I worry that my son might not understand what I've tried to be. And if I were to be killed, Willard, I would want someone to go to my home and tell my son everything. Everything I did, everything you saw, because there's nothing that I detest more than the stench of lies. And if you understand me, Willard, you will do this for me.
We must kill them. We must incinerate them. Pig after pig... cow after cow... village after village... army after army...
What do you call it when the assassins accuse the assassin? A lie. A lie and we have to be merciful.
Where are you from, Willard?
I'm from Ohio, sir.
Were you born there?
Yes, sir.
Whereabouts?
Toledo, sir.
How far are you from the river?
The Ohio River, sir?
Uh-huh.
About 200 miles.
I went down that river once when I was a kid. There's a place in that river - I can't remember - must have been a gardenia plantation at one time. It's all wild and overgrown now, but about five miles, you'd think that heaven just fell on the earth in the form of gardenias. Have you considered any real freedoms? Freedoms from the opinions of others. Even the opinions of yourself.
As long as cold beer, hot food, rock 'n' roll, and all the other amenities remain expected norm, our conduct of the war will only gain impotence."
Master Li Mu Bai,BS,Warrior Poet,"I've already wasted my whole life. I want to tell you with my last breath that I have always loved you. I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side as a condemned soul, than enter heaven without you. Because of your love, I will never be a lonely spirit.
No growth without assistance. No action without reaction. No desire without restraint. Now give yourself up and find yourself again.
The things we touch have no permanence. My master would say: there is nothing we can hold onto in this world. Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.
I would rather be a ghost drifting by your side as a condemned soul than enter heaven without you... because of your love, I will never be a lonely spirit
You were enlightened?
No. I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment. Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow.
Crouching tigers and hidden dragons are in the underworld... but so are human feelings.
Like most things, I am nothing.
Real sharpness comes without effort.
She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.
But Wudan does not accept women.
For her, they might make an exception. If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.
Sharpness is a state of mind.
Give yourself up and find yourself again.
What was it?
Something I can't let go of.
Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons, full of corruption.
Even if I was banished to the darkest place, my love will never let me be a lonely spirit.
The Green Destiny Sword. You're giving it to Sir Te.
I am. He has always been our greatest protector.
I don't understand. How can you part with it? It's been with you a long time.
Too many men have died at its edge. It may look pure... , but only because blood washes so easily from its blade.
Why do you want to teach me?
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of the Wudang secrets.
You did your job well. The sword is back. But... This girl. I saw her last night.
I knew you'd be suspicious.
She needs controlling. She needs real direction and training.
You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in stillness.
Why do you want to teach me?
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
And if I use them to kill you?
That's a risk I'm willing to take. Deep down you're good. Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you."
Tool,BS,Warrior Poet,"You remember that time we was up in Bosnia? We took down them Serb bad boys? All our guys were gettin' chopped up all around us and there was blood everywhere. I never though I was gonna make it out of there and I know you didn't and you didn't either. Kinda feelin' like... dead too, ya know? My heads all very, very black place. Didn't believe in shit. Just goddamn Dracula black. I remember I got this bottle of this local shit they have over there. That slivovitz... I think that's what it was called. And I ain't feelin' no pain now... and I come up on this, uh... I come up on this overland bridge, and I see this... I see this... I see this woman standing there, ya know? And she's, uh... I stepped out and she saw me, and she's just lookin' right... right in my eyes. And I was lookin' right in her eyes, and I knew what she was gonna do. She looked at me, and I knew she was gonna jump. You know what I did, man? I just turned around I kept walkin'... until I heard that splash and she was gone. After... after taking all them lives, she was one that I could have saved, but I didn't, and... what I realized later on was if I'd have saved that woman, I might have saved what was left of my soul, ya know?
I promised myself, I'm gonna die for something that counts.
I got a great idea. Why don't you let me doodle, like, a Charlotte's web on your head? On the top of your head. You know, something different, something exciting. 'Cause you got one of them perfectly shaped domed, muscular heads. I could put a web on the top of the head. Maybe a pregnant Charlotte coming out of your ear, peeking around, making sure them bugs don't come inside. Her long legs dangling down your neck. Yeah. Sexy, right?
Very sexy. He looks thrilled.
It's Christmastime.
Yeah, I can smell him from here."
T. E. Lawrence,BS,Warrior Poet,"Ooh! It damn well 'urts!
Certainly it hurts.
What's the trick then?
The trick, William Potter, is not minding that it hurts.
I killed two people. One was... yesterday? He was just a boy and I led him into quicksand. The other was... well, before Aqaba. I had to execute him with my pistol, and there was something about it that I didn't like.
That's to be expected.
No, something else.
Well, then let it be a lesson.
No... something else.
What then?
I enjoyed it.
What is it, Major Lawrence, that attracts you personally to the desert?
It's clean.
There may be honor among thieves, but there's none in politicians.
Have you no fear, English?
My fear is my concern.
Gasim's time has come, Lawrence. It is written.
Nothing is written.
You will not be at Aqaba, English! Go back, blasphemer... but you will not be at Aqaba!
I shall be at Aqaba. That, IS written.
In here.
So long as the Arabs fight tribe against tribe, so long will they be a little people, a silly people - greedy, barbarous, and cruel, as you are.
My friends, we have been foolish. Auda will not come to Aqaba. Not for money...
No.
...for Feisal...
No!
...nor to drive away the Turks. He will come... because it is his pleasure.
Thy mother mated with a scorpion.
I say, Lawrence. You are a clown!
Ah, well, we can't all be lion tamers.
What is your name?
My name is for my friends. None of my friends is a murderer!
Are you badly hurt?
I'm not hurt at all. Didn't you know? They can only kill me with a golden bullet.
Lawrence, only two kinds of creature get fun in the desert: Bedouins and gods, and you're neither. Take it from me, for ordinary men, it's a burning, fiery furnace.
No, Dryden, it's going to be fun.
It is recognized that you have a funny sense of fun.
You will cross Sinai?
Moses did!
And you will take the children?
Moses did!
Moses was a prophet and beloved of God!
Is that a desert country?
No: a fat country. Fat people.
You are not fat?
No. I'm different.
I can't make out whether you're bloody bad-mannered or just half-witted.
I have the same problem, sir.
My lord, I think... I think your book is right. 'The desert is an ocean in which no oar is dipped' and on this ocean the Bedu go where they please and strike where they please. This is the way the Bedu have always fought. You're famed throughout the world for fighting in this way and this is the way you should fight now!
I do not understand this. Your father's name is Chapman...
Ali, he didn't marry my mother.
I see.
I'm sorry.
It seems to me that you are free to choose your own name, then.
Michael George Hartley, this is a nasty, dark little room.
That's right.
We are not happy in it.
It's better than a nasty, dark little trench.
Then you're an ignoble fellow.
That's right.
It's my manner, sir.
Your manner?
Yes. It looks insubordinate, but it isn't really.
Shut up... and get out!
We do not work this thing for Feisal.
No? For the English, then?
For the Arabs.
The Arabs? The Howitat, Ajili, Rala, Beni Saha; these I know, I have even heard of the Harif, but the Arabs? What tribe is that?
Never saw a man killed with a sword before.
Why don't you take a picture?
Wish I had.
The English have a great hunger for desolate places. I fear they hunger for Arabia.
Then you must deny it to them.
You are an Englishman. Are you not loyal to England?
To England and to other things.
To England and Arabia both? And is that possible? I think you are another of these desert-loving English.
The Law says the man must die... If he dies, would that content the Howitat?
Yes.
Sherif Ali. If none of lord Auda's men harms any of yours, will that content the Harith?
Yes.
Then I will execute the Law. I have no tribe and no one is offended.
You acted without orders, you know.
Shouldn't officers use their initiative at all times?
Not really. It's awfully dangerous.
I believe your name will be a household word when you'll have to go to the War Museum to find who Allenby was. You're the most extraordinary man I've ever met!
Leave me alone!
What?
Leave me alone!
Well, that's a feeble thing to say.
I know I'm not ordinary.
That's not what I'm saying...
All right! I'm extraordinary! What of it?
But you know, Lieutenant, in the Arab city of Cordoba were two miles of public lighting in the streets when London was a village?
Yes, you were great.
Nine centuries ago.
Time to be great again, my lord.
No prisoners! No prisoners!
The truth is: I'm an ordinary man. You might've told me that, Dryden.
What are you looking for?
Some way to announce myself.
Be patient with him, God.
This is a bar for British officers!
That's all right. We're not particular.
Here you may drink...
One cup.
You do not drink?
No.
I'll drink when you do.
I am *Bedu*.
There is the railway. And that is the desert. From here until we reach the other side, no water but what we carry with us. For the camels, no water at all. If the camels die, we die. And in twenty days they will start to die.
There's no time to waste, then, is there?
I pray that I may never see the desert again. Hear me, God.
I cannot fiddle but I can make a great state of a small city.
Well, General, I will leave you. Major Lawrence doubtless has reports to make upon my people and their weakness, and the need to keep them weak in the British interest... and the French interest too, of course. We must not forget the French now...
I've told you, sir, no such treaty exists.
Yes, General, you have lied most bravely, but not convincingly. I know this treaty does exist.
Treaty, sir?
He does it better than you, General. But then, of course, he is almost an Arab.
The best of them won't come for money; they'll come for me.
I have been stationed in Dara for three and a half years. If I were posted to the dark side of the moon I could not be more isolated. You don't have the slightest idea what I'm talking about, do you?
No, effendi.
Do you? No. That would be too... lucky.
A thousand Arabs means a thousand knives, delivered anywhere day or night. It means a thousand camels. That means a thousand packs of high explosives and a thousand crack rifles. We can cross Arabia while Johnny Turk is still turning round, and smash his railways. And while he's mending them, I'll smash them somewhere else. In thirteen weeks, I can have Arabia in chaos.
I fight like Clausewitz, then you fight like Saxe!
We should do very well, then, shouldn't we?
What about your Arab friends? What about them?
I have no Arab friends. I don't want Arab friends !
What in Hell do you want, Lawrence?
I told you! I just want my ration of common humanity.
Lawrence!
Nothing. Sorry I interrupted, Sir.
Quite all right. Thank you, Mr Dryden. Look, why don't we, er... There's blood on your back. Do you want a Doctor ?
God help the men that lie under that.
They are Turks.
God help them.
I'm to ""assess the situation"".
Hmph! Well that won't be too difficult. The situation's bloody awful.
Where are they now?
Anywhere within 300 miles of Medina. They're Hashemite Bedouins. They can cross 60 miles of desert in a day.
Oh,thanks Dryden. This is going to be fun.
Lawrence, only two kinds of creature get fun in the desert: Beduins and gods, and you're neither. Take it from me. For ordinary men, it's a burning fiery furnace.
No,Dryden. It's going to be fun.
It is recognised that you have a funny sense of fun.
To be great again, it seems that we need the english... or...
Or?
What no man can provide, Mr. Lawrence. We need a miracle.
Look, Ali. If any of your Beduin arrived in Cairo and said: ""We've taken Aqaba"" the generals would laugh.
I see. In Cairo you will put off these funny clothes. You'll wear trousers and tell stories of our quaintness and barbarity and then they will believe you.
You're an ignorant man.
I'm promoting you Major.
I don't think that's a very good idea.
No, they're still there, but they've no boots. Prisoners, sir. We took them prisoners; the entire garrison. No, that's not true. We killed some; too many really. I'll manage it better next time. There's been a lot of killing, one way or another. Cross my heart and hope to die, it's all perfectly true.
Where did you get this wound?
That is old, effendi.
No, it is recent. You are a deserter. But from which army? Not that it matters at all. A man can't always be in uniform.
You are an Englishman. Are you not loyal to England?
To England, and to other things.
Aurens! Can you pass for an Arab in an Arab town?
If one of you will lend me some dirty clothes.
Well, sir, going home!
Mm?
Home, sir!
Lord, can we not rest?
I told you, no rest till they know that I have Aqaba... Have you two slept in beds? Farraj? Daud? With sheets?
Tomorrow the finest sheets in the finest room, in the finest hotel in Cairo. I promise.
Then it shall be so, Lord.
He is dead.
yes... why?
this is my well.
I have drunk from it.
You are welcome.
He was my friend.
That?
Yes, that.
This pistol yours?
No, his.
His?
Mine.
hen i will use it.
... your friend... was a Hazimi of the Beni Salem.
I know.
I am Ali ibn el Kharish.
I have heard of you.
So... What was a Hazimi doing here?
He was taking me to help Prince Feisal.
You've been sent from Cairo?
Yes.
I have been in Cairo for my schooling. I can both read and write... my Lord Feisal already has an Englishman.
Yes.
What is your name?
My name is for my friend.
None of my friends is a murderer.
You are angry, English.
He was nothing. The well is everything... The Hazimi may not drink at our wells. He knew that... Salaam.
Sherif Ali!. So long as the Arabs fight tribe against tribe, so long will they be a little people, a silly people. Greedy, barbarous and cruel, as you are.
Come. I will take you to Feisal.
I do not want your company, sherif.
Wadi Safra is another day from here. You will not find it, and not finding it you will die.
I will find it with this.
Good army compass. How if I take it?
Then you would be a thief.
Have you no fear, English?
My fear is my concern.
Truly.
God be with you English.
Do you think I'm just anybody, Ali? Do you?
I've been waiting for you.
Did you know I was coming?
I knew someone was coming. I mean Feisal told me.
How did he know?
Not much happens within 50 miles of Feisal that Feisal doesn't know. I'll give him that... no escort?
My guide was killed at the Masturah well.
Turks?
No, an Arab.
Bloody savages.
Cross my heart and hope to die, it's all perfectly true.
Not many people have a destiny Lawrence. It's a terrible thing for a man to funk it if he has.
You're speaking from experience?
No.
You're guessing then."
Horton the Elephant,BS,Warrior Poet,"A person's a person, no matter how small.
I meant what I said and I said what I meant. An elephant's faithful one hundred percent.
I have 96 daughters and 1 son.
Whoa! Busy guy.
This entire jungle is a house of death!
I meant what I said, and I said what I meant.
An elephant's faithful one hundred percent.
That's my code, my motto.
This is the chairman...
Idiot! You're finished in this town! Is that understood? Finished! You Boob!
I'm just joking.
Eh heh, good one.
Horton, I'd like you to meet my wife, Sally.
You exist! This means my husband isn't crazy. Hooray!
And these are some of my daughters, Hildy, Helga, Hula, Heidi, and Hedy.
, , , :
Hi!
, , , :
Hi!
, , , :
Hi!
, , , :
Hi!
And this is Miss Yelp, my loyal assistant. And this is Dr. Larue.
You saved us!
And Burt from Accounting, and Mrs. McGillicuddy. And Mr. FarFloogin of the Cloogin FarFloogins. And the old man in the bathtub.
Honey, let's not overwhelm the poor guy, he's never gonna remember all these names.
Well, I'll try my best: Sally, Chairman, Hildy, Helga, Hula, Heidi, and Hedy. Miss Yelp. Dr. Larue, Burt from accounting, Mrs. McGillicuddy, Mr. FarFloogin of the Cloogin FarFloogins. And wasn't there an old guy in a shower?
Mmm, Bathtub.
Oh, Yeah!
I'll make monkeys out of these monkeys!
Horton, the kangaroo has sent Vlad!
Vlad? Vlad, Vlad... I know two Vlads. There's the bad Vlad... And then there's bunny Vlad, the one that makes cookies!
...Yeah, Horton, she's sending you a bunny with cookies. I think it's safe to say it's the bad Vlad.
Yeah, good call.
And Morton, for being the only one who stood by me. Well not right by me; he hid in the bushes sending me good thoughts. He's small.
Dude, you are a warrior poet.
We must become invisible, travel silently, for there are forces that would seek to destroy us.
Ahaha! To the top of Mount Nool, as fast as lightning, away I go!
All right, I gotta get this speck up to the top of Mount Nool A.S.A.P, whatever that means, probably 'act swiftly, awesome pachyderm'! I mean, how hard can that be?
This looks kinda... precarious. Well nothing to worry, obviously when they build a bridge like this they take into account that elephants will be crossing here.
Sorry, this is where we get off.
Cool line, usually I can't think of those things until later.
I will make monkeys of these monkeys, for it is their destiny!
Whoa! I can feel the diplomatic processes beginning to break down!
We're a club. We're a group. We can take a vote on the issues. We can be a secret society, and no one else can join, unless they wear a funny hat!
There's a tiny person on that speck that needs my help!
Listen, Horton, I've gotta go. Apparently there's a problem with a giant meatball.
You just take care of that meatball sir and leave the freaking out to me.
What do you think you're doing?
Oh, you guys with worlds are in trouble!
Have you forgotten what we've discussed?
Oh no, I'm an elephant and elephants never forget, it's a curse really! I remember, I was on my head and you said hmm and I looked up and you said ,what are you doing?, and I said the thing about the speck, then you pulled my ears and you poked me in the forehead...
Horton!
Well you did.
It's just a straight plummet to certain death.
I have to think light. I'm light as a feather. I am light as a feather.
Heavy feather.
Is everything okay down there?
Uh... I don't know. You tell me. You're the one holding the speck.
Listen, *please*! It's the most beautiful thing ever!
I don't hear nothin'.
Alright, I need to get this clover to the top of Mount Nool A.S.A.P.whatever that means. Probably, Act Swiftly, Awesome Pachyderm.
. It's a sheer drop to certain death."
Dilios,BK,Storyteller,"Dilios, I trust that ""scratch"" hasn't made you useless.
Hardly, my lord, it's just an eye. The gods saw fit to grace me with a spare.
""Goodbye my love."" He doesn't say it. There's no room for softness... not in Sparta. No place for weakness. Only the hard and strong may call themselves Spartans. Only the hard, only the strong.
""Remember us."" As simple an order as a king can give. ""Remember why we died."" For he did not wish tribute, nor song, nor monuments nor poems of war and valor. His wish was simple. ""Remember us,"" he said to me. That was his hope, should any free soul come across that place, in all the countless centuries yet to be. May all our voices whisper to you from the ageless stones, ""Go tell the Spartans, passerby, that here by Spartan law, we lie.""
Immortals... we put their name to the test.
His helmet was stifling, it narrowed his vision. And he must see far. His shield was heavy. It threw him off balance. And his target is far away.
Immortals... they fail our king's test. And a man who fancies himself a god feels a very human chill crawl up his spine.
It's been more than thirty years since the wolf and the winter cold. And now, as then, it is not fear that grips him, only restlessness. A heightened sense of things. The seaborn breeze, coolly, kissing the sweat at his chest and neck. Gulls cawing, complaining, even as they feast on the thousands of floating dead. The steady breathing of the 300 at his back, ready to die for him without a moment's pause. Everyone of them ready, to die.
The captain's cries of pain at the loss of his son are more frightening to the enemy than the deepest battle drums. It takes three men to restrain him and bring him back to our own.
And so my king died, and my brothers died, barely a year ago. Long I pondered my king's cryptic talk of victory. Time has proven him wise, for from free Greek to free Greek, the word was spread that bold Leonidas and his three hundred, so far from home, laid down their lives. Not just for Sparta, but for all Greece and the promise this country holds.
Now, here on this ragged patch of earth called Plataea, Xerxes's hordes face obliteration!
HA-OOH!
Just there the barbarians huddle, sheer terror gripping tight their hearts with icy fingers... knowing full well what merciless horrors they suffered at the swords and spears of three hundred. Yet they stare now across the plain at *ten thousand* Spartans commanding thirty thousand free Greeks! HA-OOH!
HA-OOH! HA-OOH! HA-OOH!
The enemy outnumber us a paltry three to one, good odds for any Greek. This day we rescue a world from mysticism and tyranny and usher in a future brighter than anything we can imagine.
Give thanks, men, to Leonidas and the brave 300! TO VICTORY!
We did what we were trained to do, what we were bred to do, what we were born to do!
Hundreds leave, a handful stay. Only one looks back.
Sire, any message...?
For the Queen?
None that need be spoken.
The old ones say we Spartans are descended from Hercules himself. Bold Leonidas gives testament to our bloodline. His roar is long and loud.
They have served the dark will of Persian kings for five hundred years. Eyes as dark as night... teeth filed to fangs... soulless. The personal guard to King Xerxes himself; the Persian warrior elite. The deadliest fighting force in all of Asia... the Immortals.
Taught never to retreat, never to surrender. Taught that death on the battlefield in service to Sparta was the greatest glory he could achieve in his life.
The god-king has betrayed a fatal flaw: Hubris. Easy to taunt, easy to trick. Before wounds and weariness have taken their toll, the mad king throws the best he has at us. Xerxes has taken the bait.
It's been more than thirty years since the wolf and the winter cold. And now, as then, a beast approaches; patient and confident, savoring the meal to come. This beast is made of men and horses, swords and spears. An army of slaves vast beyond imagining, ready to devour tiny Greece, ready to snuff out the world's one hope for reason and justice. A beast approaches.
The Ephors choose only the most beautiful Spartan girls to live among them as oracles. Their beauty is their curse. For the old wretches have the needs of men... and souls as black as hell.
Those behind cry, ""FORWARD!"" Those in front cry, ""BACK!""
When the boy was born, like all Spartans, he was inspected.
Xerxes dispatches his monsters from half the world away. They're clumsy beasts, and the piled Persian dead are slippery."
Ed Bloom - Young,BK,Storyteller,"It was that night I discovered that most things you consider evil or wicked are simply lonely, and lacking in the social niceties.
You don't even know me.
I have the rest of my life to find out.
You don't know me but my name is Edward Bloom and I love you.
There are some fish that cannot be caught. It's not that they are faster or stronger than other fish, they're just touched by something extra.
I don't want to eat you. I just get so hungry. I'm just too big.
Did you ever think that maybe you're not too big, but maybe this town is just too small?
Sandra Templeton, I love you and I WILL marry you.
It occurred to me then, that perhaps the reason for my growth was I was intended for larger things. After all, a giant man can't have an ordinary-sized life.
There comes a point when any reasonable man will swallow his pride and admit he made a mistake. The truth is... I was never a reasonable man.
Didn't kill anything, did I?
A couple of rabbits, but I think one of 'em was already dead.
That would explain the indigestion.
She said that the biggest fish in the river gets that way by never getting caught.
I've been working on this poem for 12 years.
Really?
There's a lot of expectation. I don't wanna disappoint my fans.
May I?
The grass so green Skies so blue. Spectre is really great!
It's only three lines long.
This is why you should never show a work in progress.
I just saw the woman I'm going to marry. I know it. But I lost her.
Oh, tough break. Well, most men have to get married *before* they lose their wives.
I'm gonna spend every day for the rest of my life looking for her. That, or die alone!
Damn, kid. Lemme guess. Real pretty? Reddish-blondish hair? Blue dress?
Yeah!
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
Who is she? Where does she live?
Forget it kid, don't waste your time. She's out of your league.
What do you mean? You don't even know me.
Sure I do! You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat! You don't have a plan, you don't have a job, you don't have anything except the clothes on your back.
Now I may not have much, but I have more determination then any man you're ever likely to meet.
Your last name is different. You married.
I was 18, he was 28. Turns out it was a big difference.
And what I recall of Sunday school was that the more difficult something became, the more rewarding it was in the end.
She likes music.
Music. She likes music.
I haven't seen a customer this depressed since the elephant sat on that farmer's wife!

Depressed?
See, the big guy likes it.
I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, and I lost her.
There's leaches in there.
Did you see that woman?
What did she look like?
Well, she was, uh...
Was she naked?
Yeah, she was.
It's not a woman. It's a fish. No one ever catches her.
The biggest fish in the river gets that way by never getting caught.
There are some fish that cannot be caught. It's not that they're faster or stronger than other fish. They're just touched by something extra.
This isn't how I die.
Promise me you'll come back
I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to.
As soon as my bones had settled in their adult configuration, I set upon my plan to make a bigger place for myself in Ashton.
Edward Bloom!
I was the biggest thing Ashton had ever seen. Until one day, a stranger arrived.
With my prospects few, I took a job as a traveling salesman. It suited me. If there's one thing you can say about Edward Bloom, it's that I'm a social person.
You don't know me, but my name's Edward Bloom... And I love you.
Her favorite flower is daffodils
Daffodils.
Who are you?
Please, I'm not going to hurt you.
Damn right you're not! GUARD!
I can't go back, I'm a human sacrifice.
And now what are you doing?
I'm robbin' this place!
Friend, what happened to your shoes?
They kinda got ahead of me."
Garth McCann,BK,Storyteller,"Hey, who do you think you are, huh?
Just a dumb kid, Hub. Don't kill him.
Right.
I'm Hub McCann. I've fought in two World Wars and countless smaller ones on three continents. I led thousands of men into battle with everything from horses and swords to artillery and tanks. I've seen the headwaters of the Nile, and tribes of natives no white man had ever seen before. I've won and lost a dozen fortunes, KILLED MANY MEN and loved only one woman with a passion a FLEA like you could never begin to understand. That's who I am. NOW, GO HOME, BOY!
The Sheik *knew* that he would sure die now, without even the right to beg for mercy... But Hub just said ""Twice I have held your life in my hands. And twice I have given it back to you. The next time...""
Your life is mine!
Why not see what he's sellin'?
What the hell for?
Well what's the good of having all that money if you're never gonna spend it?
Could be the kid has a point.
Well. We'll see what the man's sellin'. THEN we'll shoot him.
Good plan.
Look, we don't know nothing about children, so if you need something...
-find it yourself. Better yet: learn to do with out.
WE'RE OLD, DAMNIT! LEAVE US ALONE!
The last thing we need is some little sissy boy hanging around all summer
Is it okay if I go inside and watch television?
Ain't got one.
No television?
Salesman should be by in about three, four hours.
Whoop-de-do.
What's wrong with him?
Well, a man's body may grow old, but inside his spirit can still be as young and as restless as ever.
And him - in his day, he had more spirit than twenty men.
Hey! You, in the crate! Get your lion butt outta there!
What happened to her?
Looks like her heart gave out in all the excitement. She was plenty old, you know.
Look, I think she's smiling.
I guess she died happy.
She died with her boots on, that's the main thing.
Protecting her cub.
She was a real lion, wasn't she, there at the end? A real jungle lion. A real Africa lion.
That's SOME lion you bought.
Huh. SOME garden seeds YOU bought!"
Wendy Darling,BK,Storyteller,"Who the bloody hell am I?
You can go feel this way for yourself as long as you want, kid. But knowing where you're from, that's half of knowing who you are - that's more than what most of us here will ever know! At least you know where you've come from. Born to a warrior, heir to a prince, does that mean you're the One? I don't know. I don't know if there is a One. I do know that if you aren't the guy, and you're just you, maybe that's enough.
But you said... that your mother left you.
Yeah. I lied. I do that sometimes.It's called being a grown-up!
If I'm going to trust you, I need to know your name!
It's Hook! The name's James Hook!
So pirates are afraid of Mermaid Lagoon?
Because of crocodiles.
Afraid?
Holy pootie!
Think a happy thought!
Have you come to kill me, Peter?
I don't believe in bedtime stories.
Now kneel!
I will never bow to you!
Why would you want to leave a place like this? Where will you go?
I don't know. somewhere i'm a litle higher up on the food chain, for starters.
What was that?
Something a little higher up on the food chain.
Well always be friends, Hook. Won't we?
Always. What could possibly go wrong?
Which way should we go?
, :

Set a course!
, :

Set a course!
Hey! Who's in charge here?
Well, I'm the captain.
And I'm the chosen one.
We'll have plenty of time to argue about that later, flyboy.
Suit yourself, Captain Hook.
Set a course! Second to the right, and straight on till morning.
Neverland!
Do you know how to work a ship?
How hard can it be?
This is a lot harder than it looks! We're sailing now!
I am going to tell you a story about a boy who would never grow up. About the pirate who wished to kill him. About the island where fairies roamed. But this isn't the story you've heard before, because sometimes friends begin as enemies, and enemies begin as friends. Sometimes to truly understand how things end, we must first know how they begin.
Always be friends, Hook. Are we?
Always. It can't possibly go wrong.
Is this Canada?
Be brave, Peter.
I tried to be."
Ben Bradlee,BO,The Editor,"You know the results of the latest Gallup Poll? Half the country never even heard of the word Watergate. Nobody gives a shit. You guys are probably pretty tired, right? Well, you should be. Go on home, get a nice hot bath. Rest up... 15 minutes. Then get your asses back in gear. We're under a lot of pressure, you know, and you put us there. Nothing's riding on this except the, uh, first amendment to the Constitution, freedom of the press, and maybe the future of the country. Not that any of that matters, but if you guys fuck up again, I'm going to get mad. Goodnight.
Then can we use their names?
No.
Goddammit, when is somebody going to go on the record in this story? You guys are about to write a story that says the former Attorney General, the highest-ranking law enforcement officer in this country, is a crook! Just be sure you're right.
Where's the goddamn story?
The money's the key to whatever this is.
Says who?
Deep Throat.
Who?
Oh, that's Woodward's garage freak; his source in the executive department.
Garage Freak? Jesus, what kind of a crazy fucking story is this? Who did you say?
He's on deep background, I call him deep... throat.
All non-denial denials. They doubt our ancestry, but they don't say the story isn't accurate.
It's a dangerous story for this paper.
How dangerous?
Well, it's not that we're using nameless sources that bothers me. Or that everything we print, the White House denies. Or that no other papers are reprinting our stuff.
What then?
Look, there are two thousand reporters in this town, are there five on Watergate? When did the Washington Post suddenly get the monopoly on wisdom? Why would the Republicans do it? McGovern's self-destructed just like Humphrey, Muskie, the bunch of them. I don't believe this story. It doesn't make sense.
Please, listen, now, if you're going to refer to that alleged conversation with Sally Aiken, you can't print that it took place in her apartment. I have a wife and a family and a dog and a cat.
A wife and a family and a dog and a cat. Right, Ken, right, yeah. Uh, Ken, I don't want to print that you were in Sally's apartment...
Thank God.
I just want to know what you said, in Sally's apartment.
You tell your publisher, tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big wringer if that's published.
He really said that about Mrs. Graham?

Well, I'd cut the words ""her tit"" and print it.
Why?
This is a family newspaper.
Now hold it, hold it. We're about to accuse Haldeman, who only happens to be the second most important man in this country, of conducting a criminal conspiracy from inside the White House. It would be nice if we were right.
How much can you tell me about Deep Throat?
How much do you need to know?
Do you trust him?
Yeah.
I can't do the reporting for my reporters, which means I have to trust them. And I hate trusting anybody. Run that baby.
Bernstein, are you sure on this story?
Absolutely.
Woodward?
I'm sure.
I'm not. It still seems thin.
Get another source.
Look, McGovern's dropped to nothing, Nixon's guaranteed the renomination, the Post is stuck with a story no one else wants, it'll sink the goddamn paper. Everyone says, ""Get off it, Ben"", and I come on very sage and I say, uh, ""Well, you'll see, you wait till this bottoms out."" But the truth is, I can't figure out WHAT we've got.
We haven't had any luck yet.
Get some.
*Woodstein*...!"
Walter Burns,BO,The Editor,"Aiding an escaped criminal and a little charge of kidnapping.
Well, looks like about ten years a piece for you two birds.
Does it?
If you think you've got The Morning Post licked it's time for you to get out of town.
Whistling in the dark. Well that isn't going to help you this time. You're through.
Listen the last man that said that to me was Archie Leach just a week before he cut his throat.
He looks like that fellow in the movies - Ralph Bellamy.
You've got an old fashioned idea divorce is something that lasts forever, 'til death do us part.' Why divorce doesn't mean anything nowadays, Hildy, just a few words mumbled over you by a judge.
I suppose I proposed to you?
Well, you practically did, making goo-goo eyes at me for two years until I broke down.
""Oh, Walter."" And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed to you. If you had been a gentleman, you would have forgotten all about it. But not you!
Why, you - !
You're losing your eye. You used to be able to pitch better than that.
Take Hitler and stick him on the funny page.
Look, Hildy, I only acted like any husband that didn't want to see his home broken up.
What home?
""What home""? Don't you remember the home I promised you?
There's been a lamp burning in the window for ya, honey... here.
Oh, I jumped out that window a long time ago.
Sorta wish you hadn't done that, Hildy.
Done what?
Divorced me. Makes a fella lose all faith in himself. Gives him a... almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.
Oh, now look, junior... that's what divorces are FOR!
He treats me like a woman.
Oh he does, does he? Mm-hm... how did I treat you? Like a water buffalo?
What? A strike? What strike? Where? Albany? Well, I know it's on the way, Duffy, but I can't ask Hildy to...
All right, we'll honeymoon in Albany.
Okay, Duffy.
Well, isn't that a coincidence, we're going to Albany! I wonder if Bruce can put us up.
Oh and I see you've got your rubbers too, always good to be prepared for anything.
Diabetes! I ought to know better than to hire anybody with a disease.
What do you think I am, a crook?
Yes.
Bruce, I, uh... let me get this straight. I must have misunderstood you. You mean you're taking the sleeper today and then getting married tomorrow?
Oh, well, it's not like that.
Well, what's it like?
Poor Walter. He'll toss and turn all night. Perhaps we better tell him Mother's coming along, too.
Mother? Why, your mother kicked the bucket!
No, my mother, my mother.
Oh, your mother. Oh, well, that relieves my mind.
It was cruel of us to let you suffer that way.
Isn't Walter sweet? Always wanting to protect me.
Well Butch, where are you?... Well, what are you doing there? Haven't you even started?... Listen, it's a matter of life and death!... Well, you can't stop for a dame now! I don't care if you've been after her for six years. Butch - our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through?... Butch, I'd put my arm in fire for you, up to here. Now you can't double-cross me... Put her on, I'll talk to her.
Oh, good evening madam. Now listen, you ten-cent glamour girl. You can't keep Butch away from his duty!... What's that?... You say that again, I'll come over there and kick you in the teeth!... Say, what kind of language is that? Now look here you. -
She hung up! What did I say?
Walter!
What?
The mayor's first wife, what was her name?
You mean the one with the wart on her?
Right.
Fanny!
What were you when you came here five years ago - a little college girl from a school of journalism. I took a doll-faced hick...
Well, you wouldn't take me if I hadn't been doll-faced.
Well, why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.
Listen, you insignificant, square-toed, pimpled-headed spy.
Hey, Duffy, listen. Is there any way we can stop the 4:00 train to Albany from leaving town?
We might dynamite it.
Could we?
Oh, you're losing your arm! You used to be able to pitch better than that.
All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Krupsky. You don't deny that, do you Walter?
Deny it? I'm proud of it. We beat the whole country on that story.
Well, suppose we did. That isn't what I got married for!
Well well... how long is it?
How long is what?
You know what... how long is it since we've seen each other?
Let's see this paragon! Is he as good as you say?
Why, he's better!
Well then, what does he want with you?
Ah-ha-ha, now you got me!
Madam, you are a cock-eyed liar!
You've got the brain of a pancake. This isn't just a story you're covering - it's a revolution. This is the greatest yarn in journalism since Livingstone discovered Stanley.
It's the other way around.
Oh, well, don't get technical at a time like this.
We've been in worse jams than this, haven't we, Hildy?
Nope.
What does he look like?
He looks like that fellow in the movies. You know... Ralph Bellamy."
Chico,BT,Young Gun,"Ah, that was the greatest shot I've ever seen.
The worst! I was aiming at the horse.
Villages like this they make up a song about every big thing that happens. Sing them for years.
You think it's worth it?
Don't you?
It's only a matter of knowing how to shoot a gun. Nothing big about that.
Hey. How can you talk like this? Your gun has got you everything you have. Isn't that true? Hmm? Well, isn't that true?
Yeah, sure. Everything. After awhile you can call bartenders and faro dealers by their first name - maybe two hundred of 'em! Rented rooms you live in - five hundred! Meals you eat in hash houses - a thousand! Home - none! Wife - none! Kids... none! Prospects - zero. Suppose I left anything out?
Yeah. Places you're tied down to - none. People with a hold on you - none. Men you step aside for - none.
Insults swallowed - none. Enemies - none.
No enemies?
Alive.
Well. This is the kind of arithmetic I like.
Yeah. So did I at your age.
But who made us the way we are, huh? Men with guns. Men like Calvera, and men like you... and now me.
They're afraid. She's afraid of me, you, him. All of us. Farmers! Their families told them we would rape them.
Well we might. But in my opinion you might have given us the benefit of the doubt. But just as you please...
Thank you, thank you... you... chickens!
And who made us the way we are? Men with guns! Men like Calvera... and you... and now me.
Bring them in.
What for? Let Calvera find them, he'll take good care of them."
Morgan Earp,BT,Young Gun,"Remember what I said about people seein' a bright light before they die? It ain't true. I can't see a damn thing.
What the hell kinda town is this?
Nice scenery.
Well, an enchanted moment.
Interesting little scene. I wonder who that tall drink of water is.
My dear, you've set your gaze upon the quintessential frontier type. Note the lean silhouette... eyes closed by the sun, though sharp as a hawk. He's got the look of both predator and prey.
I want one.
Happy hunting.
It said that a lot of people, when they die, they see this light. Like in a tunnel. They say it's the light leadin' you to heaven.
Really? Well, what about hell? They got a sign there or what?
Look at all the stars. You look up and you think, ""God made all this and He remembered to make a little speck like me."" It's kind of flattering, really.
What in the hell are you doin'? I told you we weren't gettin' involved!
You got us involved when you brought us here.
Now you hold on a minute, Virg!
Hold on nothin'! I walk around this town and look these people in the eyes. It's just like someone's slappin' me in the face! These people are afraid to walk down the street, and I'm tryin' to make money off that like some goddamn vulture! If we're gonna have a future in this town, it's gotta have some law and order!
Don't do this to me!
It's got nothin' to do with you! It's got to do wi...
Nothin' to do with me? I'm your brother, for Christ's sake! God, I don't believe this!
Talk to him, will you? Or hit him!
Ah, God, don't tell me!
Like you said, Wyatt, we're brothers. Gotta back your brother's play. Just did like I figured you would."
Colorado Ryan,BT,Young Gun,"Got any new men with you, Pat?
Nah, nobody 'cept Colorado, here.
Where'd you take him on?
Fort Worth
What does he do?
I speak English, sheriff. If you wanna ask me.
I told him you were one of the best.
Well, I'll tell you what I'm a lot better at, Mr. Wheeler... that's minding my own business.
How'd you come out with Burdette?
He wanted to talk to his brother.
What'd he have to say?
Nothing.
You mean he didn't say anything?
Why are you so interested?
Because he's talkin' now. Hear that music? He told the man to play it.
What is it?
Well, they call it the ""Degüello""... the cutthroat song. The Mexicans played it for those Texas boys when they had 'em bottled up in the Alamo.
Yeah.
Played it day and night 'til it was all over. Now do you know what he means by it?
No quarter. No mercy for the loser.
You'll be hearin' a lot of it.
I guess we made him talk after all."
Tom Sawyer,BT,Young Gun,"Now, would you like to learn to shoot?
I can already.
Oh, I saw. Very American. Fire enough bullets and hope to hit the target.
Well, we were the faster, but now we're the tortoise to his hare.
So, we're done?
No, we're alive. If M has any idea to the contrary, that gives us an edge.
The sea is vast, he could be anywhere.
Yeah, well, I'm an optimist, now maybe that's a crime to you twisted so-and-so's but it keeps me from going crazy.
Your optimism's out of place.
You're wrong! Because we'll get out, man... at least, I will. That other agent I told you about... was my childhood friend. We were agents together until the Fantom shot him dead. Now you can be done, but I am not. I will avenge his death.
It's not about any one of us, Tom, it's bigger than that.
Yes, it is, Jekyll! The fate for the world is in our hands... the world! So M tricked you, he brought you all together and you walked straight into his trap. But the way that I see it, that's the part he did wrong... He brought you together.
He has a point.
And the boy becomes a man... perhaps a leader of men.
And Women.
I'm an immortal, sir, not a gazelle. How can we outrun this?
Care for a spin?
What is it?
The sound of treachery.
He's afraid.
I don't smell anything.
Look out!
Eyes open, boy. I can't protect you all the time!
Boy. They told me European women had funny ways.
Chilao!
Aim.
That's easy.
Adjust for wind and target movement.
That's easy, too.
Here's the part that's not. You have to feel the shot. Take your time with it. You have all the time you need. All the time in the world.
The Phantom is M. And the hunt is still on.
What are you talking about?
The Phantom is M. The same man who recruited us.
Let me see that.
But how?
We'll get our answers. Where are the others?
Dorian's missing in action. And Mr. Skinner must have fled when he realized we knew.
Sawyer?
He'll live to fight another day.
Don't worry, I've had my fill of throats for this evening.
Skinner?
It's okay! It's Skinner!
What the hell are you doing here?
What makes you think I'm Skinner, huh?
Are you okay?
That's the last time I play with matches!
Don't be afraid.
Who says I'm afraid?
YOU DO!
YOU STINK OF FEAR!
Heh. That was naughty.
Thanks.
Eyes open, boy. I can't protect you all the time.
And you are?
Special Agent Sawyer, American Secret Service."
William H. 'Billy the Kid' Bonney,BT,Young Gun,"I never stole a horse from someone I didn't like. Did I like him? Hell no; I loved the son of a bitch. You asked me if I have scars? Yessir, I have my scars.
William H. Bonney, heh? Billy the Kid was shot and killed by Pat Garrett. Everybody knows that, it's common knowledge.
There are other lawyers around, you piece of chicken shit. Get back in the vehicle and drive before I make it 22 just for the goddamn hell of it."
Jake,BT,Young Gun,"All I did was kiss a girl!
They got you in jail for that?
Yeah, I kissed a girl, and this other fella didn't like it, so we had some words, and so I decided to get out of there. So I did, I got out of there. You know me, Emmett, I don't want no trouble. So, I go outside, and this fellow tries to shoot me in the back.
You had to kill him?
No, no, I winged him. And he dropped his gun.
They got you in jail for winging a guy?
Well... no, not exactly. Because, see, then his friend opened up on me.
What friend is that?
The one with the shotgun.
The DEAD one.
Making a big mistake.
That's what I told 'em!
Nothing happened, Tyree. This is my job.
Shut up.
I don't believe a lady has to explain anything to a man this ugly.
What's the trouble here?
Stay out of this, Paden.
He can't do that, Tyree. Cobb's hired him.
That's Cobb's mistake.
Come on out of there, Phoebe, you've done enough.
Go on home, Jake.
All I did was kiss the girl.
That's what you said in Turley. Remember how that ended?
What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
I don't want you getting anybody in my place.
Boom.
I should've killed you a long time ago.
Why not now?
Don't do it, Tyree. I just lost one partner. If you kill him, I'll never get anyone to work in here.
You better start looking.
You really are a gambler, aren't you?
Give me some of the good stuff.
Where you been, Paden?
Oh, I was just, uh... checking the, uh...
Geez, Paden, her old man ain't even cold yet.
I got things to do, kid, I'm a busy man.
I go with you.
A grown man can't have a little boy with him everywhere he goes.
Well, who's a grown man?
You've been to Chicago?
Yeah.
Was it wonderful?
No.
I'll see you 'round.
Last one at the Midnight Star buys.
You're on. Let's get 'em!
Hey, Paden. Good luck.
We'll be back!
Come on, boys! Jake's in town! Let's start the ball!"
Eric Draven,BP,Tranquil Fury,"Can't rain all the time...
Police! Don't move! I said, ""Don't move!""
I thought the police always said, ""Freeze!""
Well, I am the police, and I say, ""Don't move"" Snow White. You move, you're dead.
And I say, ""I'm dead,"" and I move.
Little things used to mean so much to Shelly- I used to think they were kind of trivial. Believe me, nothing is trivial.
Mother is the name for God on the lips and hearts of all children. Do you understand? Morphine is bad for you. Your daughter is out there on the streets waiting for you.
Suddenly I heard a tapping, as of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
What are you talking about?
You heard me rapping, right?
Victims; aren't we all?
Is that gasoline I smell?
Jesus Christ!
Jesus Christ? Stop me if you heard this one: Jesus Christ walks into a hotel.
Ow! He hands the innkeeper three nails, and he asks...
Don't you ever fuckin' die?
Can you put me up for the night?
You're the guy that murdered Tin-Tin.
He was already dead. He died a year ago the moment he touched her. They're all dead. They just don't know it yet.
Take your shot, Funboy. You got me dead bang.
Are you gonna vanish into thin air again?
I thought I'd use your front door.
It's more like surfing than skating. I wish the rain would stop just once.
It can't rain all the time.
Eric?
What are you supposed to be, a clown or something?
Sometimes.
I have something to give you. I don't want it anymore. Thirty hours of pain all at once, all for you.
I thought, you know, you were invincible!
I was. I'm not any more.
Hehe... aw fuck...
A whole jolly club with jolly pirate nicknames!
Look, I'm beggin' you, alright? Don't kill me.
I'm not gonna kill you. Your job will be to tell the rest of them that death is coming for them, tonight. Tell them Eric Draven sends his regards.
I see you have made your decision, now let's see you enforce it.
Aw, this is already boring the shit out of me. Kill 'im!
How the hell did that thing get in here?
Gentlemen!
Do you know someone named T-bird? He had a friend who shouldn't have played with knives.
I love you.
Say that again.
I love you.
You shouldn't smoke these. They'll kill you.
Mr. Gideon, you're not paying attention!
No! My hand!
I repeat: A Gold engagement ring, yes? It was pawned here a year ago by a customer of yours named Tin Tin. He confided in me before he ran out of breath!
You have one chance to live.
Look, man take anything you want.
Thank you.
TAKE ANYTHING!
Warmer?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
Don't you know this game?
Guess it's not a good day to be a bad guy, huh, Skank?
I'm not Skank.
That's Skank right there. Skank's dead.
That's right.
That piece of ratshit made Tin-Tin into a fucking voodoo doll!
Tin-Tin's a dick.
Tin-Tin.
, :
Fire it up! Fire it up! Fire it up! Fire it up!
, :
Fire it up! Fire it up! Fire it up! Fire it up!
Fire it up!
No Funboy.
Probably still banging away on Darla.
Smokes and road beers. Be quick.
I'm on it.
Who the fuck are you supposed to be, man?
I'm your passenger.
Drive.
MURDERER!
I didn't murder nobody man. I don't even fucking know you, man. What the fuck you want, man?
I want you to tell me a story: A man and a woman in a loft a year ago.
You're outta your fucking mind.
LISTEN! I'm sure you'll remember. You killed them, on Halloween.
Yeah, yeah, right, I've got- Halloween, yeah. Some dude, some bitch, whatever, ma...
Her name was Shelly. You cut her, you raped her.
Shelly, yeah, yeah. I shagged her pink ass and she LOVED it!"
John Preston,BP,Tranquil Fury,"Let me ask you something.
Why are you alive?
I'm alive... I live... to safeguard the continuity of this great society. To serve Libria.
It's circular. You exist to continue your existence. What's the point?
What's the point of your existence?
To feel. 'Cause you've never done it, you can never know it. But it's as vital as breath. And without it, without love, without anger, without sorrow, breath is just a clock... ticking.
I'll do what I can to see they go easy on you.
We both know they never ""go easy"".
Then, I'm sorry.
No, you're not. You don't even know the meaning. Its just a vestigial word for a feeling you've never felt.
Wait! Wait! Look at me. Look at me. I'm life. I live... I, I breathe... I feel. Now that you know it... can you really take it? Is it really worth the price?
I pay it gladly.
There's no war. No murder.
What is it you think we do?
No. You've been with me, you've seen how it can be - the jealousy, rage.
A heavy cost. I pay it gladly.
And you, Preston, the supposed savior of the resistance, are now its destroyer, and, along with them, you've given me yourself... calmly... coolly... entirely without incident.
No.
Oh... Shit.
Not without incident.
Looking for something. If I were you I'd be more careful in future.
How long?
Since mom
And Lisa
Of course
How did you know?
You forget. It's my job to know what you're thinking.
And you know what I'm gonna do now.
Always practicing, Cleric. Maybe that's why you're the best.
Maybe I'm just better.
When we return from the Nether it always reminds me of why we do what we do.
It does?
I beg your pardon?
It does.
Will you do it?
Yes.
Can you?
I don't know.
John?
Yes?
I saw Robbie Taylor crying today. He didn't know, but I saw. Do you think I should report him?
Unquestionably.
Go. Go, damn you!
Get out of here, God damn it! If you don't, you're dead!
Don't do it. He'll shoot us in the back.
If I was gonna shoot you, I'd shoot you in the face. Now go.
You're an offender!
I'm not!
No? Then why are you so scared of me?
You can't do this! You cannot do this!
Tetragrammaton. There's nothing we can't do.
It is not the will of the Council, it is the will of Father and he is law.
Sir... without the logic of process, is it not just mayhem - what we have worked so hard to eradicate?
You must understand, Preston, that while you - and even I - may not always agree with it,it is not the message that is important, it is our obedience to it. Father's will. Call it faith. You have it, I assume?
Yes. I have it.
Good.
What... what'll you do?
...I don't know.
Then I have no choice but to remand you to the Palace of Justice for processing.
Processing. You mean execution, don't you?
Processing.
I'm coming.
You're absolutely 100% right, sir.
Of course I am.
Interesting...
Watch out!"
Ethan Hunt,BP,Tranquil Fury,"So, how does it feel to be a solid citizen again?
Man, I don't know. I'm gonna miss bein' disreputable.
Well, Luther, if it makes you feel any better, I'll always think of you that way.
Can I ask you something, Kittridge? If you're dealing with a man who has crushed, shot, stabbed, and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're gonna make him by hauling Mom and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
The only person allowed inside has to pass through a series of security checks. First is voiceprint identification
William Donloe.
Then, he has to put in a 6 digit code.
That only gets him into the outer room. Next, he is positively identified by retinal scan.
Finally, the security measures are only deactivated after insertion of a double electronic keycard... which we won't have.
Once inside the vault, there are 3 security systems in operation whenever the technician is out of the room. First is sound sensitive; anything above a whisper will set it off. The second is temperature-sensitive. Even the body heat of an unauthorized person inside the vault can trigger the alarm if the temperature rises just a single degree. And that temperature is controlled by an air conditioning vent 30 feet above the vault floor. That vent is guarded by a laser net.
The third one is on the floor, and it's pressure sensitive. Just the slightest increase in weight will set it off. And any of these systems, if set off, will trigger an automatic lockdown. Now believe me when I tell you, gentlemen, that all 3 systems, are state of the art.
They're dead.
What? Who's dead?
My team. My team is DEAD. They knew we were coming, man. They knew we were coming and the disk is gone.
Are you intact?
Do you read me! The list is in the OPEN!
Zero bodycount.
We'll see.
Relax Luther, it's much worse than you think.
Any questions?
Yeah. Could we get a capuccino machine in here? 'Cause I don't know what you call this.
I call it cruel and unusual.
Hey, I made that coffee.
Exactly.
RED LIGHT, GREEN LIGHT!
Of course he knew. Just *when* he knew is something of a mystery. You mind telling me, Ethan? Was it before or after I showed up in London?
Before London. But after you took the Bible from the Drake Hotel in Chicago.
They stamped it, didn't they? Those damn Gideons.
You know, Claire was wrong about one thing, Jim.
Oh really? What's that?
Good morning, Mr. Phelps.
I'm not the only one who's seen you alive.
Tell me, Senator, do you all have someone on your staff named Jack?
Jack... I believe we did have a Jack. An unreliable fellow as I recall. Constantly late, and behind in his work. I was forced to tie him behind one of my best stallions and drag him around my barn for a few days.
Relax your crack, Foghorn. I'm working on it
Reach your folks?
How do they feel?
About what?
The apology from the Justice Department, VIP treatment. You know, the whole nine yards.
Well, my mom was a little confused how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the Florida Keys.
I thought I was going to see Max.
You misunderstood. No one sees Max.
Then what am I doing here?
Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say.
I don't communicate very well through a shroud.
If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you will be wearing that shroud indefinitely.
The disk Job sold you is worthless. Bait. Part of an internal mole hunt.
And how would you know? Are you another company man?
Like Job?
We're asking about you
I'm NOC, Was. Now, disavowed.
Why, may I ask?
That's the question I want to ask Job.
Ahh, we missed you, Jim.
Missed you too, Ethan.
Were you on one of your cushy recruiting assignments again?
Yeah, where did they put you up this time? The Plaza?
Drake Hotel, Chicago.
Punishing. 24 hour room service?
Chauffeured limos? Man's getting soft in his old age.
The list is in the open.
Calm down Ethan, look some and see me.
Wait, you're in Prague?
I - ahm - I can't tell you how, uh sorry I am. I know how much Jim in particular meant to you, Ethan, personally as well as professionally.
Yeah.
It's - uhhh - passport, visa, the usual drill. We'll work the ex-filtration through Canada, debrief you at Langley, throw the Prague police a bone or two, you know. Toss them a few suspects. You follow me?
Yeah. I follow.
I think we lost enough agents for one night.
You mean, *I've* lost enough agents for one night.
You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, Ethan.
Who else is left?
Yeah. I see your point.
Why was there another team?
What?
Of IMF agents at the embassy - tonight...
I don't quite follow you.
Well, let's see if you can follow me around the room. The drunk Russians on the embankment at seven and eight o'clock. The couple waltzing around me at the embassy at nine and eleven. The waiter standing behind Hannah at the top of the stairs, bow tie, twelve o'clock. The other IMF team! You're worried about me, why?
Well, for a little over two years we have been spotting serious blowback in IMF operations, we have a penetration. The other day, we decoded a message on the Internet from a Czech we know as Max.
The Arms dealer.
That's right. Max, it seems has two unique gifts: a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he'd gotten to someone on the inside, he'd gotten himself into a position to buy our NOC list, operation he referred to as job 314. The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.
The list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.
That's correct. The actual list is secure at Langley. Golitsyn was a lightning rod. He was one of ours.
This whole operation was a mole hunt. This whole operation was a mole hunt.
Yeah, the mole's deep inside... and like you said, you survived. I want to show you something, Ethan.
Since your father's death, your family's farm has been in receivership. Now, suddenly, they're flush with over a hundred twenty grand in the bank, your father's illness was supposed to wipe out that bank account. Dying slowly in America after all, can be a very expensive proposition.
So. Why don't we quietly get out of here onto a plane. I can understand you're very upset.
Kittridge, you've never seen me very upset.
Alright, Hunt. Enough is enough. You have bribed, cajoled and killed and you have done it using loyalties on the inside, you want to shake hands with the devil, that's fine with me, I just want to make sure you do it in hell.
Excuse me. Mr. Hunt? Would you like to watch a movie?
Oh, uh, no thank you.
Would you consider the cinema of the Caribbean? Aruba, perhaps?
You really think we can do this.
We're going to do it.
This is the Mount Everest of hacks.
Why Jim? Why?
Well, you think about it Ethan, it was inevitable. No more cold war. No more secrets you keep from yourself. Answer to no one but yourself. Then, you wake up one morning and find out the President is running the country without your permission. The son of a bitch, how dare he. Then you realize, it's over. You are an obsolete peice of hardware, not worth upgrading, you got a lousy marriage, and 62 grand a year.
Krieger, from this point on... absolute silence!
I think we've lost enough agents for one night.
You mean, *I've* lost enough agents for one night.
You seem hell-bent on blaming yourself, Ethan.
Who else is left?
Yeah. I see your point.
Wake up, Claire! Jim's dead! He's dead! They're all dead!
Saved your ass again, Jack.
Give me a break, Pops.
Such a nice ass.
And a lonely ass.
Just give me the money.
You've earned it.
We're being ambushed Ethan. Abort! That's an order.
Negative. Golitsyn is on the move.
No, dammit, I said abort!
Eye on the package. Jim, I'm Coming.
Job 3:14..."
David Sumner,BP,Tranquil Fury,"I don't know my way home.
That's okay. I don't either.
Radiation. That's an unfortunate dispensation.
Surely is. Yes, indeed.
As long as it's not another bomb.
You're a scientist - can you deny the responsibility?
Can you?
After all, there's never been a kingdom given to so much bloodshed as that of Christ.
That's Montesquieu, isn't it?
Oh, really?
Who's he?
Somebody well worth reading.
David, give Niles to them. That's what they want. They just want him. Give them Niles, David!
They'll beat him to death.
I don't care! Get him out!
You really don't care, do you?
No, I don't.
No. I care. This is where I live. This is me. I will not allow violence against this house.
Jesus. I got 'em all!
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, shit!
Why don't you grow up?
I'm trying to!
You act like you're fourteen years old.
I am fourteen years old.
Wanna try for twelve?

How about eight? I freak out for eight year olds.
Ok, you've had your fun. I'll give you one more chance, and if you don't clear out now, there'll be real trouble. I mean it."
Max Cady,BP,Tranquil Fury,"I ain't no white trash piece of shit. I'm better than you all! I can out-learn you. I can out-read you. I can out-think you. And I can out-philosophize you. And I'm gonna outlast you. You think a couple whacks to my guts is gonna get me down? It's gonna take a hell of a lot more than that, Counselor, to prove you're better than me!
""I am like God, and God like me. I am as large as God, He is as small as I. He cannot above me, nor I beneath Him be."" Silesius, 17th Century.
I'm Virgil and I'm guidin' you through the gates of Hell. We are now in the Ninth Circle, the Circle of Traitors. Traitors to country! Traitors to fellow man! Traitors to GOD! You, sir, are charged with betrayin' the principles of all three! Quote for me the American Bar Association's Rules of Professional Conduct, Canon Seven.
""A lawyer should represent his client... ""
""Should ZEALOUSLY represent his client within the bounds of the law."" I find you guilty, counselor! Guilty of betrayin' your fellow man! Guilty of betrayin' your country and abrogatin' your oath! Guilty of judgin' me and sellin' me out! With the power vested in me by the kingdom of God, I sentence you to the Ninth Circle of Hell! Now you will learn about loss! Loss of freedom! Loss of humanity! Now you and I will truly be the same...
Counselor! Come out, come out, wherever you are!
It's not necessary to lay a foul tongue on me my friend. I could get upset. Things could get out of hand. Then in self defense, I could do something to you that you would not like, right here.
Every man... every man has to go through hell to reach paradise.
Are you my friend? Are you my friend?
No I'm not your friend.
Well, see, I like to plan my comings and goings with friends, so if you're planning my comings and goings I'd call that presumptuous, in fact I'd call it downright rude.
I understand, I'm not your type, too many tattoos. Thing is, there isn't much to do in prison except desecrate your flesh.
You learn about loss.
Are you a cop? Or were you a cop? Or were you not good enough to remain on the force? Cause you know what? That's the feeling I'm getting here.
So, here we are, two lawyers for all practical purposes talking shop.
How much do you want Mr. Cady?
How much do I want what?
How much money do you want?
Money? Counselor, do I look destitute you.
Well I'm open to discussion within reasonable limits.
You ever been a woman.
What?
A woman... some fat, hairy hillbilly's wet dream.
Mmm mmm, hot as a fire cracker on the fourth of July.
Stop! Stop!
Yes, Leigh?
Listen to me, Max, listen to me. You know, Max, since all this started, I've thought about you all the time. I've tried to imagine what it must have been like for you, all those years locked up in jail... I've tried to imagine you and even your crimes, and how you must have felt in those moments that you did them... See, I know about loss, Max. I know about losing time, even losing years. And I know it doesn't compare to jail, but I can understand. And I can share this with you. Because of that, whatever it is you've got planned, I want you to do it just with me... not with her... because... we have this connection.

Free as a bird. You go wherever you want with whomever.
I'd like my keys back please.
Could it be you don't remember me?
I remember you. You were at the movies the other night.
I'm disappointed. I'm hurt.
I would like my keys.
Max Cady. You look the same. Maybe 15 pounds heavier. But they say the average man gains a pound a year till he's about... Come on. Gains a pound a year till he's about 60. Me? I dropped a pound every year in my sentence.
Atlanta. July 1977?
You got it.
Fourteen years since I held a set of keys.
You ready to be born again, Miss Bowden?
Maybe I could chop you into 40 pieces.
Counselor... could you be there? Could you be there?
Your mommy's not happy... your daddy's not happy, and you know what? You're not happy.
I am going to teach you the meaning of commitment. Fourteen years ago I was forced to make a commitment to an eight by nine cell, now you are going to be forced to make a commitment. You could say I'm here to save you.
Danielle were you about to offer me something hot?
Let's get something straight... I spent fourteen years in an eight by nine foot cell surrounded by people who were less than human, my mission in that time was to become more than human
... so you see! Granddaddy used to handle snakes in church, Granny drank strychnine. I guess you could say I had a leg up, genetically speaking.
Counselor.
What about your books?
Already read 'em.
... well, you can trust in me 'cause I'm the ""Do-Right Man"".
I learned that in prison... You white-trash piece of shit!
Forget about that restraining order, Counselor? You're well within 500 yards!
You will now have an opportunity. ""What is that opportunity?"", you ask. Why, here and now, we have an opportunity to depict and dramatize...
Oh, no!
...both the heights and the depths of a mama's true love of her daughter, if y'all get my meaning. C'mon out, baby, let's go. C'mon darling. Get out.
Get up here.
Because I knew he brutally beat and rapped her
Talk... TO ME! I'm Right HERE
Just because she was promiscuous... Didn't give YOU THE RIGHT TO RAPE HER! But YOU BRAGGED you beat TWO prior rapes... you were a menace!
YOU WERE MY LAYWER... You Were My Lawyerthat report could've saved me FOURTEEN YEARS
Your Probably Right
YOU SELF-RIGHTEOUS FUCK!
I'm bound for the promise land I am I'm bound for the promised land
Hey, Cady! Come here. Wait up a second. You know, I've been in a real bad mood lately. Shame, innit? You know what you can do to brighten my mood?
No.
Get the hell out of here.
I don't just mean this whole town. I mean the whole goddam state. I don't want to see you. I don't want to hear you. And I don't want to smell you... now leave.
Now, I like... are you my friend?
No, I'm not your friend.
Oh, cause' I thought maybe you were my friend, cause' I like to plan my comings and goings with friends. But if you're not my friend you're plannin' my comings and goings. I'd call that presumptuous. In fact, I'd call it downright rude, cause' I ain't your porch-baby, buddy.
Well, gee-golly-gosh. I sure am sorry I offended you you white-trash piece of shit.
Ooh, I got the all-over fidgets on that one! And you're really shaken' me up! I'm shiveren' all over! Whew! Its not necessary to lay a foul tongue on me, my friend. I could get upset. Things could get out of hand. And then in self-defence, I could do something to you that you would not like... right here.
Anytime you feel squirrely you just jump.
You threatenin' me? You threatenin' me?
You catch on fast.
Cause' I'm well within my rights to be here and you know it. And if I stay here what you gonna' do?
I don't give a rat's ass about your rights. You just watch your step. And you know what I'm talkin' about.
What you gonna' do? Arrest me? What are you a cop? Or where you a cop? Or where you not good enough to remain on the force? Cause' you know what? That's the feelin' I'm gettin' here.
Hope you enjoyed your breakfast.
You already sacrificed me counsellor
This is my night, Counselor. Don't you step on my lines!"
Driver,BP,Tranquil Fury,"There's a hundred-thousand streets in this city. You don't need to know the route. You give me a time and a place, I give you a five minute window. Anything happens in that five minutes and I'm yours. No matter what. Anything happens a minute either side of that and you're on your own. Do you understand?
Good. And you won't be able to reach me on this phone again.
Can I talk to you? I won't keep you long. I have to go somewhere and I don't think I can come back. But I just wanted you to know. Getting to be around you and Benicio was the best thing that ever happened to me.
Is he a bad guy?
Yeah.
How can you tell?
Because he's a shark.
There's no good sharks?
You're Shannon's buddy right? We met last year. You drove me and my brother back from Palm Springs. We hired another wheelman. I spent six months in jail. My brother, he got himself killed. I got this sweet job coming up.
How 'bout this. You shut your mouth. Or I'll kick your teeth down your throat and I'll shut it for you.
Nice seein' you again.
If I drive for you, you get your money. You tell me where we start, where we're going, where we're going afterwards. I give you five minutes when we get there. Anything happens in that five minutes and I'm yours. No matter what. Anything a minute on either side of that and you're on your own. I don't sit in while you're running it down. I don't carry a gun. I drive.
You look like you're hard to work with.
Kid, I want you to meet Mr. Bernie Rose!
Nice to meet you.
My hands are a little dirty.
So are mine.
You know the story about the scorpion and the frog? Your friend Nino didn't make it across the river.
Hey, you want a toothpick?
Now, you just got a little boy's father killed. And you almost got us killed. And now you're lying to me. So how about this? From now on, every word out of your mouth is the truth. Or I'm going to hurt you.
I don't have wheels on my car.
Okay.
It's one thing you should know about me.
Sorry about the noise.
I was going to call the cops.
I wish you would.
Hey, do you want to see something?
What do you do?
I drive.
Like a limo driver?
No, like, for movies.
Oh. You mean all the car chases and stuff?
Yeah.
Isn't that dangerous?
It's only part-time. Mostly I work at a garage.
What is it you got there? Can I see?
One of those men gave you that?
They told me not to lose it.
You want me to keep that for you?
I'll see you in five minutes.
I'll see you in four.
What do you get out of it?
Just that. Out of it.
You two know each other?
Don't.
Oh, look at that!
We're neighbors.
Neighbors? Very good. Well, we'll try to be neighborly too.
Do you understand?
You blinked.
What?
Where's the money now?
It's in the car.
Come on.
Did Shannon ever tell you how we met?
No.
I used to produce movies. In the 80s. Kind of like action films. Sexy stuff. One critic called them European. I thought they were shit. Anyway, he arranged all the cars for me. Did all the stunts. I liked him. I liked having him around. Even though he overcharged the shit out of me. His next business venture, he got involved with some of Nino's friends. They didn't go for the overcharging bit. They broke his pelvis. He's never had a lot of luck. The reason I'm telling you this is that he has a lot invested in you. And so do I. So anything you need, you call me. We're a team now.
I'm excited!
Nino, let's get the fuck out of here!
You get out of here and you never fucking come back. You never come back.
What are you going to do?
That's Benicio's father
Where is he?
He's in prison.
Oh."
Han Solo,"AV, N, BQ","Loveable Rogue, Charmer, Trickster","Uh, everything's under control. Situation normal.
What happened?
Uh, we had a slight weapons malfunction, but uh... everything's perfectly all right now. We're fine. We're all fine here now, thank you. How are you?
We're sending a squad up.
Uh, uh... negative, negative. We had a reactor leak here now. Give us a few minutes to lock it down. Large leak, very dangerous.
Who is this? What's your operating number?
Uh...
Boring conversation anyway. LUKE, WE'RE GONNA HAVE COMPANY!
Wonderful girl. Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.
She's rich.
Rich?
Rich, powerful. Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be...
What?
Well, more wealth than you can imagine!
I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit.
Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.
Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight. I take orders from just one person: me.
It's a wonder you're still alive.
Will someone get this big walking carpet out of my way?
No reward is worth this.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrgh!
He made a fair move. Screaming about it can't help you.
Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.
But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.
That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their sockets when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that.
Grrf.
I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, R2: let the Wookiee win.
It's not over yet.
It is for me, sister. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.
You needn't worry about your reward. If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive.
Your friend is quite the mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything. Or anybody.
I care.
So, what do you think of her, Han?
I'm tryin' not to, kid.
Good.
Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, whaddya think? You think a princess and a guy like me...
No.
Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells me you're lookin' for passage to the Alderaan system?
Yes indeed, if it's a fast ship.
Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?
Should I have?
It's the ship that made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs. I've outrun Imperial starships. Not the local bulk cruisers mind you, I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now. She's fast enough for you old man. What's the cargo?
Only passengers. Myself, the boy, two droids... and no questions asked.
What is it? Some kind of local trouble?
Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.
You don't believe in the Force, do you?
Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other, and I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen *anything* to make me believe that there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. 'Cause no mystical energy field controls *my* destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.
Get in there, you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell!
They're gonna execute her! Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured. Now all you want to do is stay?
Marching into a detention area is not what I had in mind.
But they're gonna kill her!
Better her than me!
This is some rescue! You came in here, but didn't you have a plan for getting out?
He's the brains, sweetheart!
Great shot, kid, that was one in a million!
I don't what we're gonna do now. Even if I could take off, I could never get past the tractor beam.
Leave that to me.
Damn fool, I knew you were going to say that.
Who's the more foolish? The fool, or the fool who follows him?
I have you now!
What?
YAHOOO!
Look out!
You're all clear, kid, now let's *blow* this thing and go home!
One thing's for sure, we're all gonna be a lot thinner.
Got him! I got him!
Great, kid! Don't get cocky.
Going somewhere, Solo?
Yes, Greedo. I was just going to see your boss. Tell Jabba I've got his money.
It's too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jabba's put a price on your head so large, every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you. I'm lucky I found you first.
Yeah, but this time I've got the money.
If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.
I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba...
Jabba's through with you! He has no use for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.
Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice?
You can tell that to Jabba. At best, he may only take your ship.
Over my dead body!
That's the idea... I've been looking forward to this for a long time.
Yeah, I'll bet you have.
Sorry about the mess.
So. You got your reward and you're just leaving, then?
That's right, yeah. Got some old debts I gotta pay off with this stuff. Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you? Why don't you come with us? You're pretty good in a fight. We could use you.
Come on. Why don't you take a look around. You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you, you're turning your back on them.
What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station is not my idea of courage. It's more like, suicide.
Okay. Take care of yourself Han. I guess that's what you're best at isn't it?
Hey, Luke. May the Force be with you.
What're you looking at? I know what I'm doing.
Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em.
Don't everyone thank me at once.
This is *not* gonna work.
Why didn't you say so before?
I *did* say so before.
You came in that thing? You're braver than I thought.
Nice! Come on.
Garbage chute. Really wonderful idea. What an incredible smell you've discovered! Let's get out of here! Get away from there...
No, wait...!
Will you forget it? I already tried it. It's magnetically sealed!
Put that thing away, you're gonna get us all killed!
Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here! Now it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us.
It could be worse.
It's worse.
Good against remotes is one thing. Good against the living, that's something else.
Stay sharp. There's two more coming in. They're gonna try and cut us off.
Why don't you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was fast!
Watch your mouth, kid, or you're gonna find yourself floating home! We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose 'em.
Here's where the fun begins.
How long before you can make the jump to light speed?
It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.
Are you kidding? At the rate they're gaining...?
Traveling through hyperspace ain't like dusting crops, boy! Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star, or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it.
... What's that flashing?
We're losing a deflector shield. Go strap yourselves in. I'm going to make the jump to light speed.

Going somewhere, Solo?
Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss.
Tell Jabba that I've got his money.
Its too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jabba put a price on your head so large, every bounty hunter will be looking for you. I'm lucky I found you first.
Yeah, but this time, I've got the money.
If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.
I don't have it WITH me.
Tell Jabba...
Jabba's through with you. He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an imperial cruiser.
Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I have a choice.
You can tell that to Jabba. He may only take your ship.
Over my dead body.
That's the idea. I've been looking forward to this for a long time.
Yes, I bet you have.
Sorry about the mess.
There's something alive in here.
That's your imagination.
Something just moved passed my leg.
Look! Did you see that?
What?
What a piece of junk!
She'll make point five past lightspeed. She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've made a lot of special modifications myself.
Boy, it's lucky you have these compartments.
I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them. This is ridiculous.
Come on. Why don't you take a look around? You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them.
What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like... suicide.
All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?
Hey, Luke... may the Force be with you.
What're you lookin' at? I know what I'm doin'.
You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.
Bring 'em on, I'd prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
Master Luke, sir. Pardon me for asking, but what should R2 and I do if we're discovered here?
Lock the door.
And hope they don't have blasters.
That isn't very reassuring.
They let us go. It was the only reason for the ease of our escape.
Easy? You call that easy?
They're tracking us.
Not this ship, sister.
At least the information in R2 is still intact.
What's so important? What's he carrying?
The technical readouts of that battle station. I only hope that when the data's analyzed a weakness can be found. It's not over yet.
Sure hope the old man got that tractor beam out of commission, or this is gonna be a real short trip. Okay, hit it!
Jabba, you're a wonderful human being.
Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You know, sometimes I amaze even myself.
That doesn't sound too hard.
Where are you taking this... thing?
Prisoner transfer. Cell block 1138?
I wasn't notified. I'll have to clear it.
Look out he's loose!
He'll tear us all apart!
I'll get him!
Where did you dig up that old fossil?
Ben is a great man.
Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.
Looks like you've managed to cut off our only escape route.
Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, your highness.
What the hell are you doing?
Well somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage, fly-boy!
Can't get out that way.
Looks like you've managed to cut off our only escape route.
Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, your Highness.
What kept you?
We, uh, ran into some old friends.
Solo! Come out of there, Solo! Solo!
Right here, Jabba.
I've been waiting for you.
Have you now.
You didn't think I was gonna run, did you?
Han, my boy, you disappoint me. Why haven't you paid me? And why did you fry poor Greedo?
Look, Jabba, next time you wanna talk to me, come see me yourself. Don't send one of these twerps.
Han, I can't make exceptions. What if everyone who smuggled for me dropped their cargo at the first sign of an Imperial starship? It's not good for business.
Look, Jabba, even I get boarded sometimes.
Did you think I had a choice? But I got a nice easy charter now; I'll pay you back, plus a little extra. I just need a little more time.
Han, my boy, you're the best smuggler I ever hired. So, for an extra twenty percent...
Fifteen, Jabba, and don't push it.
Okay, fifteen percent. But if you fail me again, I'll put a price on your head so big, you won't be able to go near a civilized system.
Jabba, you're a wonderful human being.
Come on.
What the-? We've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower, some kind of asteroid collision. It's not on any of the charts!
What's going on?
Our position's correct, except... no Alderaan.
What do you mean? Where is it?
That's what I'm trying to tell you, kid, it ain't there, it's been totally blown away.
*What*? How?
Destroyed by the Empire.
The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet. It'd take a thousand ships, with more firepower than I've...
Uh, everything's under control. Situation normal.
What happened?
Uh, we had a slight weapons malfunction, but uh... everything's perfectly all right now. We're fine. We're all fine here now, thank you. How are you?
We're sending a squad up.

Looks like you've managed to cut off our only escape route.
Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, your highness.
What the hell are you doing?
Well somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage, fly-boy!
Can't get out that way.
Looks like you've managed to cut off our only escape route.
Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, your Highness.
What kept you?
We, uh, ran into some old friends.
Solo! Come out of there, Solo! Solo!
Right here, Jabba.
I've been waiting for you.
Have you now.
You didn't think I was gonna run, did you?
Han, my boy, you disappoint me. Why haven't you paid me? And why did you fry poor Greedo?
Look, Jabba, next time you wanna talk to me, come see me yourself. Don't send one of these twerps.
Han, I can't make exceptions. What if everyone who smuggled for me dropped their cargo at the first sign of an Imperial starship? It's not good for business.
Look, Jabba, even I get boarded sometimes.
Did you think I had a choice? But I got a nice easy charter now; I'll pay you back, plus a little extra. I just need a little more time.
Han, my boy, you're the best smuggler I ever hired. So, for an extra twenty percent...
Fifteen, Jabba, and don't push it.
Okay, fifteen percent. But if you fail me again, I'll put a price on your head so big, you won't be able to go near a civilized system.
Jabba, you're a wonderful human being.
Come on.
What the-? We've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower, some kind of asteroid collision. It's not on any of the charts!
What's going on?
Our position's correct, except... no Alderaan.
What do you mean? Where is it?
That's what I'm trying to tell you, kid, it ain't there, it's been totally blown away.
*What*? How?
Destroyed by the Empire.
The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet. It'd take a thousand ships, with more firepower than I've...
No! Stop, Chewie, stop! Chewie! Chewie this won't help me! Hey! Save your strength. There'll be another time. The Princess. You have to take care of her. You hear me? Huh?
I love you.
I know.
Why, you stuck up... half-witted... scruffy-looking... Nerf-herder!
Who's scruffy-looking?
Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately 3,720 to 1.
Never tell me the odds.
Your Tauntaun will freeze before you reach the first marker!
Then I'll see you in Hell!
Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help.
Would you please stop calling me that?
Sure, Leia.
You make it so difficult sometimes.
I do, I really do. You could be a little nicer, though. Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right.
Occasionally, maybe... when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that.
Stop that.
Stop what?
Stop that. My hands are dirty.
My hands are dirty, too. What are you afraid of?
Afraid?
You're trembling.
I'm not trembling.
You like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren't enough scoundrels in your life.
I happen to like nice men.
I'm nice men.
No, you're not. You're...
Let go.
Shh.
Let go, please.
Don't get excited.
Captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited.
Sorry sweetheart. I haven't got time for anything else.
Well Princess, it looks like you managed to keep me here a while longer.
I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for anyone to leave the system until they've activated the energy shield.
That's a good story. I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.
I don't know where you get your delusions, laser brain.
Laugh it up, fuzzball.
Sir. Sir, I've isolated the reverse, power flux coupling.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Oh you're perfectly welcome, sir.
You're not actually going IN to an asteroid field?
They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?
This may smell bad, kid, but it'll keep you warm until I get the shelter up... Ugh. And I thought they smelled bad on the *outside*.
You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake, well, this could be it, sweetheart.
I take it back.
Afraid I was gonna leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?
I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.
I can arrange that. You could use a good kiss.
Would it help if I got out and pushed?
It might!
They're getting closer.
Oh, yeah? Watch this.
Watch what?
I think we're in trouble.
If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to lightspeed!
We're in trouble!
The cave is collapsing.
This is no cave.
Echo Three to Echo Seven. Han, old buddy, do you read me?
Loud and clear, kid. What's up?
Well, I finished my circle. I don't pick up any life readings.
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. Sensors are placed. I'm going back.
Right. I'll see you shortly. There's a meteorite that hit the ground near here. I want to check it out. It won't take long.
Either shut him up or shut him down!
Han, we need you.
We need?
Yes.
Well, what about YOU need?
I need? I don't know what you are talking about.
You probably don't.
And what precisely am I supposed to know?
Come on you want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
Yes, you're great help to us you're a natural leader.
No! That's not it. Come on.
A-ha! Come on!
You're imagining things.
Am I? Then why are you following me afraid I was gonna leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?
I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.
I could arrange that!
You could use a good kiss!
I hope you know what you're doing.
Yeah, me too.
Excuse me sir, but might I inquire as to what's going on?
Why not?
Impossible man.
I had no choice. They arrived right before you did. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too.
We're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
I'm not going to argue with that.
Pulverized?
How ya feeling kid? You don't look so bad to me. You look strong enough to pull the ears off a gundark.
Thanks to you.
That's two you owe me junior.
No time to discuss this as a committee.
I am not a committee!
Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable.
Not entirely stable. I'm glad you're here to tell us these things. Chewie! Take the Professor in back and plug him into the hyperdrive!
Hurry up, goldenrod! Or you're gonna be a permanent resident!
What's going on... Buddy?
You're being put into carbon-freeze.
Sir, If I may venture an opinion...
I'm not really interested in your opinion 3PO.
I feel terrible.
I thought you knew this person.

Well, that was a long time ago, I'm sure he's forgotten about that.
What are you doing here?
Ah, repairs. I was hoping you could help me out.
What have you done to my ship?
YOUR ship? Hey, remember you lost her to me, fair and square.
Deck officer! Deck officer!
I love you.
I know.
It's not my fault.
Having trouble with your droid?
No, no problem. Why?
Horizontal boosters. Alluvial dampers? Ow! That's not it, bring me the Hydrospanner. I don't know how we're going to get out of this one.
OW! Chewie!
OOOOW!
Sorry, am I interrupting anything?
Not really.
You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us among the clouds.
Thank you.
Would you join us for a little refreshment? Everyone's invited, of course.
Having trouble with your droid?
No, no problem. Why?
Would it help if I got out and pushed?
It might!
Get out of here, Lando.
Shut up and listen. Vader has agreed that turn Leia and Chewie over to me.
Over to you?
They'll have to stay here at least, they'll be safe.
What about Han?
Vader's giving him to the bounty hunter.
Vader wants us all dead.
He doesn't want you at all. At least, after somebody call... Skywalker.
Luke?
Lord Vader has set a trap for him.
And we're the bait.
Yeah? Well, he's on his way.
Perfect. You fixed us all real good, didn't you? My friend?
Stop! I've done all I care. I'm sorry I couldn't do better, but I got my own problems.
Yeah... You're a real hero."
Captain Jack Sparrow,"AV, K, N, S, BQ","Loveable Rogue, Byronic Hero, Charmer, Coward, Trickster","There will come a time when you have a chance to do the right thing.
I love those moments. I like to wave at them as they pass by.
Oi! Fishface! Lose something? Eh? Scungilli!
Got it! Come to negotiate, eh? Have you, you slimy git? Look what I got.
I got a jar of dirt, I got a jar of dirt, and guess what's inside it!
Come to join my crew, lad? Welcome aboard!
I'm here to find the man I love.
I'm deeply flattered, son, but my first and only love is the sea.
Meaning William Turner, Captain Sparrow.
Elizabeth!
Hide the rum.
Why is the rum always gone?
Oh... that's why.
Land is where you are safe, Jack Sparrow, and so you will carry land with you.
Dirt. This is a jar of dirt.
Yes.
...Is the jar of dirt going to help?
If you don't want it, give it back.
No!
Then it helps.
*Alas*, my children! This is the day you shall always remember as the day that you almost...
...Captain Jack Sparrow.
My tremendous intuitive sense of the female creature informs me that you are troubled.
You want me to find this?
No. You want you to find this, because the finding of this finds you incapacitorially finding and or locating in your discovering the detecting of a way to save your dolly belle, ol' what's-her-face. Savvy?
This is going to save Elizabeth?
How much do you know about Davy Jones?
Not much.
Yeah, it's going to save Elizabeth.
How did you get here?
Sea turtles, mate. A pair of them strapped to my feet.
Not so easy, is it?
You look bloody awful, what are you doing here?
You hired me. I can't help it if your standards are lax.
You smell funny.
So, we're setting out to find whatever this key unlocks?
No. If we don't have the key, we can't open whatever we don't have that it unlocks. So what purpose would be served in finding whatever need be unlocked, which we don't have, without first having found the key what unlocks it?
So, we're setting out to find this key?
Now you're not making any sense at all.
Is this a dream?
No.
I thought not. If it were, there'd be rum.

Let's put some distance between us and this island and head out to open sea!
Yes to the first, yes to the second, but only insofar as we keep to the shallows as much as possible.
That seems a bit contradictory, Captain.
I have every faith in your reconciliatory navigational skills, Mr. Gibbs, now where is that monkey, I want to shoot something!
So what's your plan, then?
I row over, search the ship until I find your bloody key.
And if there are crewmen?
I cut down anyone in my path.
I like it. Simple, easy to remember.
Do excuse me while I kill the man who ruined my life.
Be my guest.
Let us examine that claim for a moment, former Commodore, shall we? Who was it that, at the very moment you had a notorious pirate safely behind bars, saw fit to free said pirate and take your dearly beloved all to hisself, eh? So whose fault is it *really* that you've ended up a rum-pot deckhand what takes orders from pirates?
ENOUGH!
Unfortunately Mr. Turner, he's right!
Guard the boat, mind the tide... don't touch my dirt.
I wonder, Sparrow, can you live with this? Can you condemn an innocent man, a friend, to a lifetime of servitude in your name while you roam free?
Yep. I'm good with it.
Darling, I am truly unhappy to have to tell you this, but through an unfortunate and entirely unforeseeable series of circumstances that had nothing whatsoever to do with me, poor Will has been press-ganged into Davy Jones's crew.
You have a debt to pay. You've been captain of the Black Pearl for thirteen years. That was our agreement.
Technically, I was only captain for two years, then I was viciously mutinied upon.
Then you were a poor captain, but a captain nonetheless! Have you not introduced yourself all these years as ""Captain Jack Sparrow""?
Where's the Commodore?
He fell behind.
My prayers be with him.
Best not wallow in our grief!
We're not getting out of this.
Not with the chest. Into the boat.
You're mad.
Don't wait for me.
Uh, I say we respect his final wish.
The Black Spot!
The Black Spot!
Black Spot!
My eyesight's as good as ever, just so you know.
Thank you, Jack.
We're not free yet, love.
You came back. I always knew you were a good man.
It's after you, not the ship. It's not us. This is the only way, don't you see?
I'm not sorry.
Pirate.
It's real!
You actually were telling the truth.
I do that quite a lot. Yet people are always surprised.
With good reason.
You know I demand payment.
I brought payment. Look.
An undead monkey! Top that!

No...
You've no idea how long it took us to catch that.
The payment is fair...
Not quite according to plan...
Complications arose, ensued, were overcome.
Oh bugger.
So am I worthy to serve under Captain Jack Sparrow...
... or should I just kill you now?
You're hired!
Sorry. Old habits and all that.
Mr. Gibbs.
Captain.
We have a need to travel upriver.
By ""need,"" do you mean a trifling need? Fleeting? As in, say, a passing fancy?
No, a resolute and unyielding need.
We are very much alike, you and I, I and you... us.
Oh. Except for a sense of honor and decency and a moral center. And personal hygiene.
Trifles.
Jack, the letters, give them back.
No. Persuade me.
You do know Will taught me how to handle a sword.
As I said, persuade me.
Jack's hat!
Clear about!
No, no! Leave it!
Run!
Back to yer stations, the lot o' ye!
Jack?
Shhh.
For the love of Mother and Child, Jack, what's coming after us?
Nothing.
Not so bad...
Oh!
'Ello, beastie.
No, no! More wood! Big fire! I am chief! Want big fire!
You mistrust me? Listen, you can mistrust him, trust me.
You know that don't do no good.
It does me.
You have a touch of destiny about you, William Turner.
You know me?
You want to know me.
There'll be no knowing here! We've come for help and were not leaving without it.
I thought I knew you...
No worries! Tia Dalma and I go way back... thick as thieves, nigh inseparable we are... were... have been... before...
I'll watch yer back.
It's me front I'm worried about.
Mind the boat.
Mind the boat.
Mind the boat.
Mind the boat.
Mind the boat.
Mind the boat.
How are we going?
Including those four? That gives us... four.
Er, Mr. Gibbs...
Aye.
I feel sullied and unusual.
My compass is unique.
*Unique* here having the meaning of *broken*?
True enough.
You know, these clothes do not flatter you at all. It should be a dress or nothing. I happen to have no dress in my cabin.
Ah! A heading. Set sail in a... uh... a general... that way! direction.
I want my jar of dirt!
It's funny what a man will do to forestall his final judgment.
You made a deal with him too, Jack. He raised the Pearl from the depths for you. Thirteen years you've been her captain.
Technically...
You won't be able to talk yourself out of this. The terms that apply to me apply to you as well. One soul, bound to crew a hundred years upon his ship.
Yes, but the Flying Dutchmen already has a captain, so there's really...
Then it's the locker for you! Jones' terrible leviathan will find you, and drag the Pearl back to the depths and you along with it.
Any idea when Jones might release said terrible beastie?
I've already told you, Jack. Your time is up. He comes now.
She's only a ship, mate.
To what do I owe the pleasure of your carbuncle?
He sent me. Davy Jones.
You know of Davy Jones? A man of the sea, a great sailor. Until he run afoul of that which vexes all men.
What vexes all men?
What indeed.
The sea?
Sums?
The dichotomy of good and evil?
A woman.
A woman. He fell in love.
No, no, I heard it was the sea he fell in love with.
Same story, different versions. And all are true. See, it was a woman as changing and harsh and untamable as the sea. Him never stopped loving her. But the pain it caused was to much to live with, but not enough to cause him to die.
What exactly did he put into the chest?
Him heart.
Literally or figuratively?
He couldn't literally put his heart in a chest. Could he?
It was not worth feeling what small, fleeting joy life brings.
Gentlemen, what do keys do?
Keys... unlock... *things*?
Walk the plank!
What did the bird say?
Jack, Elizabeth is in danger!
Have you considered keeping more watchful eye on her? Maybe just lock her up somewhere.
'Ello beastie.
You know, Lizzie, I happen to be captain of a ship. And, as captain, I could perform... a mar-i-age. Right here, on this deck, right now.
Can't let you do that, William. 'Cause if Jones is dead, who's to call his terrible beastie off the hunt, eh? Now, if you please. The key.
I keep the promises I make, Jack. I intend to free my father. I hope you're here to see it.
I can't let you do that, either. So sorry.
I knew you'd warm up to me eventually.
Lord Beckett desires the contents of that chest. I deliver it, I get my life back.
Ah. The dark side of ambition.
Oh, I prefer to see it as the promise of redemption.
Have you not met Will Turner? He's noble, heroic - terrific soprano. Worth at least four... maybe three and a half. And did I happen to mention... he's in love? With a girl. Due to be married. Betrothed. Dividing him from her and her from him would only be half as cruel as actually allowing them to be joined in holy matrimony, eh?
One word love: curiosity. You long for freedom. You long to do what you want to do because you want it. To act on selfish impulse. You want to see what it's like. One day you won't be able to resist.
Jones's terrible leviathan will find you, and drag the Pearl back to the depths and you along with it!
Any idea when Jones might release said terrible beastie?
I already told you, Jack. Your time is up.
It comes now, drawn with ravenous hunger to the man what bears the Black Spot.
The compass you bartered from me it cannot lead you to this?
Maybe. Why?
Ah, Jack Sparrow does not know what he wants.
Why doesn't your compass work?
...My compass works fine.
Savvy?
It's a key!
No! Much more better. It is a *drawing* of a key.
Still rooting for you, mate!
Lum se se, eunuch-y. Snip snip.
That's the Flying Dutchman? It doesn't look like much.
Neither do you. Do not underestimate.
Where is it? Where is the thump-thump?
You already have my payment. One soul to serve on your ship is already over there.
One soul is not equal to another.
Ah-ha! So, we've established my proposal as sound in principle. Now, we're just haggling over price.
As you were, gents.
This... is going to save Elizabeth?
How much do you know about Davey Jones?
Not much.
Yeah, it's gonna save Elizabeth.
Leave 'im lie... unless you're planning to use him to hit somethin' with.
Gentlemen... what do keys do?
Keys unlock... things?
And whatever this key unlocks, inside there's something valuable. So we're setting out to find whatever this key unlocks!
No. If we don't have the key, we can't open whatever it is we don't have that it unlocks. So what purpose would be served in finding whatever need be unlocked, which we don't have, without first having found the key what unlocks it?
So we're going after this key!
You're not making any sense at all.
Do we have a heading?
Ah! A heading! Set sail in a general...
*That* way direction.
If we can outrun her, we can take her. We should turn and fight.
Why fight when you can negotiate?
There will come a time when you have a chance to do the right thing.
I love those moments. I like to wave at them as they pass by.
Oi! Fishface! Lose something? Eh? Scungilli!
Got it! Come to negotiate, eh? Have you, you slimy git? Look what I got.
I got a jar of dirt, I got a jar of dirt, and guess what's inside it!
Come to join my crew, lad? Welcome aboard!
I'm here to find the man I love.

It was not worth feeling what small, fleeting joy life brings.
Gentlemen, what do keys do?
Keys... unlock... *things*?
Walk the plank!
What did the bird say?
Jack, Elizabeth is in danger!
Have you considered keeping more watchful eye on her? Maybe just lock her up somewhere.
'Ello beastie.
You know, Lizzie, I happen to be captain of a ship. And, as captain, I could perform... a mar-i-age. Right here, on this deck, right now.
Can't let you do that, William. 'Cause if Jones is dead, who's to call his terrible beastie off the hunt, eh? Now, if you please. The key.
I keep the promises I make, Jack. I intend to free my father. I hope you're here to see it.
I can't let you do that, either. So sorry.
I knew you'd warm up to me eventually.
Lord Beckett desires the contents of that chest. I deliver it, I get my life back.
Ah. The dark side of ambition.
Oh, I prefer to see it as the promise of redemption.
Have you not met Will Turner? He's noble, heroic - terrific soprano. Worth at least four... maybe three and a half. And did I happen to mention... he's in love? With a girl. Due to be married. Betrothed. Dividing him from her and her from him would only be half as cruel as actually allowing them to be joined in holy matrimony, eh?
One word love: curiosity. You long for freedom. You long to do what you want to do because you want it. To act on selfish impulse. You want to see what it's like. One day you won't be able to resist.
Jones's terrible leviathan will find you, and drag the Pearl back to the depths and you along with it!
Any idea when Jones might release said terrible beastie?
I already told you, Jack. Your time is up.
It comes now, drawn with ravenous hunger to the man what bears the Black Spot.
The compass you bartered from me it cannot lead you to this?
Maybe. Why?
Ah, Jack Sparrow does not know what he wants.
Why doesn't your compass work?
...My compass works fine.
Savvy?
It's a key!
No! Much more better. It is a *drawing* of a key.
Still rooting for you, mate!
Lum se se, eunuch-y. Snip snip.
That's the Flying Dutchman? It doesn't look like much.
Neither do you. Do not underestimate.
Where is it? Where is the thump-thump?
You already have my payment. One soul to serve on your ship is already over there.
One soul is not equal to another.
Ah-ha! So, we've established my proposal as sound in principle. Now, we're just haggling over price.
As you were, gents.
This... is going to save Elizabeth?
How much do you know about Davey Jones?
Not much.
Yeah, it's gonna save Elizabeth.
Leave 'im lie... unless you're planning to use him to hit somethin' with.
Gentlemen... what do keys do?
Keys unlock... things?
And whatever this key unlocks, inside there's something valuable. So we're setting out to find whatever this key unlocks!
No. If we don't have the key, we can't open whatever it is we don't have that it unlocks. So what purpose would be served in finding whatever need be unlocked, which we don't have, without first having found the key what unlocks it?
So we're going after this key!
You're not making any sense at all.
Do we have a heading?
Ah! A heading! Set sail in a general...
*That* way direction.
If we can outrun her, we can take her. We should turn and fight.
Why fight when you can negotiate?
There will come a time when you have a chance to do the right thing.
I love those moments. I like to wave at them as they pass by.
Oi! Fishface! Lose something? Eh? Scungilli!
Got it! Come to negotiate, eh? Have you, you slimy git? Look what I got.
I got a jar of dirt, I got a jar of dirt, and guess what's inside it!
Come to join my crew, lad? Welcome aboard!
I'm here to find the man I love.
I'm deeply flattered, son, but my first and only love is the sea.
Meaning William Turner, Captain Sparrow.
Elizabeth!
Hide the rum.
Why is the rum always gone?
Oh... that's why.
Land is where you are safe, Jack Sparrow, and so you will carry land with you.
Dirt. This is a jar of dirt.
Yes.
...Is the jar of dirt going to help?
If you don't want it, give it back.
No!
Then it helps.
*Alas*, my children! This is the day you shall always remember as the day that you almost...
...Captain Jack Sparrow.
My tremendous intuitive sense of the female creature informs me that you are troubled.
You want me to find this?
No. You want you to find this, because the finding of this finds you incapacitorially finding and or locating in your discovering the detecting of a way to save your dolly belle, ol' what's-her-face. Savvy?
This is going to save Elizabeth?
How much do you know about Davy Jones?
Not much.
Yeah, it's going to save Elizabeth.
How did you get here?
Sea turtles, mate. A pair of them strapped to my feet.
Not so easy, is it?
You look bloody awful, what are you doing here?
You hired me. I can't help it if your standards are lax.
You smell funny.
So, we're setting out to find whatever this key unlocks?
No. If we don't have the key, we can't open whatever we don't have that it unlocks. So what purpose would be served in finding whatever need be unlocked, which we don't have, without first having found the key what unlocks it?
So, we're setting out to find this key?
Now you're not making any sense at all.
Is this a dream?
No.
I thought not. If it were, there'd be rum.

Let's put some distance between us and this island and head out to open sea!
Yes to the first, yes to the second, but only insofar as we keep to the shallows as much as possible.
That seems a bit contradictory, Captain.
I have every faith in your reconciliatory navigational skills, Mr. Gibbs, now where is that monkey, I want to shoot something!
So what's your plan, then?
I row over, search the ship until I find your bloody key.
And if there are crewmen?
I cut down anyone in my path.
I like it. Simple, easy to remember.
Do excuse me while I kill the man who ruined my life.
Be my guest.
Let us examine that claim for a moment, former Commodore, shall we? Who was it that, at the very moment you had a notorious pirate safely behind bars, saw fit to free said pirate and take your dearly beloved all to hisself, eh? So whose fault is it *really* that you've ended up a rum-pot deckhand what takes orders from pirates?
ENOUGH!
Unfortunately Mr. Turner, he's right!
Guard the boat, mind the tide... don't touch my dirt.
I wonder, Sparrow, can you live with this? Can you condemn an innocent man, a friend, to a lifetime of servitude in your name while you roam free?
Yep. I'm good with it.
Darling, I am truly unhappy to have to tell you this, but through an unfortunate and entirely unforeseeable series of circumstances that had nothing whatsoever to do with me, poor Will has been press-ganged into Davy Jones's crew.
You have a debt to pay. You've been captain of the Black Pearl for thirteen years. That was our agreement.
Technically, I was only captain for two years, then I was viciously mutinied upon.
Then you were a poor captain, but a captain nonetheless! Have you not introduced yourself all these years as ""Captain Jack Sparrow""?
Where's the Commodore?
He fell behind.
My prayers be with him.
Best not wallow in our grief!
We're not getting out of this.
Not with the chest. Into the boat.
You're mad.
Don't wait for me.
Uh, I say we respect his final wish.
The Black Spot!
The Black Spot!
Black Spot!
My eyesight's as good as ever, just so you know.
Thank you, Jack.
We're not free yet, love.
You came back. I always knew you were a good man.
It's after you, not the ship. It's not us. This is the only way, don't you see?
I'm not sorry.
Pirate.
It's real!
You actually were telling the truth.
I do that quite a lot. Yet people are always surprised.
With good reason.
You know I demand payment.
I brought payment. Look.
An undead monkey! Top that!

No...
You've no idea how long it took us to catch that.
The payment is fair...
Not quite according to plan...
Complications arose, ensued, were overcome.
Oh bugger.
So am I worthy to serve under Captain Jack Sparrow...
... or should I just kill you now?
You're hired!
Sorry. Old habits and all that.
Mr. Gibbs.
Captain.
We have a need to travel upriver.
By ""need,"" do you mean a trifling need? Fleeting? As in, say, a passing fancy?
No, a resolute and unyielding need.
We are very much alike, you and I, I and you... us.
Oh. Except for a sense of honor and decency and a moral center. And personal hygiene.
Trifles.
Jack, the letters, give them back.
No. Persuade me.
You do know Will taught me how to handle a sword.
As I said, persuade me.
Jack's hat!
Clear about!
No, no! Leave it!
Run!
Back to yer stations, the lot o' ye!
Jack?
Shhh.
For the love of Mother and Child, Jack, what's coming after us?
Nothing.
Not so bad...
Oh!
'Ello, beastie.
No, no! More wood! Big fire! I am chief! Want big fire!
You mistrust me? Listen, you can mistrust him, trust me.
You know that don't do no good.
It does me.
You have a touch of destiny about you, William Turner.
You know me?
You want to know me.
There'll be no knowing here! We've come for help and were not leaving without it.
I thought I knew you...
No worries! Tia Dalma and I go way back... thick as thieves, nigh inseparable we are... were... have been... before...
I'll watch yer back.
It's me front I'm worried about.
Mind the boat.
Mind the boat.
Mind the boat.
Mind the boat.
Mind the boat.
Mind the boat.
How are we going?
Including those four? That gives us... four.
Er, Mr. Gibbs...
Aye.
I feel sullied and unusual.
My compass is unique.
*Unique* here having the meaning of *broken*?
True enough.
You know, these clothes do not flatter you at all. It should be a dress or nothing. I happen to have no dress in my cabin.
Ah! A heading. Set sail in a... uh... a general... that way! direction.
I want my jar of dirt!
It's funny what a man will do to forestall his final judgment.
You made a deal with him too, Jack. He raised the Pearl from the depths for you. Thirteen years you've been her captain.
Technically...
You won't be able to talk yourself out of this. The terms that apply to me apply to you as well. One soul, bound to crew a hundred years upon his ship.
Yes, but the Flying Dutchmen already has a captain, so there's really...
Then it's the locker for you! Jones' terrible leviathan will find you, and drag the Pearl back to the depths and you along with it.
Any idea when Jones might release said terrible beastie?
I've already told you, Jack. Your time is up. He comes now.
She's only a ship, mate.
To what do I owe the pleasure of your carbuncle?
He sent me. Davy Jones.
You know of Davy Jones? A man of the sea, a great sailor. Until he run afoul of that which vexes all men.
What vexes all men?
What indeed.
The sea?
Sums?
The dichotomy of good and evil?
A woman.
A woman. He fell in love.
No, no, I heard it was the sea he fell in love with.
Same story, different versions. And all are true. See, it was a woman as changing and harsh and untamable as the sea. Him never stopped loving her. But the pain it caused was to much to live with, but not enough to cause him to die.
What exactly did he put into the chest?
Him heart.
Literally or figuratively?
He couldn't literally put his heart in a chest. Could he?
It was not worth feeling what small, fleeting joy life brings.
Gentlemen, what do keys do?

Lord Beckett desires the contents of that chest. I deliver it, I get my life back.
Ah. The dark side of ambition.

I thought not. If it were, there'd be rum.

Let's put some distance between us and this island and head out to open sea!
Yes to the first, yes to the second, but only insofar as we keep to the shallows as much as possible.
That seems a bit contradictory, Captain.
I have every faith in your reconciliatory navigational skills, Mr. Gibbs, now where is that monkey, I want to shoot something!
So what's your plan, then?
I row over, search the ship until I find your bloody key.
And if there are crewmen?
I cut down anyone in my path.
I like it. Simple, easy to remember.
Do excuse me while I kill the man who ruined my life.
Be my guest.
Let us examine that claim for a moment, former Commodore, shall we? Who was it that, at the very moment you had a notorious pirate safely behind bars, saw fit to free said pirate and take your dearly beloved all to hisself, eh? So whose fault is it *really* that you've ended up a rum-pot deckhand what takes orders from pirates?
ENOUGH!
Unfortunately Mr. Turner, he's right!
Guard the boat, mind the tide... don't touch my dirt.
I wonder, Sparrow, can you live with this? Can you condemn an innocent man, a friend, to a lifetime of servitude in your name while you roam free?
Yep. I'm good with it.
Darling, I am truly unhappy to have to tell you this, but through an unfortunate and entirely unforeseeable series of circumstances that had nothing whatsoever to do with me, poor Will has been press-ganged into Davy Jones's crew.
You have a debt to pay. You've been captain of the Black Pearl for thirteen years. That was our agreement.
Technically, I was only captain for two years, then I was viciously mutinied upon.
Then you were a poor captain, but a captain nonetheless! Have you not introduced yourself all these years as ""Captain Jack Sparrow""?
Where's the Commodore?
He fell behind.
My prayers be with him.
Best not wallow in our grief!
We're not getting out of this.
Not with the chest. Into the boat.
You're mad.
Don't wait for me.
Uh, I say we respect his final wish.
The Black Spot!
The Black Spot!
Black Spot!
My eyesight's as good as ever, just so you know.
Thank you, Jack.
We're not free yet, love.
You came back. I always knew you were a good man.
It's after you, not the ship. It's not us. This is the only way, don't you see?
I'm not sorry.
Pirate.
It's real!
You actually were telling the truth.
I do that quite a lot. Yet people are always surprised.
With good reason.
You know I demand payment.
I brought payment. Look.
An undead monkey! Top that!

No...
You've no idea how long it took us to catch that.
The payment is fair...
Not quite according to plan...
Complications arose, ensued, were overcome.
Oh bugger.
So am I worthy to serve under Captain Jack Sparrow...
... or should I just kill you now?
You're hired!
Sorry. Old habits and all that.
Mr. Gibbs.
Captain.
We have a need to travel upriver.
By ""need,"" do you mean a trifling need? Fleeting? As in, say, a passing fancy?
No, a resolute and unyielding need.
We are very much alike, you and I, I and you... us.
Oh. Except for a sense of honor and decency and a moral center. And personal hygiene.
Trifles.
Jack, the letters, give them back.
No. Persuade me.
You do know Will taught me how to handle a sword.
As I said, persuade me.
Jack's hat!
Clear about!
No, no! Leave it!
Run!
Back to yer stations, the lot o' ye!
Jack?
Shhh.
For the love of Mother and Child, Jack, what's coming after us?
Nothing.
Not so bad...
Oh!
'Ello, beastie.
No, no! More wood! Big fire! I am chief! Want big fire!
You mistrust me? Listen, you can mistrust him, trust me.
You know that don't do no good.
It does me.
You have a touch of destiny about you, William Turner.
You know me?
You want to know me.
There'll be no knowing here! We've come for help and were not leaving without it.
I thought I knew you...
No worries! Tia Dalma and I go way back... thick as thieves, nigh inseparable we are... were... have been... before...
I'll watch yer back.
It's me front I'm worried about.
Mind the boat.
Mind the boat.
Mind the boat.
Mind the boat.
Mind the boat.
Mind the boat.
How are we going?
Including those four? That gives us... four.
Er, Mr. Gibbs...
Aye.
I feel sullied and unusual.
My compass is unique.
*Unique* here having the meaning of *broken*?
True enough.
You know, these clothes do not flatter you at all. It should be a dress or nothing. I happen to have no dress in my cabin.
Ah! A heading. Set sail in a... uh... a general... that way! direction.
I want my jar of dirt!
It's funny what a man will do to forestall his final judgment.
You made a deal with him too, Jack. He raised the Pearl from the depths for you. Thirteen years you've been her captain.
Technically...
You won't be able to talk yourself out of this. The terms that apply to me apply to you as well. One soul, bound to crew a hundred years upon his ship.
Yes, but the Flying Dutchmen already has a captain, so there's really...
Then it's the locker for you! Jones' terrible leviathan will find you, and drag the Pearl back to the depths and you along with it.
Any idea when Jones might release said terrible beastie?
I've already told you, Jack. Your time is up. He comes now.
She's only a ship, mate.
To what do I owe the pleasure of your carbuncle?
He sent me. Davy Jones.
You know of Davy Jones? A man of the sea, a great sailor. Until he run afoul of that which vexes all men.
What vexes all men?
What indeed.
The sea?
Sums?
The dichotomy of good and evil?
A woman.
A woman. He fell in love.
No, no, I heard it was the sea he fell in love with.
Same story, different versions. And all are true. See, it was a woman as changing and harsh and untamable as the sea. Him never stopped loving her. But the pain it caused was to much to live with, but not enough to cause him to die.
What exactly did he put into the chest?
Him heart.
Literally or figuratively?
He couldn't literally put his heart in a chest. Could he?
It was not worth feeling what small, fleeting joy life brings.
Gentlemen, what do keys do?
Keys... unlock... *things*?
Walk the plank!
What did the bird say?
Jack, Elizabeth is in danger!
Have you considered keeping more watchful eye on her? Maybe just lock her up somewhere.
'Ello beastie.
You know, Lizzie, I happen to be captain of a ship. And, as captain, I could perform... a mar-i-age. Right here, on this deck, right now.
Can't let you do that, William. 'Cause if Jones is dead, who's to call his terrible beastie off the hunt, eh? Now, if you please. The key.
I keep the promises I make, Jack. I intend to free my father. I hope you're here to see it.
I can't let you do that, either. So sorry.
I knew you'd warm up to me eventually.
Lord Beckett desires the contents of that chest. I deliver it, I get my life back.
Ah. The dark side of ambition.
Oh, I prefer to see it as the promise of redemption.
Have you not met Will Turner? He's noble, heroic - terrific soprano. Worth at least four... maybe three and a half. And did I happen to mention... he's in love? With a girl. Due to be married. Betrothed. Dividing him from her and her from him would only be half as cruel as actually allowing them to be joined in holy matrimony, eh?
One word love: curiosity. You long for freedom. You long to do what you want to do because you want it. To act on selfish impulse. You want to see what it's like. One day you won't be able to resist.
Jones's terrible leviathan will find you, and drag the Pearl back to the depths and you along with it!
Any idea when Jones might release said terrible beastie?
I already told you, Jack. Your time is up.
It comes now, drawn with ravenous hunger to the man what bears the Black Spot.
The compass you bartered from me it cannot lead you to this?
Maybe. Why?
Ah, Jack Sparrow does not know what he wants.
Why doesn't your compass work?
...My compass works fine.
Savvy?
It's a key!
No! Much more better. It is a *drawing* of a key.
Still rooting for you, mate!
Lum se se, eunuch-y. Snip snip.
That's the Flying Dutchman? It doesn't look like much.
Neither do you. Do not underestimate.
Where is it? Where is the thump-thump?
You already have my payment. One soul to serve on your ship is already over there.
One soul is not equal to another.
Ah-ha! So, we've established my proposal as sound in principle. Now, we're just haggling over price.
As you were, gents.
This... is going to save Elizabeth?
How much do you know about Davey Jones?
Not much.
Yeah, it's gonna save Elizabeth.
Leave 'im lie... unless you're planning to use him to hit somethin' with.
Gentlemen... what do keys do?
Keys unlock... things?
And whatever this key unlocks, inside there's something valuable. So we're setting out to find whatever this key unlocks!
No. If we don't have the key, we can't open whatever it is we don't have that it unlocks. So what purpose would be served in finding whatever need be unlocked, which we don't have, without first having found the key what unlocks it?
So we're going after this key!
You're not making any sense at all.
Do we have a heading?
Ah! A heading! Set sail in a general...
*That* way direction.
If we can outrun her, we can take her. We should turn and fight.
Why fight when you can negotiate?"

Mother! I just told Professor Hill that I'd meet him at the footbridge in one hour.
Glory be, the saints be praised, it works!

I've been using the think system on you from the parlor!
You pile up enough tomorrows, and you'll find you've collected a lot of empty yesterdays.

About Professor Harold Hill. Gary Conservatory of Music, Gold-medal Class of aught-five. Harold, there wasn't any Gary Conservatory in aught-five.
Why, there certainly was...
Because the town wasn't even built until aught-six.
You knew all the time?

But if you knew, why didn't you...

Did you drop your...
No.
Didn't we meet in...
No.
I'll only be in town for a short while - I'll
Good.
Professor, you're a pretty bright young fellow. Ya made a couple of mistakes though.
Oh?
The mayor happens to own the billiard parlor and that new pool table.
Oh. What was the other mistake?
That Zaneeta? She's the mayor's oldest girl.
Eulalie, sit down!

And the rest of you. Standing there like a cote of Shropshire sheep. Have you people forgotten how you bought expensive uniforms, technical instruction books, and high priced band instruments? Have you forgotten the clear understanding and warranty that your children would be taught to play in a band? Well, where's the band? WHERE'S THE BAND?

Flynn Rider,N,Charmer,"All right, Blondie.
Rapunzel.
Gesundheit.
I've been looking out of a window for eighteen years, dreaming about what I might feel like when those lights rise in the sky. What if it's not everything I dreamed it would be?
It will be.
And what if it is? What do I do then?
Well, that's the good part I guess. You get to go find a new dream.
Who's that?
They don't like me.
Who's that?
They don't like me either.
Who's that?
Let's just assume for the moment that everyone in here doesn't like me!
Who are you, and how did you find me?
I know not who you are, nor how I came to find you, but may I just say... Hi. How ya doin'?
We made it.
Her hair glows!
We're alive. We're alive!
I didn't see that coming.
Eugene.
The hair actually glows.
Eugene.
Why does her hair glow!
Eugene!
What?
It doesn't *just* glow.
Why is he smiling at me?
Oh... oh no... where is my satchel?
I've hidden it. Somewhere you'll never find it.
It's in that pot, isn't it?
Rapunzel?
Eugene!
Did I ever tell you I've got a thing for brunettes?
Go. Live your dream.
I will.
Your dream stinks. I was talking to her.
That's a lot of hair.
She's growing it out.
Frying pans... who knew, right?
But I know what the big question is? Did Rapunzel and I ever get married? Well I am happy to say after years and years of asking, I finally said yes.
Eugene!
Okay, okay. I asked her.
And we're living happily ever after!
Yes we are.
I have made the decision to trust you.
A horrible decision really.
You smell that? Take a deep breath through the nose.
Really let that seep in. What are you getting? Because to me, that's part man-smell, and the other part is really bad man-smell. I don't know why, but overall it just smells like the color brown. Your thoughts?
Is it ruffians? Thugs? Have they come for me?
Stay calm. It can probably smell fear.
Something brought you here, Flynn Rider. Call it what you will... fate... destiny...
A horse.
I could get used to a view like this. Yep, I'm used to it. Guys I want a castle.
You should know that this is the strangest thing I've ever done!
... How 'bout best two out of three?
Let me just get this straight, I take you to see the lanterns, bring you back home, and you'll give me back my satchel?
I promise.
And when I promise something, I never ever break that promise.
EVER!
All right, listen! I didn't want to have to do this, but you leave me no choice. Here comes the smolder.
This is kind of an off-day for me. This doesn't normally happen.
Fine! I'll take you to see the lanterns.
Really?
Oops.
You broke my smolder.
No... no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, this is bad, this is very very bad, this is really bad... They just can't get my nose right!
Who cares?
Well, it's easy for you to say...
... You guys look amazing.
Head down.
Head down.
Arms in.
Arms in.
Knees apart.
Knees apart... Knees apart?
What about you?
I'm sorry, me?
What's your dream?
No, no no. Sorry, boys. I don't sing.
You were my new dream.
And you were mine.
The party lasted an entire week, and honestly, I don't remember most of it.
So, what do you want with my hair? To cut it?
What?
Sell it?
No! Listen, the only thing I want to do with your hair is to get out of it... lit-er-a-lly!
Is that blood in your mustache?
Goldie, look at this! Look at all the blood in his mustache! Good sir, that's a lot of blood!
This is the story of how I died. Don't worry, this is actually a very fun story and the truth is, it isn't even mine. This is the story of a girl named Rapunzel.

You know, I can't help but notice you seem a little at war with yourself here.
What?
Now, I'm only picking up bits and pieces here, of course. Overprotective mother, forbidden road trip. I mean, this is serious stuff. But let me ease your conscience. This is part of growing up. A little rebellion, a little adventure, that's good. Healthy, even.
You think?
I know. You're way over thinking this, trust me. Does your mother deserve it? No. Would this break her heart and crush her soul? Of course. But you've just got to do it.
Break her heart?
In half.
Crush her soul?
Like a grape.
She would be heartbroken. You're right.
I am, aren't I? Oh, bother.
All right. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm letting you out of the deal.
What?
That's right, but don't thank me. Let's turn around and get you home. Here's your pan, here's your frog.
I get back my satchel and you get back a mother-daughter relationship based on mutual trust, and violà, we part ways as unlikely friends.
No. I am seeing those lanterns.
Oh, come on! What is it going to take for me to get my satchel back?
I will use this.
Is this you?
Oh, now they're just being mean.
Hey, Max!
What? I bought them!
... *most* of them!
Ha! You should see your faces because you look -
... ridiculous.
So! Hey can I ask you something? Is there any chance that I'm going to get super strength in my hand? Because I'm not gonna lie, that would be stupendous... Hey, you alright?
Oh. Sorry yes, just... lost in thought I guess.
I mean because here's the thing. Superhuman good looks, I've always had them. Born with it. But superhuman strength, can you imagine the possibilities of this?
I have something for you too.
I should have given it to you before, but I was scared. And the thing is, I'm not scared anymore. You know what I mean?
I'm starting to.
So! You're being strangely cryptic as you wrap your magic hair around my injured hand.
Sorry! Just, don't... don't freak out.

Please don't freak out!
I'm not freaking out. Are you freaking out? No, I'm just very interested in your hair and the magical qualities that it possesses. How long has it been doing that, exactly?
Uh, forever, I guess. Mother says when I was a baby, people tried to cut it. They wanted to take it for themselves. But once it's cut, it turns brown and loses its power.
A gift like that, it has to be protected. That's why Mother never let me... that's why I never left, and...
You never left that tower. And you're still gonna go back?
No! Yes. Ugh. It's complicated. So, Eugene Fitzherbert, huh?
Yeah, well, I'll spare you the sob story of poor orphan Eugene Fitzherbert. It's a little bit of a... It's a little bit of a downer.
Huh. There was this book. A book I used to read every night to all the younger kids, ""The Tales of Flynnagan Rider."" Swashbuckling rogue, richest man alive, not bad with the ladies, either. Not that he'd ever brag about it, of course.
Hmm. Was he a thief, too?
Well, no. Actually he had enough money to do anything that he wanted to do. He could go anywhere that he wanted to go. And - and for a kid with nothing, I don't know. It just seemed like the better option. You can't tell anyone about this, okay? It could ruin my whole reputation.
Ah. We wouldn't want that.
Well, a fake reputation is all a man has. Um, well I should um... I - I should get some more firewood.
Hey. For the record, I like Eugene Fitzherbert much better than Flynn Rider.
Well, then you'd be the first. But thank you.
All right, okay, give me a boost, and I'll pull you up.
Give us the satchel first.
What? I just... I can't believe that after all we've been through together, you don't... trust me?
Ouch.
Now help us up, pretty boy.
Sorry... my hands are full.
Well, I hope you're here to apologize.
Well, I've gotta say, I didn't know you had that in you back there. That was pretty impressive.
I know!
I know. So, Flynn, where are you from?
Whoa, whoa. Sorry, blondie, I don't do backstory. However, I am becoming very interested in yours. Now, I know I'm not supposed to mention the hair.
Nope.
Or the mother.
Unh-unh.
Frankly, I'm too scared to ask about the frog.
Chameleon.
Nuance. Here's my question, though. If you want to see the lanterns so badly, why haven't you gone before?
Uh, heh, well...
Uh, Flynn?
Flynn?
Rider!
Run! Run!
This is all my fault. She was right. I never should've done this. I'm so, I'm so sorry, Flynn.
Eugene.
What?
My real name is Eugene Fitzherbert. Someone might as well know.
Hmm. I have magic hair that glows when I sing.
What?
I have magic hair that glows when I sing!
Flower, gleam and glow. Let your power shine.
What about you?
I'm sorry, me?
What's your dream?
No, no, no. Sorry boys, I don't sing.
I have dreams like you, no really, just much less touchy-feely, / They mainly happen somewhere warm and sunny, / On an island that I own, Tanned and rested and alone, / Surrounded by enormous piles of money.
I've got a dream,
She's got a dream,
I've got a dream,
She's got a dream,
I just want to see the floating lanterns gleam, / And with every passing hour, I'm so glad I left my tower, / Like all you lovely folks, I've got a dream.
She's got a dream, he's got a dream, / I've got a dream, he's got a dream, / So our differences ain't really that extreme, / We're one big team...
Call us brutal,
Say sadistic,
And grotesquely optimistic,

What's the password?
What?
Nope.
Open this door!
Not even close.
You have three seconds! One... two... three...
Huh?
Frying pans! Who knew, right?
Not the nose, not the nose, not the nose!
Put him down! Okay, I don't know where I am, and I need him to take me to see the lanterns, because I've been dreaming about them my entire life. Find your humanity! Haven't any of you ever had a dream?
I had a dream once.
I'm malicious, mean, and scary, my sneer could curdle dairy, and violence-wise, my hands are not the cleanest. But despite my evil look and my temper and my hook, I've always yearned to be a concert pianist.
Can't you see me on the stage, performing Mozart, Tickling the ivories 'till they gleam? Yep, I'd rather be called deadly, for my killer show tune medley.
Thank you!
'Cause way down deep inside I've got a dream!
He's got a dream, he's got a dream.
See, I ain't as cruel and vicious as I seem, though I feel like breaking femurs, you can count me with the dreamers, for like everybody else, I've got a dream!"

Careful.
I connect it with the ghouls under Siti Kasim.

Video game warriors escaping game grid. This is an illegal exit. You must return to game grid. Repeat! This is an illegal exit. You must return to the grid.
Gold-3 to Gold-2. Those demons are coming down.
Get them! Send out every game tank in the grid!
Get them!
This is the key to a new order. This code disk means freedom.
Did we make it?
Yeah.
Hooray for our side."
Man with No Name,E,Bounty Hunter,"Ten thousand... twelve thousand... fifteen... sixteen... seventeen... twenty-two. Twenty-two?
...Twenty-seven.
Any trouble, boy?
No, old man. Thought I was having trouble with my adding. It's all right now.
Tell me, Colonel... Were you ever young?
Yup. And just as reckless as you. Then one day, something happened. It made life very precious to me.
What's that?
Or is the question indiscreet?
No. No, the question isn't indiscreet. But the answer could be.
Alive or dead? It's your choice.
Two thousand dollars. It's a lot of money. Takes me three years to earn it!
Tell me, isn't the sheriff supposed to be courageous, loyal, and above all, honest?
Yeah. That he is.
I think you people need a new sheriff.
One from the outside one from the inside.There's no other way.One of us will have to join Indio's gang.
Why did you look at me when you said one of us?
Because they don't know you.Wild sees me and his hump will catch on fire.
Tell me Colonel.How do you propose that I join up with Indio?Maybe bring him a bunch of roses.
When two hunters go after the same prey, they usually end up shooting each other in the back. And we don't want to shoot each other in the back.
Then the Colonel dies...
I didn't hear what the bet was.
Your life.
There seems to be a family resemblance.
Here.
Naturally, between brother and sister.
That's the bank! As soon as I get some money, I'll put it in.
But you're gonna have to earn it first.
Very careless of you, old man.
Which way we headed?
North.
North? Along Rio Bravo Canyon?
Why not?
Seems like a pretty good place for an ambush to me.
You know a better way to go?
Yeah, south.
Hm... ride to the border?
How can somebody in my business go around with a contraption like this?
That contraption almost sent you to your grave.
Mister I didn't hear any shots at the bank.I sure would have.
You might hear one.The alarm.
I don't know him, I don't know him, I don't know him!
Come on now, you know everybody.
Don't know anybody anymore! I'm dead! Understand?
Well, there was a time when I knew everybody. That was a long time ago, when all this was prairie. But lately everybody's in a hurry, with your damned good-for-nothing trains!
Toot toot toot *tweet*!
Disgusting!
One day someone from the railroad comes here to see me and he says, 'Prophet, the railway's gonna go right past your house.' 'Oh, is that so?' I said. 'Mm-hm, yup that's right he says, 'All those trains gonna go right past here, and the best thing for you, Prophet, is to sell your land to the company or else we'll buy Baker's. He lives next to your place, and I'll put the tracks there, and that'll make you go crazy. What do you say, will you sell out to our company, Prophet?' ""Oh, is that so?' says I.
He was *very* anxious for me to sell out. You know what I told him about the railroad? You know what I told him he could do with his railroad?
You know what my decision about selling was?
Well, you said no.
You're right about that! No to him and his damn trains! I wouldn't, no!
Look, listen to me, old man! You're supposed to be a prophet, and I didn't come here to listen to you rattle on about trains! I want to find out about this man, it's obvious you don't know anything.
No need to be insulting! If that's all you came here to do, you can clear out of my house fast, before I lose my temper, understand?
*Say*! Where you going, hm?
I guess I better leave before you go and lose your temper!
My boy, you've become rich.
You mean *we've* become rich, old man.
No, it's all yours. I think you deserve it.
What about our partnership?
Maybe next time.
Take it to the station.The gentleman's leaving.
Hold it.Take it back.
Take it to the station.
Go inside.
The station.
Bravo.
Tell me, isn't the Sheriff supposed to be courageous, loyal, and above all honest?
Yeah, that he is.
I think you people need a new Sheriff.
Why this hotel and not some other?
You probably wouldn't that other place as much, signor. At that place you'd stay up half the night shooting cockroaches. At this hotel, the rooms will cost you so much less. And there's a landlady at this one, signor!
Married?
Yes, but she doesn't care!
You mind telling me how you got here?
I just reasoned it out. I figured you'd tell Indio to do just exactly the opposite of what we agreed, and he's suspicious enough to figure out something else. Since El Paso was out of the question, well, here I am!
Amigo why did you help me out?
Well that's such an high reward offered on all you gentlemen.That I thought I might just tag along on your next robbery.Might just turn you into the law.
Leave Indio to me.
Alright."
Jellon Lamb,E,Bounty Hunter,"Forgive me, sir, but I've been stuck here with no one but this sorry sack of Hibernian pig shit for conversation. Poor, poor Dan O'Reilly. Sit, sir. Drink with me.
One more crack about the Irish, Mr. Lamb, and I'll shoot you. Am I clear?
Oh, as the waters of Ennis, sir. Let us drink, then, to the Irish. No finer race of men have ever... peeled a potato.
Do you pray, Mr. Lamb?
There's night and day brother, both sweet things. Sun and Moon and stars, all sweet things. And quiet, there's a wind on the east. Life is very sweet, brother.
Life is very sweet, brother, who would wish to die?
Ah.
George Borrow, I believe. A worthy writer, and a beautiful sentiment sir. But you're not my brother.
""We are white men, Sir, not beasts. Oh, he sits up there in those melancholy hills; some say he sleeps in caves like a beast, slumbers deep like the Kraken. The Blacks say that he is a spirit. The Troopers will never catch him. Common force is meaningless, Mr. Murphy, as he squats up there on his impregnable perch. So I wait, Mr. Murphy. I wait.
Aye, you wait. You wait here... bounty hunter.
Do you pray, Mr. Lamb?
Good Lord, son, no, I do not. I was, in days gone by, a believer. But alas, I came to this beleaguered land, and the God in me just . . . evaporated. Let us change our toast, sir. To the God who has forgotten us.
Perhaps you've read ""On the Origin of the Species By Means of Natural Selection"" by Charles Darwin. Oh, don't be thrown by the title, he had some most fascinating things to say. Chilling things. Mr. Darwin spent time studying Aboriginals. He claims we are, at bottom, one in the same. He infers, Mr. Murphy, that we share a common ancestry with monkeys.
Monkeys!!!
What is an Irishman but a nigger turned inside out?
Mr. Murphy, Russia, China, the Congo, oh, I have traveled among unknown people in lands beyond the seas. But nothing, *nothing* could have prepared me for this godforsaken hole."
Beck,E,Bounty Hunter,"Mr Hatcher, are you out there?
What can I do for you, Mr. Beck?
I have no desire to fight with you or your men. For that reason you have two options. Option A, you leave the Gato and the girl, and you walk out of town no questions asked.
What's option B?
Option B? I make you.
Wrong choice.
Lock down the town.
Let me get this straight - you never use guns?
No.
Never.
Never.
What if your best friend was gonna die, you wouldn't pick up a gun?
No guns.
Santa Claus would pick up a gun to save his best friend.
Do I look like Santa Claus? Do I look like Santa Claus to you?
What do you say? Guns make you whooh-poco-loco? Bang-bang-crazy?
I pick up guns, bad things happen to people. I don't like that.
What kind of things?
Very bad things, Travis. Walk.
What about knives?
Move.
Hey, remember your friend, Mr. Thunder? How 'bout his buddy, Mr. Lightning? Ooh, I know you know him. You know him real well, don't ya?
I'm just playing, man. I'll be in the truck.
I'm gonna kill you.
When I'm a guest in another man's house, I don't reach into his refrigerator without asking permission.
Manito wants to know who you think would win a fight between Mike Tyson and Muhammed Ali.
Ali, hands down.
He says, what about Tyson's power?
Shit. Tell him Ali would have done to Tyson what he did to Foreman in Africa.
Ah, Rumble. Rumble in the Jungle.
Tell him Ali was too smart.

Too smart, too fast. He would have used his jabs, bam, bam. He would have danced, played with his mind. Before you know it, bam. left to the body, bam. right to the head. Down goes Tyson.
Float like butterfly.
Sting like bee.
Oh, thit...
What? What?
Monkey! Monkey!
Monkey? Where? Get him away from me!
Get out of here, Monkey.
Get out of here, Monkey.
Get out of here, Monkey.
Oh, no...
I hate this place. I hate penis-eating minnows and I hate freaky fruit. I want to go home. I want concrete. I want homemade tortellini. I want my Los Angeles Lakers. I want to go home, I want to go home, I WANT TO GO HOOOOOOME!
Get out of here, monkeys! Get out of here, monkeys!
You know, back in the States, Brazil nuts like these go for $ a lb.
Well, those fell of the tree out back. And around here, we don't call them Brazil nuts.
What do you call them?
Well, we are in Brazil, so we just call them nuts.
Fair enough.
You done beatin' me up? Let's go.
I can't get it out! Do you think you could-?
No. Hell, no.
I'm just saying that whatever my father is paying you, I will double it.
No.
I'll quadruple it.
No.
I'll double it and quadruple it.
No.
You're being unreasonable.
Tell 'em to dig harder! If only it were that simple, eh, Mr. Beck?
How do you know my name?
When a man of your dimensions travels all this way to visit a place like this... it... arouses the curiosity.
I don't make deals with people like you.
You don't even know me.
You're just like every other jackass that I've taken down. First they try to run, then they try to fight, then they try to negotiate. And when that doesn't work, you're gonna do what all the others do when they realize it's over.
Oh, yeah? What's that?
You're gonna get down on your hands and knees and you're gonna beg me for a break. Well, guess what? I don't give breaks. No breaks.
You don't understand the situation.
You borrowed money from the guy. You shot the wrong guy. You slept with the wrong guy's wife. I-don't-care. Your mistake.
Have you ever heard of the Gato du Diabo? It's a priceless object, forged out of pure gold. It's worth millions.
I thought you said it was priceless.
You do not want to argue semantics with a PhD candidate.
PhD?
Yeah, I am very close to being Dr. Travis Walker.
You dropped out of Stanford after two semesters, Einstein.
I need you to make a choice for me.
What choice?
Option A or Option B. Option A: we walk out of here nice and easy, we go back to the airstrip, and then we begin our long journey back to Los Angeles. There'll be no bruises, no broken bones, and no problems.
What's in Los Angeles?
Your father.
What's Option B?
Pretty much the opposite of A. But I wouldn't recommend that one.
Knapmiller, you have two choices. Option ""A,"" you give me the ring. Option ""B,"" I *make* you give me the ring.
What are you doing?
I have to pee.
Pee in your pants, move!
No!
Excuse me?
I've let you push me around this jungle for like five hours. Now if you wanna keep going, you're just gonna have to carry me. I guarantee I'm gonna pee on your head.
You're threatening me? You're threatening me with pee?
Yeah... If you don't let me pee here.
Fine, you win, pee!
Will you unzip me?
No, I'm not gonna unzip you. You have 30 seconds, PEE!
How am I supose to pee with my hands cuffed behind my back?
Find a way!
Tell him I don't want to fight him.
He says he pisses on your ancestors, and that you would make a very pretty bride!
I'll give you one more chance to reconsider.
I'll give you one more chance to shut your mouth.
Is that your final answer?
Don't pee in the water.
Why?
A candiru, a vicious parasite will swim up the urine into your pau.
Swim up my what?
Your pinto. It'll swim up your ding-dong. And once it gets in, you can't get it out.
Well, then what?
They have to amputate.
Not this boy's pinto. Uh-uh, not today!
So, wait a minute. She gets what she needs, you get what you need, and I get the shaft?
I could always give her back the gun.
I really don't like you.
Yeah well, I get that a lot.
American?
Yeah.
Where from?
Someplace that's got bartenders.
You got a problem with guns?
Let's just say they take me to a place I don't wanna go.
Where do they take you?
To a place you don't wanna see me go. WALK.
How often do you work out?
It's me. Oh yeah, he's here. But there's a problem, he's got the entire offensive line here. That's right, the entire offensive line. Why don't we just do this another night? Listen, they've got a legitimate shot at repeating this year, I do not want to hurt them.
For what its worth, I hope you enjoy the fall.
What fall?
This fall...
Who gives a shit?
I paid you.
Well, fortunately, I had my fingers crossed the whole time.
Not so fast, jungle boy!
Hey! I've got the keys to your cuffs.
Oh, shit...
I'll tell you what you've got, pal. You've got problems.
Will you look at that, we can't land now.
Why? Why can't we land?
Look, they got the bulls on the ground!
""Bools on the grind""?
Aye, the bulls! The cattle, look!
Is this the only road in and out?
If you want to stay alive.
Why is that?
That, there! That's the jungle, little fella. You've got anacondas in there, poison arrow frogs, black flies, bullet ants. If they don't get you, the rebels will.
What-? What is this?
Hoo, hoo, hoo! Welcome to the jungle, tough guy!
Who do you think you are? You come into my town, you mess up my bar, you eyeball my woman...
Eyeball your woman?
Oh... it's on now.
I'm looking for a man.
What's your type?
His name's Travis Walker.
He's in his twenties, he's got sandy hair, a beard, wearing a blue shirt and jeans, right now he's got a real bewildered look on his face."
Rick Deckard,"AN, E","Hardboiled Detective, Bounty Hunter","You've done a man's job, sir. I guess you're through, huh?
Finished.
It's too bad she won't live! But then again, who does?
I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before. Not just his life - anybody's life; my life. All he'd wanted were the same answers the rest of us want. Where did I come from? Where am I going? How long have I got? All I could do was sit there and watch him die.
Do you like our owl?
It's artificial?
Of course it is.
Must be expensive.
Very.
I'm Rachael.
Deckard.
It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Replicants are like any other machine - they're either a benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
She's a replicant, isn't she?
I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot them?
I don't get it, Tyrell.
How many questions?
Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
She doesn't know.
She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
May I ask you a personal question?
Sure.
Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
No.
But in your position, that is a risk.
Leon!
How old am I?
I dunno.
My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Four years.
More than you! Painful to live in fear, isn't it?
Six! Seven! Go to Hell or go to Heaven!
Go to Hell!
GOOD! THAT'S THE SPIRIT!

Gaff had been there, and let her live. Four years, he figured. He was wrong. Tyrell had told me Rachael was special. No termination date. I didn't know how long we had together... Who does?
Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Like what?
Well... well, like to get this job. I mean, did... did you do, or... or were you asked to do anything lewd... or unsavory, or... or, otherwise repulsive to your... your person, huh?
Are you for real?
Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
I'm not in the business... I *am* the business.
I was quit when I come in here, Bryant, I'm twice as quit now.
Stop right where you are! You know the score, pal. You're not cop, you're little people!
No choice, huh?
No choice, pal.

No... No, I wouldn't. I owe you one... But somebody would.

Remember when you were six? You and your brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window. You were going to play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your turn you chickened and ran; you remember that? You ever tell anybody that? Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? Remember the spider that lived outside your window? Orange body, green legs. Watched her build a web all summer, then one day there's a big egg in it. The egg hatched...
The egg hatched...
Yeah...
...and a hundred baby spiders came out... and they ate her.
Implants. Those aren't your memories, they're somebody else's. They're Tyrell's niece's.
O.K., bad joke... I made a bad joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, O.K.? No, really - I'm sorry, go home.

Go someplace else?
We're in the clear. Running fast. North on the old Richter route passed the mountains. I told her about Batty on the roof dying, making every second count. I told her I loved her. She told me it was the happiest day of her life. She told me she loved me too. I figured I wouldn't get the headaches or the shakes anymore, not for a while. It was good enough for me, I hope it was good enough for her.
I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on Moral Abuses.
Fish?
I think it was manufactured locally... finest quality... superior workmanship. There is a maker's serial number... 9-9-0-6-9-4-7-X-B-7-1. Interesting. *Not* fish. *Snake* scale!

Sushi. That's what my ex-wife called me - cold fish.
Gaff had been there and let her live. 4 years he figured. He was wrong. Tyrell had told me Rachel was special. No termination date. I didn't know how long we had together. Who does?
Deckard. B26354.
That isn't really my kind of place.
Go someplace else?
We're in the clear. Running fast. North on the old Richter route passed the mountains. I told her about Batty on the roof dying, making every second count. I told her I loved her. She told me it was the happiest day of her life. She told me she loved me too. I figured I wouldn't get the headaches or the shakes anymore, not for a while. It was good enough for me, I hope it was good enough for her.
I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on Moral Abuses.
Fish?
I think it was manufactured locally... finest quality... superior workmanship. There is a maker's serial number... 9-9-0-6-9-4-7-X-B-7-1. Interesting. *Not* fish. *Snake* scale!"
Leonard Smalls,E,Bounty Hunter,"Name's Smalls. Leonard Smalls. My friends call me Lenny... only I ain't got no friends.
You want to find an outlaw, hire an outlaw. You want to find a Dunkin' Donuts, call a cop.
You want that $25,000 reward, you go ahead and claim it. What's there to talk about?
Price. A fair price. That's not what you say it is, and it's not what I say it is... It's what the market will bear. Now there's people - and I know 'em - who'll pay a lot more than $25,000 for a healthy baby. Why, I myself fetched $30,000 on the black market. And that was in 1954 dollars.
I got the cops and the Federal BI out there lookin' for my boy...
Cops won't find your boy. A cop couldn't find his butt if it had a bell on it.
If you're looking for furniture or a shitbox, out there is the sales floor.
I'm not a customer. I'm a manhunter. But I do hunt babies on occasion. I heard tell you got one you can't put your hand to.
How do you know about that?
That's my job. I'm a tracker. Some say part hound dog."
Jack Walsh,E,Bounty Hunter,"Where am I? I'm in Boise, Idaho. No, no, no, wait a minute, I'm in Anchorage, Alaska. No, no, wait, I'm in Casper, Wyoming. I'm in the lobby of a Howard Johnson's and I'm wearing a pink carnation.
What the fuck are you talking about?
I am not talking to you, I am talking to the other guys.
What other guys?
Well, let me describe the scene to you. There are these guys, see? They've probably been up for like two days. They stink of B.O., they have coffee breath, they're constipated from sittin' on their asses for so long, they're sitting in a van, and they're probably parked right up the street from your office, Eddie. YOUR PHONE IS TAPPED!
Did she hurt you, Jack?
Yeah, she did.
I'm sorry.
What're you sorry about?
I'm sorry you're hurt.
I'm not hurt.
You just said you were hurt.
I'm not hurt.
You just said you were hurt!
I didn't say I was hurt, YOU said I was hurt.
I asked you if you were hurt and you said ""Yeah, I'm hurt.""
That's because you made me say it. Startin' to put words in my mouth.
Jack, you're a grown man. You're in control of your own words.
You're goddamn right I am. Now here come two words for you: Shut the fuck up.
I can't keep you cuffed on a commercial flight, and I gotta check my gun with my luggage, but you fuck with me once and I'm gonna break your neck.
I can't fly.
What?
You heard me, I can't fly.
No, no, no. You're going to have to do better than that, pal.
No, I don't have to do better than that, because it's the truth, I can't fly: I suffer from aviaphobia.
What does that mean?
It means I can't fly. I also suffer from acrophobia and claustrophobia.
I'll tell you what: if you don't cooperate, you're gonna suffer from ""fistophobia"".

You wouldn't have change for a thousand, would ya?
Whatta ya, a comedian? Get outta here, you bum!
Looks like I'm walkin'.
What happened to the goddamn plane?
He doesn't like to fly.
He doesn't like to fly? What the fuck does that mean? Listen to me, Jack. You've gotta be here in less than two and a half fuckin' days! A half a million dollars of my money... WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON THERE?
Eddie, Eddie, I swear to God, don't start with me or so help me, I will shoot him and dump him in a fuckin' swamp!
I know my rights. You owe me phone calls.
What should be of paramount importance to you right now is not the phone calls. It's the fact that you're gonna spend ten years for impersonating a federal agent.
Ten years for impersonating a fed, huh?
Ten years.
How comes no one's after you?
Jahé, everybody, jahé
What's that?
It means 'hello'. I can say 'hello' in a lot of different languages. Not yours, but a lot of them.
Two dollars? That's all you're gonna leave?
That's fifteen percent.
That's thirteen percent. These people depend on tips for a living!
Let me tell you something, asshole. I've been working on this Jimmy Serrano thing for about six years; Mardukas is my shot. I'm gonna bring him into federal court, and I don't want any third-rate rent-a-thug who couldn't cut it as a cop in Chicago bringing him to LA on some bullshit local charge. Do I make myself understood?
Can I ask you something? These sunglasses, they're really nice: are they government-issued, or all you guys go to the same store to get them?
You lied to me first!
What the - -YOU LIED TO ME FIRST!
Yes! Yes. But you didn't know I was lying to you when you lied to me down by the river. So as far as you knew, you lied to me first!
How can I argue with this guy. I don't know what the fuck he's talking about.
Oh Marvin, you did it this time!
What the fuck are you talking about?
Those were hired killers back there!
Hired to kill who?
Hired to kill this guy!
Me! Me, can you believe it?
Hired by who?
Hired by who? Jimmy Serrano, that's who!
Oh, fuck! Why they wanna kill this guy?
Don't you read the papers, knucklehead?
Yeah, I read the fuckin' papers!
I can't take this.
Are you gonna propose to me?
Propose?
Propose! Because if you're not, quit starin' at me, OK?
How much is here?
Neighborhood of three hundred thousand.
That's a, that's a... very respectable neighborhood.
I never took a payoff in my life and I'm not gonna start with someone like you.
Why not?
Because you're a fucking criminal and you deserve to go where you're going and I'm gonna take you there and if I hear any more shit outta you: I'm gonna fucking bust your head and I'll put you back in that fucking hole and I'm gonna stick your head in the fucking toilet bowl and I'm gonna make it stay there.
I got money, y'know.
I'm sure you do.
I'll give you whatever you want.
Start by shutting up. I know you all of two minutes and already I don't like ya.
Gee, that's too bad. I really like you.
I know you had money. I didn't know you HAD money.
You can't steal a truck !
You were stealing a plane !
You put Marvin on this case you fuckin' piece of shit? You fucking, deceptive - You VERMIN! You SLIMEBALL in a SEA of PUS!
Let's go have some breakfast.
I don't eat breakfast.
Well then have an early lunch, let's go!
... I'm calling to tell you though that you're a dead mother fucker, you understand me?
That whole fuckin' department was corrupt!
There's good and bad everywhere, don't you think?
Eh, well, I'd say there's bad everywhere. Good I don't know about.
You ever had sex with an animal Jack? Remember those chickens on the Indian reservation? There were some good looking chickens there Jack. You know, between us...
Yeah, there were a couple there I might've taken a shot at.
Come on, cigarettes are killers.
So are women.
We are getting off here, Mr. Railroad Man!
Can I have my sunglasses please?
Here's your sunglasses.
Nice.
Thanks for this too.
What you think Serrano is most afraid of?
going cross-country with you!
Why don't you put the cigarette out.
Why don't you shut up and leave me alone?
Put the cigarette out, Jack.
What a...
Put the cigarette out.
What a pain in the ass this guy is.
I thought you were putting it out.
No I'm not putting it out.
Why aren't you popular with the Chicago Police Department.
You ever had lyonnaise potatoes? They are these types of potatoes that are sautéed but then they have this onion thing added to them, and they are really, really delicious. They work well with any, uh, chicken or pork dish. You know I could set you up with lyonnaise potatoes for the rest of your life.
Why don't you just shut the fuck up!
Shit!
You wouldn't happen to have change of a thousand, would ya?
What are you, a comedian? Get out of here, ya bum!
Well, looks like I'm walkin'.
Jack you shouldn't be here. Ted will come arrest you and him.
Arrest us?
Yeah.
Then we're in trouble because I'm afraid I'm little short of bribe money.
All right Jack, don't.
How is Lieutenant whatever-his-name-is?
It's captain now.
Oh, captain! Royalty!
Jack, I don't want any trouble. Do you understand that? Please. It's not a good day for this. I mean it!
I'm sorry my fugitive timetable doesn't coincide with your social calendar.
I don't think she's saying that.
Stay out of this, John.
All right, same old Jack. You get your feelings hurt then you just walk around and hurt everybody else.
The last thing I need right now is one of your lectures.
I'm not lecturing you, stupid! I'm trying to protect you.
Oh, come on.
Ted will be home any minute. We're all going out tonight. It's an important night for us.
Important night? What so important about tonight? Wait, let me guess. What is it, pay-off night?
All right, that's it. Get out!
When have I ever, when have I ever let you down before you fucking rat?
Deal, what deal? Why does he get special treatment?
See you in L.A. Marvin.
Yeah, well watch your cigarettes with this guy, Jack!
I'm goin' over to Chen Lu's for breakfast, I'll talk to you about it over there.
Can I get my money first?
Of course. What, do you think I was gonna try to stiff you?
You? Never. You would never try to stiff me.
Do I detect some kind of sarcasm here?
Never.
Where have I inherited this reputation? I have never done business with anybody, and Jerry is my witness, that I have ever, ever, ever... has that phone ever rang... has that phone ever rang with a complaint about me? Never... Never! So let's go, I'll buy you some breakfast.
You don't look like an FBI agent to me.
Well, you don't look like a duke to me.
What's that for?
A little inside joke between me and Alonzo.
I've known you for all of two mins & already I don't like you
gee that's too bad coz I really like you
Why would you eat that?
Why? 'Cause it tastes good.
But it's not good for you.
I'm aware of that.
Why do something that you know is not good for you?
Because I don't think about it.
Well, that's living in denial.
Living in denial?
Yeah.
I'm aware of that.
So you're aware of all your behavior?
yet you continue to do things that aren't good for you.
That sounds sort of foolish. Don't you think, Jack?
You can FLY, you son of a bitch?
What am I telling you for... What am I telling you for... What am I... I'll tell you what I'm telling you for
Where the hell are you?
Where am I? I'm at the airport! And guess who I'm with? I'm with the Duke!
You got him! Oh! You got him, Jack! I love you!
Yeah, you wanna say hello?
Yeah, put him on.
Yeah, say hello!
Hello.
Hello, you son of a bitch! We got you, you son of a bitch!
Yeah! Now say goodbye, you lying little piece of shit, because I'm letting him go!
Jack?"
Milo Boyd,E,Bounty Hunter,"Life is making mistakes.
And death is wishing you had made more.
Milo, please, you have got to let me out of here.
Hmm... nope!
All right, I shouldn't have run away, you just caught me off guard. And the truth is, I think I might need your advice on something.
Well, that's a real shame. Because I wouldn't help you if you were the last baby sea turtle dragging your little, tiny body across the burning sand whilst hungry seagulls circled overhead. No, I'd just pull up a chair, sip a pina colada and watch nature take its course.
Nic... Nicole?
Please stop...
Hey, remember how we used to be in love?
Yeah.
Well, that means I know when you're crying for real, and when you're faking it! Bye-bye!
Oh! God, Milo!
Oh, God... so good.
All I know is, I'm out 50,000 if she's not in that courtroom Monday morning.
Wait, you're telling me that I'll get five grand to go pick up my ex-wife and bring her to jail?
You're a good listener.
Ah, using your one phone call to phone in a story. That is so you.
What are you doing here?
Hey, it's a special night. There's no way we're not spending it together. Hey, can we go in the same cell?
Get in the cell, dickhead.
All right, I'm going.
Why do people do that?
Why do people do what?
Deny that they've ever done anything wrong in the relationship - why can't people take responsibility for their shit and move on?
Can't we talk about this?
Fine. What do you want to say?
I am not letting you take me to jail.
Duly noted. Let's go.
Are you trying to seduce me?
Yeah.
What's the hottest thing about me? That would be my gun.
No, you have got to be kidding! You cannot be putting me in the trunk! You cannot be seri-!
I'm dead ""seri""!
You see, what I do is, I hunt down criminals. Idiots who jump bail, specifically.
You are a bounty hunter?
Yeah. And much as it pains me to say this, and it really does, I gotta take you to jail.
Oh, what? You're gonna shoot me?
Nope.
I'm gonna shoot a cab driver.
Oh, no, no, no, he doesn't mean it!
Yep, I mean it.
Ah, chicken shits!
You're not gonna shoot another cop are ya?
I'm the only cop here
Now that's just hurtful"
Toombs,E,Bounty Hunter,"If I owned this place and Hell, I'd rent this place out and live in Hell.
Don't bother. Guards ain't there. They figured out the Necros are comin' for me. Plan was to clean the bank, ghost the mercs, break wide for the tunnel. And then somebody got a lucky shot off with this rocket launcher here... and took out the sled. Guards took off on foot but rigged the door so no one could follow. They'll take the one ship in the hangar and leave everyone else to die.
How come you know all this shit? You weren't even here.
Cause it was my plan.
I shoulda taken the money.
You know, you supposed to be some slick-shit killer. Now look at you... all back-of-the-bus and shit.
Two days out. Con in the back is named Speedo. Don't know where he got that, he looks pretty fuckin' slow at the moment.
Shut up back there!"
Nick Randall,E,Bounty Hunter,"Fuck the bonus.
Come on, kill me.
I'm not a criminal, I'm a soldier and I deserve to die, like a soldier.
Your not a soldier, your a fly on a pile of shit.
Less than a week and still alive you owe me some money.
Where shall I send the cheque?
Send the two-hundred and fifty thousand dollars to the widow of Det Sgt Danny Quintz, the bonus I'll pick up myself.
Fuck the bonus
Grenade
Randall...
We've been seeing each other for six months now.
Six months? Six fucking months? That's a goddamn sivler anniversary for you!"
Max Goldman,AM,Grumpy Old Man,"Do me a favor. Put your lip over your head... and swallow.
When I had my ulcers, I was farting razor blades.
Good morning, dickhead.
Hello, moron.
You know what Jacob said? Jacob said old Billy Hensel was killed in a car crash. Cleared his car straight off the bridge into the Mississippi.
Lucky bastard.
You bet.
Hey, how is he, anyway?
Dead! Died on impact!
Jacob, moron, Jacob!
You're a child.
Don't tell me Jacob; it isn't me.
Oh it never is. Uh huh, I'm sure John started every fight since 1940.
38!
You're trying to steal her away like you did Mae.
Oh, well, I'll remind you, Einstein, that Mae was no prize.
She was to me.
I was married to the woman for 20 years, she was no prize!
She was to me.
Well, that's why you're a moron! If you'd had Mae you wouldn't have had Amy! And Amy was a good woman!
She was the best.
Yeah, and she was a darned sight more loyal than Mae ever was!
Yeah!
Yeah.
What?
What?
Huh?
Huh?
What...?
If I had known I would be doing a nude scene, I'd have asked for another million.
You mean the low-life, ass-wipe, egg-sucker John Gustafson?
Have you seen him?
The man's crazy. Loco. Always hanging out around those kinky strip bars. You know, the ones where the men take their clothes off. That's of course if he's taken his medication.
Medication?
Yes, without it he could be anywhere. Wandering around talking to the trees. I'm telling you the man's a menace, he's always drinking, starting fights.
Up yours, Gustafson.
Hey dickhead you win the lottery?
Did you win the Lottery Dickhead?
Enjoy your shower Smart Ass?
Hey, watch your mouth you dumb friggin' Swede.
Who's the guy yakkin' at your door?
Just mind your own business, will ya?
Mind your own business, will ya? Mind your own business. Why don't you tie your shoelace, you'll fall on your stupid head.
Cold enough for ya? Brrrrrrr!
Oh, shut up, fatass!
Moron!
Putz!
John! John! Are you dead?
Not yet. But I don't want to die looking at your ugly face.
She chose me, and anyone who says different is a damn liar!
Gotta use *hot* water, dickhead!"
Walt Kowalski,AM,Grumpy Old Man,"What you lookin' at old man?
Ever notice how you come across somebody once in a while you shouldn't have fucked with? That's me.
There. You finally look like a human being again. You shouldn't wait so long between hair cuts, you cheap son of a bitch.
Yeah. I'm surprised you're still around. I was always hoping you'd die off and they got someone in here that knew what the hell they were doing. Instead, you're just hanging around like the doo-wop dago you are.
That'll be ten bucks, Walt.
Ten bucks? Jesus Christ, Marty. What are you, half Jew or somethin'? You keep raising the damn prices all the time.
It's been ten bucks for the last five years, you hard-nosed Polack son of a bitch.
Yeah, well keep the change.
See you in three weeks, prick.
Not if I see you first, dipshit.
Oh, I've got one. A Mexican, a Jew, and a colored guy go into a bar. The bartender looks up and says, ""Get the fuck out of here.""
I'll blow a hole in your face then go inside and sleep like a baby.
Get off my lawn!
What can I do for you Walt?
I'm here for confession.
Holy Jesus, what did you do?
Why didn't you call the police?
Well you know, I prayed for them to come but nobody answered.
I think you're an overeducated 27-year-old virgin who likes to hold the hands of superstitious old ladies and promise them everlasting life.
Now you just gotta learn how guys talk. You just listen to the way Martin and I banter it back and forth. You OK? You're ready?
Sir!
Alright let's go in...
Perfect! A Polak and AND a Chink!
How ya doing Martin, you crazy Italian prick?
Walts! You cheap bastard! I should have known you'd come in, I was having such a pleasant day!
What'd you do? You ruse some poor blind guy out of his money? Gave him the wrong change?
Who's the Nip?
Ohh... He's a pussy kid from next door. I'm trying to man him up a little bit... You see kid, now that's how guys talk to one another.
They do?
What, you got shit on your ribs?
Now you go out and come back in and talk to him like a man, like a REAL man. Come on! Get your ass outta here! Come on back now.
Sorry about this.
What's up ya old Italian prick?
Get out of my shop before I blow your head off, you goddamn dick sucker! Go!
Jezus Christ, Holy Shit! Hehe. Take it easy, take it easy!
What the hell are you doing? Have you lost your mind?
But that's what you said. That's what you said men say.
You don't just come in and insult the man in his own shop! You just don't do that. What happens if you meet some stranger? You get the wrong one, he's gonna blow your gook head right off!
What should I have said then?
Well... why don't you start with... eeehm... Hi or Hello...
Yeah, just come in and say... eeeehm... Sir, I'd like a haircut if you have the time.
Yeah, be polite, but don't kiss ass.
In fact you could talk about a construction job you just came from and bitch about your girlfriend and your car.
eeeehm... Son of a bitch, I just got my brakes fixed and eeehmm those son of bitches really nailed me, I mean they screwed me right in the ass!
Yeah, don't swear AT the guy, just talk about people who are not in the room... eeeh... you could talk about your boss... eeeh... making you work extra time when there is bowling night.
Right, or... eeeh... my old lady bitches for two goddamn hours about how... eeeeh... they don't take expired coupons at the grocery stores. And the minute I turn on the fucking game, she starts crying how we never talk!
I once fixed a door that wasn't even broken yet.
Take these three items, some WD-40, a vise grip, and a roll of duct tape. Any man worth his salt can fix almost any problem with this stuff alone.
Are you fucking crazy? Go back in the house.
Yeah? I blow a hole in your face and then I go in the house... and I sleep like a baby. You can count on that. We used to stack fucks like you five feet high in Korea... use ya for sandbags.
I used to stack fucks likes you five feet high in Korea... use ya for sand bags.
Relax, zipperhead. I'm not gonna shoot you. I'd look down too, if I was you. You know, I knew you were a dipshit the first time I ever saw you. Then I thought you were worse with women than stealing cars... Toad.
It's Thao.
What?
It's not Toad, my name is Thao.
Yeah, well, you were blowing it with that girl who was there. Not that I give two shits about a toad like you.
You don't know what you're talking about.
You're wrong, eggroll, I know exactly what I'm talking about. I may not be the most pleasant person to be around, but I got the best woman who was ever on this planet to marry me. I worked at it, it was the best thing ever happened to me. Hands down. But you, you know, you're letting Click-Clack, Ding-Dong and Charlie Chan just walk out with Miss What's-her-face. She likes you, you know? Though I don't know why!
Who?
Yum Yum. You know, the girl in the purple sweater. She's been looking at you all day, stupid!
You mean Youa?
Yeah... Yum Yum... yeah... nice girl... nice girl, very charming girl... I talked with her... yeah. But you, you just let her walk out right out with the Three Stooges. And you know why? 'Cause you're a big fat pussy. Well, I gotta go. Good day, pussycake.
You're funny.
I've been called a lot of things, but never funny.
What the hell does everybody want with my Gran Torino?
You wanna know what it's like to kill a man? Well, it's goddamn awful, that's what it is. The only thing worse is getting a medal... for killing some poor kid that wanted to just give up, that's all. Yeah, some scared little gook just like you. I shot him in the face with that rifle you were holding in there a while ago. Not a day goes by that I don't think about it, and you don't want that on your soul.
I confess that I have no desire to confess.
You should quit. Those things are bad for you.
Yeah? So's being in a gang.
I don't care about him.
You hang out with him, you teach him to fix things, you saved him from that fucked cousin of ours.
Watch your language, lady.
And you're a better man to him than our own father was. You're a good man.
There's a ton of food.
Yeah, well just keep your hands off my dog.
No worries, we only eat cats.
I'm here for a confession.
Oh, Lord Jesus what have you done?
You got your whole life ahead of you, but for me, I finish things.
The old hag hates my guts!
Get me another beer, Dragon Lady! This one's running on empty.
What are you spooks up to?
Go in peace.
Oh, I am at peace.
Hey Kennedy: You drunken Irish goon, how the hell are ya?
I'm shitty, but who's gonna listen?
Not me, that's for sure
Oh, uh, help yourself there, Walt. You dumb Pollack.
What was it like to kill someone?
You don't want to know.
Would it kill you to buy American?
I worked in Ford for 50 years and he sells Japanese cars.
Shut your fuckin' face!
I'm no hero. I was just trying to get that babbling gook off my lawn!
All the people in this house are very traditional. Number one: never touch a Hmong person on the head. Not even a child. The Hmong people believe that the soul resides on the head, so don't do that.
Well... Sounds dumb, but fine.
Yeah, and a lot of Hmong people consider looking someone in the eye to be very rude! That's why they look away when you look at them.
Yeah. Anything else?
Yeah... some Hmong people tend to smile or grin, when they're yelled at. It's a cultural thing, it expresses embarrassment or insecurity. It's not that they're laughing at you or anything.
Right, you people are nuts.
The Lutherans brought us over.
Everybody blames the Lutherans.
Grandpa Walt, you want me to help you with that, the chairs?
No, you probably just painted your nails.
The thing that haunts a guy is the stuff he wasn't ordered to do.
Your birthday today, Daisy. This year you have to make a choice between two life paths. Second chances comes your way. Extraordinary events culminate in what might seem to be an anticlimax. Your lucky numbers are 84, 23, 11, 78, and 99. What a load of shit.
That'll be 10 bucks, Walt.
Jesus, what are you, half Jew?
You know, Thao and Sue are never going to find peace in this world as long as that gang's around.
Kind of ironic, isn't it?
What is?
Thao washing your car after he tried to steal it.
And if he misses a spot, he has to do it all over again.
Now go out and talk to him, and it ain't rocket science for Christ's sake.
Yeah, but I don't have a job, a car, or a girlfriend.
Jesus. I shoulda blown his head off when I had the chance.
Yeah. Maybe so.
All right, here's the deal: you stay away from Thao, understand? You tell your friends to stay away from Thao. And if they don't listen, tell 'em you don't wanna see them anymore. That's it. Got it? I'll take that as a yes, cuz if I have to come back here, it's gonna get FUCKIN' ugly!
We shot men, stabbed them with bayonets, chopped up 17 year olds with shovels.
What would I want?
I don't know... Your wife's already gone through all of your mother's jewelry.
They were going to take me away. They're pissed because I blew my first initiation.
Yeah, you're a real pussy for wanting to hang out with that gang. What was your initiation anyway?
My Gran Torino?
What are you gonna do, Walt?
Whatever it is, they won't have a chance.
God, I am sorry for Dorothy, Walt. She was a real peach.
Thanks for coming, Al.
Come on, Zipperhead. We'll leave the mick here to play with himself.
You rotten fuck...
You rotten fuck!
*YOU ROTTEN FUCK!*
How do you want your dog? I mean... steak.
Jesus, Joseph and Mary. These Hmong broads are like badgers.
Relax, Zipperhead.
How many swamp rats can you get in one room?
Get your ofay paddy ass on down the road.
Have some respect, zipperhead. We're in mourning here.
Toad.
What are we doing?
You wanna carry your tools in a rice bag?
Way to go, old man!
Shut up, pussy. What is all this ""bro"" shit, anyway? You wanna be super-spade or something? These guys don't wanna be your ""bro"" and I don't blame 'em. Now get your ofay paddy ass on down the road.
Where's Dr. Feldman, my regular doctor?
Dr. Feldman retired three years ago, I'm his replacement, Dr. Chu.
Christ all Friday.

What's she saying?
She said welcome to her home!
No, no she's not.
Yeah, no, she didn't.
She hates me.
Yeah, she hates you.
I got blood on my hands, I'm soiled. That's why I'm going it alone tonight."
Carl Fredricksen,AM,Grumpy Old Man,"This is crazy. I finally meet my childhood hero and he's trying to kill us. What a joke.
Hey, I know a joke! A squirrel walks up to a tree and says, ""I forgot to store acorns for the winter and now I am dead."" Ha! It is funny because the squirrel gets dead.
Russell?
Dug!
I was hiding under your porch because I love you. Can I stay?
Can you stay? Why, you're my dog, aren't you? And I'm your master!
You are my master? Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
Good boy, Dug. You're a good boy.
Hey, let's play a game. It's called ""See Who Can Be Quiet the Longest"".
Cool! My mom loves that game!
Good afternoon. My name is Russell, and I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe 54, Sweatlodge 12. Are you in need of any assistance today, sir?
No.
I could help you cross the street.
No.
I could help you cross your yard.
No.
I could help you cross your... porch?
No.
Well, I gotta help you cross *something*!
This is serious. He's out to get your house!
Tell your boss he can *have* our house.
Really?
When I'm dead!
I'll take that as a maybe!
I am nobody's master, got it? I don't want you here
and I don't want you here!
I'm stuck with you, but if you two don't clear out of here by the time I count to three...
Oh! A ball! Oh, boy! Oh, boy! A ball!
Ball?
You want it, boy?
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
Huh? Huh?
Yes, I do! I so ever do want the ball!
Go get it!
Oh, boy! Oh, boy! I will go get it and then bring it back!
Russell, give me some chocolate.
I'm tired! My knee hurts!
Which knee?
...My elbow hurts!
Hi, Mr. Fredricksen! It's me, Russell!
What are you doing out here, kid?
I found the snipe and I followed it under your porch, but this snipe had a long tail and looked more like a large mouse.
Please let me in.
No.
Oh, all right. You can come...
...in.
Hey, I like dogs!
We have your dog!
Whoa.
I wonder who he belongs to?
Sit, boy.
Hey look, he's trained! Shake.
Uh-huh. Speak.
Hi there.
Did that dog just say ""Hi there""?
Oh, yes.
Whaa!
My name is Dug. I have just met you, and I love you.
Wha...
My master made me this collar. He is a good and smart master and he made me this collar so that I may speak. Squirrel!
My master is good and smart.
It's not possible!
Oh, it is because my master is smart!
Cool! What do these do, boy?
Hey would you - cuerdo con tigo - I use that collar - watashi wa hanashi ma - to talk with. I would be happy if you stop.
Russell, don't touch that. It could be... radioactive or something.
I am a great tracker. My pack sent me on a special mission, all by myself. Have you seen a bird? I am going to find one, and I am on the scent. I am a great tracker; did I mention that?
Hey, that is the bird! I have never seen one up close, but this is the bird. May I take your bird back to camp as my prisoner?
Yes, yes, take it! And on the way, learn how to bark like a real dog!
Oh, I can bark.
And this is howling.
Can we keep him? Please, please, please?
No.
But it's a TALKING DOG!
It's just a weird trick or something. Let's get to the falls.
Mr. Fredricksen? Am I supposed to dig the hole before or after?
Nyaa! None of my concern!
Oh... It's before!
Nyaa!
But I want to help!
I don't want your help, I want you safe.
A wilderness explorer is a friend to all, be a plant or fish or tiny mole!
That doesn't even rhyme!
Yeah it does.
I can't tell where we are.
Oh, we're in South America, all right. It was a cinch with my Wilderness Explorer GPS.
GP what?
My dad gave it to me; it shows exactly where we are on the planet!
With this baby, we'll never be lost!
Oops.
I found the snipe!
Oh, did you now?
Are they tall?
Oh, yes. They're very tall.
Do they have a lot of colors?
They do, indeed!
Do they like chocolate?
Ye... chocolate?
Gaah! What is that thing?
There. We should've gone enough. We should be rid of them now.
Hi, Master.
You'd better get up, Russell. Or else, the tigers will come and eat you.
There are no Tigers in South America. Zoology.
I've never been in a floating house before.
Goggles. Look at this stuff. Wow! You're going on a trip?
""Paradise Falls, a land lost in time."" You're going to South America, Mr. Fredricksen?
Don't touch that! You'll soil it.
You know, most people take a plane, but you're smart because you'll have all your TV and clocks and stuff.
Hey look, buildings! That building's so close, I can almost touch it!
Wow! This is great! You should try this, Mr. Fredricksen! Look, there's a bus stop that could take me home two blocks away! Heyy, I can see your house from here!
Don't jerk around so much, kid -
AHH!
Well, that's not gonna work.
Oh, please, oh, please, oh, please be my prisoner!
Dug, stop bothering Kevin!
That man there says I should take the bird...
... and I love that man there like he is my master.
I am not your master!
I am warning you once again, bird!
Hey! Quit it!
I am jumping on you now, bird!
Russell, at this rate we'll never get to the falls!
Here, bird!
Now, we're gonna walk to the falls quickly and quietly with no rap music or flashdancing.
Uh-huh.
We have three days, at best, before the helium leaks out of those balloons. And if we're not at the falls when that happens...
Sand.
...we're not getting to the falls.
I found sand!
Don't you worry, Ellie. We'll get our house over there.
Don't worry, I'll get you down, find a Bus Stop.
Whoa, that's s gonna be like a billion transfers to get back to my house...
Get off my roof!
Yeah! Get off of his...
Morning, gentlemen.
Good morning, Mr. Fredricksen. You ready to go?
Ready as I'll ever be. Would you do me a favor and take this?
I'll meet you at the van in just a minute. I, uh, wanna say one last goodbye to the old place.
Sure. Take all the time you need, sir.
That's typical. He's probably going to the bathroom for the 80th time.
You think he'd take better care of his house.
Ah, ha ha ha! So long, boys! I'll send you a postcard from Paradise Falls!
Hey! 'Morning, Mr. Fredricksen. Need any help there?
No. Yes. Tell your boss over there that you boys are ruining our house.
Well, just to let you know, my boss would be happy to take this old place off your hands, and for double his last offer! What do you say to that?
Uh, I take that as a no, then.
I believe I made my position to your boss quite clear.
You poured prune juice in his gas tank.
Oh, yeah, that was good.
Okay, keep her coming. Keep coming. And stop. Stop. Stop!
Why... Hey! Hey you!
What do you... What do you think you're doing?
I am so sorry, sir.
Don't touch that!
No, no, no. Let me take care of that for you.
Get away from our mailbox!
Hey. Sir, I...
I don't want you to touch it!
You gave away Kevin. You just... gave her away.
This is none of my concern.
I DIDN'T ASK FOR ANY OF THIS.
Master, it's alright.
I AM NOT YOUR MASTER! AND YOU DIDN'T SHOW UP, NONE OF THIS WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED. BAD DOG! BAD DOG! Now whether you assist me or not, I am going to Paradise Falls, if it kills me.
So you want to assist an old person?
Yep! Then I will be a Senior Wilderness Explorer!
Have you ever heard of a Snipe?
Snipe?
Bird. Beady eyes. Every night it sneaks in my yard and gobbles my poor azaleas. I'm elderly and infirm. I can't catch it. If only someone could help me...
Me! Me! I'll do it!
Oh, I don't know. It's awfully crafty. You'd have to clap your hands three times to lure it in.
I'll find it, Mr. Fredricksen!
I think its burrow is two blocks down. If you go past...
Two blocks down! Got it!
Sniiiipe! Here, Snipey, Snipey...
Bring it back here when you find it!
You in the suit! Yes, you! Take a bath, hippie!
I can smell you!
What? You can, smell us?
I can smell you!
You were talking to a rock.
Russell?
Russell, what are you doing?
I'm Gonna help Kevin, even if you won't.
Russell, No!
You've been camping before, haven't you?
Well, never outside.
Well, why didn't you ask your dad how to build a tent?
I don't think he wants to talk about this stuff.
Why don't you try him sometime? Maybe he'll surprise you.
Well, he's away a lot. I don't see him much.
He's got to be home sometime.
Well, I called, but... Phyllis told me I bug him too much.
Phyllis? You call your own mother by her first name?
Phyllis isn't my mom.
Oh.
Once you get to the Porch, find a rope, and pull me up. Got it?
Are you on the Porch yet?
I can't do it.
That's it? I came all this way just to end up on the Wrong Side of this Rock Pile?
Now what am I gonna do?
I can assist you to the Falls. We could walk you house over.
Well, that could work.
Then when we get there, will you sign my badge?"
Howard Beale,AM,Grumpy Old Man,"I don't have to tell you things are bad. Everybody knows things are bad. It's a depression. Everybody's out of work or scared of losing their job. The dollar buys a nickel's worth, banks are going bust, shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter. Punks are running wild in the street and there's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do, and there's no end to it. We know the air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat, and we sit watching our TV's while some local newscaster tells us that today we had fifteen homicides and sixty-three violent crimes, as if that's the way it's supposed to be. We know things are bad - worse than bad. They're crazy. It's like everything everywhere is going crazy, so we don't go out anymore. We sit in the house, and slowly the world we are living in is getting smaller, and all we say is, 'Please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms. Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radials and I won't say anything. Just leave us alone.' Well, I'm not gonna leave you alone. I want you to get mad! I don't want you to protest. I don't want you to riot - I don't want you to write to your congressman because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write. I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street. All I know is that first you've got to get mad. You've got to say, 'I'm a HUMAN BEING, God damn it! My life has VALUE!' So I want you to get up now. I want all of you to get up out of your chairs. I want you to get up right now and go to the window. Open it, and stick your head out, and yell, 'I'M AS MAD AS HELL, AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS ANYMORE!' I want you to get up right now, sit up, go to your windows, open them and stick your head out and yell - 'I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!' Things have got to change. But first, you've gotta get mad!... You've got to say, 'I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!' Then we'll figure out what to do about the depression and the inflation and the oil crisis. But first get up out of your chairs, open the window, stick your head out, and yell, and say it: ""I'M AS MAD AS HELL, AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS ANYMORE!""
You have meddled with the primal forces of nature, Mr. Beale, and I won't have it! Is that clear? You think you've merely stopped a business deal. That is not the case! The Arabs have taken billions of dollars out of this country, and now they must put it back! It is ebb and flow, tidal gravity! It is ecological balance! You are an old man who thinks in terms of nations and peoples. There are no nations. There are no peoples. There are no Russians. There are no Arabs. There are no third worlds. There is no West. There is only one holistic system of systems, one vast and immane, interwoven, interacting, multivariate, multinational dominion of dollars. Petro-dollars, electro-dollars, multi-dollars, reichmarks, rins, rubles, pounds, and shekels. It is the international system of currency which determines the totality of life on this planet. That is the natural order of things today. That is the atomic and subatomic and galactic structure of things today! And YOU have meddled with the primal forces of nature, and YOU... WILL... ATONE! Am I getting through to you, Mr. Beale? You get up on your little twenty-one inch screen and howl about America and democracy. There is no America. There is no democracy. There is only IBM, and ITT, and AT&T;, and DuPont, Dow, Union Carbide, and Exxon. Those are the nations of the world today. What do you think the Russians talk about in their councils of state, Karl Marx? They get out their linear programming charts, statistical decision theories, minimax solutions, and compute the price-cost probabilities of their transactions and investments, just like we do. We no longer live in a world of nations and ideologies, Mr. Beale. The world is a college of corporations, inexorably determined by the immutable bylaws of business. The world is a business, Mr. Beale. It has been since man crawled out of the slime. And our children will live, Mr. Beale, to see that... perfect world... in which there's no war or famine, oppression or brutality. One vast and ecumenical holding company, for whom all men will work to serve a common profit, in which all men will hold a share of stock. All necessities provided, all anxieties tranquilized, all boredom amused. And I have chosen you, Mr. Beale, to preach this evangel.
Why me?
Because you're on television, dummy. Sixty million people watch you every night of the week, Monday through Friday.
I have seen the face of God.
You just might be right, Mr. Beale.
But, man, you're never going to get any truth from us. We'll tell you anything you want to hear; we lie like hell. We'll tell you that, uh, Kojak always gets the killer, or that nobody ever gets cancer at Archie Bunker's house, and no matter how much trouble the hero is in, don't worry, just look at your watch; at the end of the hour he's going to win. We'll tell you any shit you want to hear. We deal in *illusions*, man! None of it is true! But you people sit there, day after day, night after night, all ages, colors, creeds... We're all you know. You're beginning to believe the illusions we're spinning here. You're beginning to think that the tube is reality, and that your own lives are unreal. You do whatever the tube tells you! You dress like the tube, you eat like the tube, you raise your children like the tube, you even *think* like the tube! This is mass madness, you maniacs! In God's name, you people are the real thing! *WE* are the illusion! So turn off your television sets. Turn them off now. Turn them off right now. Turn them off and leave them off! Turn them off right in the middle of the sentence I'm speaking to you now! TURN THEM OFF...
Good evening. Today is Wednesday, September the 24th, and this is my last broadcast. Yesterday I announced on this program that I was going to commit public suicide, admittedly an act of madness. Well, I'll tell you what happened: I just ran out of bullshit. Am I still on the air? I really don't know any other way to say it other than I just ran out of bullshit. Bullshit is all the reasons we give for living. And if we can't think up any reasons of our own, we always have the God bullshit. We don't know why we're going through all this pointless pain, humiliation, decays, so there better be someone somewhere who does know. That's the God bullshit. And then, there's the noble man bullshit; that man is a noble creature that can order his own world; who needs God? Well, if there's anybody out there that can look around this demented slaughterhouse of a world we live in and tell me that man is a noble creature, believe me: That man is full of bullshit. I don't have anything going for me. I haven't got any kids. And I was married for thirty-three years of shrill, shrieking fraud. So I don't have any bullshit left. I just ran out of it, you see.
I want you to go to the window, open it, stick your head out and yell: ""I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore.""
Right now, there is a whole, an entire generation that never knew anything that didn't come out of this tube. This tube is the gospel, the ultimate revelation; this tube can make or break presidents, popes, prime ministers; this tube is the most awesome goddamn propaganda force in the whole godless world, and woe is us if it ever falls into the hands of the wrong people, and that's why woe is us that Edward George Ruddy died. Because this company is now in the hands of CCA, the Communications Corporation of America; there's a new chairman of the board, a man called Frank Hackett, sitting in Mr. Ruddy's office on the twentieth floor. And when the 12th largest company in the world controls the most awesome goddamn propaganda force in the whole godless world, who knows what shit will be peddled for truth on this network?
This story is about Howard Beale, who was the news anchorman on UBS TV. In his time, Howard Beale had been a mandarin of television, the grand old man of news, with a HUT rating of 16 and a 28 audience share. In 1969, however, his fortunes began to decline. He fell to a 22 share. The following year, his wife died, and he was left a childless widower with an 8 rating and a 12 share. He became morose and isolated, began to drink heavily, and on September 22, 1975, he was fired, effective in two weeks. The news was broken to him by Max Schumacher, who was the president of the news division at UBS. The two old friends got properly pissed.
I was at CBS with Ed Murrow in 1951.
Must've been 1950 then.
I was at NBC, uh, associate producer. Morning News. I was just a kid. 26 years old.
Anyway... anyway... they're building the lower level of the George Washington Bridge.
We were doing a remote from there.
, :
, :
And nobody told me!
Ten after seven in the morning, I get a call, ""Where the hell are YOU? You're supposed to be on the George Washington Bridge!""
I jump out of bed, throw my raincoat over my pajamas. I run downstairs and out into the street...
...hail a cab, and I say to the cabbie, ""TAKE ME TO THE MIDDLE OF THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE!""
And the cabbie turns around and he says...
...he says ""Don't do it, buddy! You're a young man! You got your whole life ahead of you!""
, :
, :
Didn't I ever tell you that one before?
Edward George Ruddy died today! Edward George Ruddy was the Chairman of the Board of the Union Broadcasting Systems, and he died at eleven o'clock this morning of a heart condition, and woe is us! We're in a lot of trouble!
So. A rich little man with white hair died. What has that got to do with the price of rice, right? And *why* is that woe to us? Because you people, and sixty-two million other Americans, are listening to me right now. Because less than three percent of you people read books! Because less than fifteen percent of you read newspapers! Because the only truth you know is what you get over this tube. Right now, there is a whole, an entire generation that never knew anything that didn't come out of this tube! This tube is the Gospel, the ultimate revelation. This tube can make or break presidents, popes, prime ministers... This tube is the most awesome God-damned force in the whole godless world, and woe is us if it ever falls in to the hands of the wrong people, and that's why woe is us that Edward George Ruddy died. Because this company is now in the hands of CCA - the Communication Corporation of America. There's a new Chairman of the Board, a man called Frank Hackett, sitting in Mr. Ruddy's office on the twentieth floor. And when the twelfth largest company in the world controls the most awesome God-damned propoganda force in the whole godless world, who knows what shit will be peddled for truth on this network?
So, you listen to me. Listen to me: Television is not the truth! Television is a God-damned amusement park! Television is a circus, a carnival, a traveling troupe of acrobats, storytellers, dancers, singers, jugglers, side-show freaks, lion tamers, and football players. We're in the boredom-killing business! So if you want the truth... Go to God! Go to your gurus! Go to yourselves! Because that's the only place you're ever going to find any real truth.
This is not a psychotic breakdown; it's a cleansing moment of clarity.
I just ran out of bullshit.
Mr. Schumacher's right here, do you want to talk to him?
Bullshit is all the reasons we give for living. If we can't think up reasons of our own, we always have the God bullshit.
Yeah, Tom, what is it?
We don't know why we go through all this pointless pain, humiliation, and decay. So there better be someone somewhere who *does* know. That's the God bullshit.
He's saying that life is bullshit, and it is, so what are you screaming about?
What is finished... is the idea that this great country is dedicated to the freedom and flourishing of every individual in it. It's the individual that's finished. It's the single, solitary human being that's finished. It's every single one of you out there that's finished, because this is no longer a nation of independent individuals. It's a nation of some 200-odd million transistorized, deodorized, whiter-that-white, steel-belted bodies, totally unnecessary as human beings, and as replaceable as piston rods... Well, the time has come to say, is dehumanization such a bad word. Because good or bad, that's what is so. The whole world is becoming humanoid - creatures that look human but aren't. The whole world not just us. We're just the most advanced country, so we're getting there first. The whole world's people are becoming mass-produced, programmed, numbered, insensate things...
I would like at this moment to announce that I will be retiring from this program in two weeks' time because of poor ratings. Since this show is the only thing I had going for me in my life, I've decided to kill myself. I'm going to blow my brains out right on this program a week from today. So tune in next Tuesday. That should give the public relations people a week to promote the show. You ought to get a hell of a rating out of that. 50 share, easy.
Howard, I'm taking you off the air. I think you're having a breakdown, require treatment.
This is not a psychotic episode. This is a cleansing moment of clarity. I'm imbued, Max. I'm imbued with some special spirit. It's not a religious feeling at all. It's a shocking eruption of great electrical energy. I feel vivid and flashing, as if suddenly I'd been plugged into some great electromagnetic field. I feel connected to all living things. To flowers, birds, all the animals of the world. And even to some great, unseen, living force. What I think the Hindus call prana. But it's not a breakdown. I've never felt more orderly in my life. It is a shattering and beautiful sensation. It is the exalted flow of the space-time continuum, save that it is spaceless and timeless and... of such loveliness. I feel on the verge of some great, ultimate truth. And you will not take me off the air for now or for any other spaceless time!
Television is not the truth. Television is a goddamned amusement park.
Good afternoon, Mr. Beale.
I MUST MAKE MY WITNESS.
Sure thing, Mr. Beale.
All I know is, you've got to get mad. You've got to say, ""I'm a human being, goddamn it. My life has value.""
We'll tell you anything you want to hear, we lie like hell.
How are you now?
I'm as mad as a hatter.
Who isn't?
No, no. I'm gonna blow my brains out right on the air, right in the middle of the 7 O'clock news.
You'll get a hell of a rating, I'll guarantee you that. 50 share easy.
All human beings are becoming humanoids. All over the world, not just in America. We're just getting there faster since we're the most advanced country.
You're beginning to believe the illusions we're spinning here, you're beginning to believe that the tube is reality and your own lives are unreal. You do. Why, whatever the tube tells you: you dress like the tube, you eat like the tube, you raise your children like the tube, you even think like the tube. This is mass madness, you maniacs. In God's name, you people are the real thing, WE are the illusion.
...I want you to get mad. I don't want you to protest, I don't want you to riot, I don't want you to write to your congressman, because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write. I don't know what to do about the depression, the inflation, the Russians, or the crime in the streets. All I know is that first... You've got to get mad.
We could make a series of it. ""Suicide of the Week."" Aw, hell, why limit ourselves? ""Execution of the Week.""
""Terrorist of the Week.""
I love it. Suicides, assassinations, mad bombers, Mafia hitmen, automobile smash-ups: ""The Death Hour."" A great Sunday night show for the whole family. It'd wipe that fuckin' Disney right off the air."

I'm not sure, but I think were close. It's supposed to be near mile 62.
Is something wrong?
No, it's just... I met this guy, and I wonder if he's safe. Oh, you'd love him, Brenda.
What's his name? I might've already loved him.
Tom Ryan.
Yeah, did him. Big, fat Chinese guy?
No... No.
But he is the kind of guy I'd like to share the rest of my life with.
Oh, hey, I'm sorry!
Oh, it's okay. I've taken balls to the face before.
Let the game begin.
I... I don't get.
Okay... maybe this will help you ""see.""
You want me to cut something?
That should be obvious, yes.
No.
No! The key is behind your eye, okay?
I've never been a good parent. Just ask my son.
I did. What exactly is an ""cock monger""?
That's not important right now.
That last lightning bolt smelled like...
...A giant turd...
Yeah... the lightning...
Last night I saw a face.
Did it have a nose?
Well... yeah.
That does sound like a face.
I've never been a good parent. Just ask my son.
I did. What exactly is an ""Ass Clown""?
That's not important right now.
I'm not a very good father. Just ask my son.
I did. What exactly is a ""taint-licker""?
That's not important right now.
Oh, my God!
Don't mind her. She slip and fall.
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry!
It's okay. My throat cushioned the blow.
Oh, Brenda, I know you'd love him.
What's his name, I may have already loved him.
Tom Ryan.
Yep, did him. Big Chinese dude, right?
Okay Mrs. Norris, time to dig out that dootie bubble...
I was married once...
Get out the way, bitch!
Don't call me no bitch! You ain't shit!
Shut yo ass up, snow ho!
Well, actually, married twice.
It looks like we have a lot in...
...common.
We're already finishing each other's...
...dinner!
...sentences.
Pussy.
Brenda!
What? 50 Cent got shot nine times and he's still walking around!
Cindy! Oh, it's been so long.
Brenda, I thought you were dead.
Oh, I thought you were dead, too!
Turning now to sports...
and an evil video tape that kills anyone who watches it in seven days. It's true. We're all in danger. There's an alien force that's trying prevent you from knowing the truth.
Oh, no. Campbell, are you insane?
It's a horrible fate.
Carson, I have to do this.
Correction, there really is no danger. Actually, I didn't really mean anything I just said. Yes, I did. Every word of it. Everyone watching this could be dead in a week.

I been cleanin' after this dumb-ass cracker Giggins for ten years, but I been hittin' it with his woman for twelve. Know what I'm sayin', nigga? She likes her some chocolate. Sharpton for President y'all. I'm outie.
Cody, did I ever tell you what your mom said about you the day you were born?
No.
I was in the delivery room with her. She was having a hard time. Then you began to come out of her. And your mom screamed and screamed in pain. She yelled, ""Just kill me. Bludgeon me with a bedpan. Whatever you do, put me out of this pain."" She was gushing torrents of blood. I have this all on tape if you want to see it someday. Well, finally you came out. Your mom cut your umbilical cord herself. Well, on the second try. The first time she snipped your penis in half. After all, she was drunk. Actually, drugged. We'd been out the night before celebrating St. Patrick's Day. And she thought, ""Hey, I never tasted crystal meth."" So she did just a little.
My penis?
Yes. They sewed it on upside down.
So that's why I pee up?
Yes. We'll get it fixed, honey. It's on my list of things. Right after we get TiVo. Anyway, there you were. Your mom turned to me and she said, ""Hey, you want him? Take him."" And then she died. And I took you. Do you know why? I'd just lost my cat in a fire, and I needed something to pet and feed. And I miss that cat, Cody. But I love you. And nothing's ever gonna change that, not even the very painful death we're about to experience.
Hello?
It's me. How you doing?
Fine.
Enjoying your last week? I can't wait to see you. Six days now, right?
Yeah.
It was great catching up. Can I speak to Cody?
Why? He didn't watch the tape.
Yes, he did. Come on, Cindy, I do this for a living.
Hello?
Hello, I'm calling from ""Reader's Digest"" with a fantastic offer for Cody.
No, you're not! You're that evil little girl from the tape!
Okay, you got me. How about I just leave a message for him?
Fine.
Uh-huh. Yeah. Okay, how do you spell that? Right. Okay, got it. Bye-bye.
Aaaah!
Hello?
Seven days.
What? Willie Mays?
Seven days.
Who's gay? Hello?
Seven days.
What?
Can you hear me now?
Kind of.
Can you hear me now?
Yes. Perfect.
Seven days.
Seven days. Oh, my God. I'm gonna die next Monday?
Yes. No. Wait. Monday. That would be seven business days. This is seven days starting now.
So seven days to this very hour? My watch broke. How am I gonna know the exact hour?
Forget hours. This day seven days from now.
But there's a holiday coming up. Do you count the holiday?
Well, that depends. What holiday?
Martin Luther King Day.
Then no.
Why not? Everybody at work is taking it off.
Jesus Christ, lady. I'm giving you seven friggin' days. I can come over now and kill the shit out of you if you'd rather have that.
Oh my God! What happened?
I don't know... we were play this great game, then I looked down and...
Yahtzee!

It's so hard.
Well, you're a beautiful woman, and you're pressing up against me.
Something weird is going on at your farm. I know it.
I don't know what you're talking about. Sometimes a sheep just needs to be pushed through the fence.
Call it women's intuition, or ESPN, or both, but I can tell when danger's near...
Oh, come on. Cindy, the news is on! Another little white girl done fell down a well. Fifty black people got they ass beat by police today, but the whole world gotta stop for one little whitey down the hole.
Cindy, the TV's leaking. Cindy... Cindy something's wrong here.
Cindy, this bitch is messin' up my floor!
Cindy, Help me!
I'm not listening.
Get up you little ugly bitch. C'mon, let me see what you got. What you gonna do?
That's all?
Oooh, I'm whippin' her ass, Cindy! Yeah, wassup?
I saw this tape, and I think you should know about it. It had these really shocking images on it.
Brenda, it was Mardi Gras, I never drank Vodka before, and I was outta beads!
No, not that tape Cindy. Anyway, you watch the tape, and when it's over, your phone rings. And this creepy voice says, ""You're Gonna Die In Seven Days"", and seven days later...
When did you watch it?
A week ago. A week ago, tonight.
Brenda!
.
Oh my God, you bitch!
Ketchup!
Oh, you got me!
I can't believe you fell for that fake seizure!
But it seemed so real!
It did didn't it?
And you peed!
Yeah! I really sold that shit, didn't I? I just love the look on your face when you are scared, girl! You are too easy!
. I got you with the old fake hand! I'm gonna get the rest of the popcorn...
And it's been circulating and killing ever since.
Just like Pootie Tang.
It's sweeps month. Ratings mean everything. People want human interest stories, like the one you did yesterday.
The report on breast augmentation? It was just ten minutes of topless women. People want hard hitting stories, and indepth coverage, and, and...
And TWINS.
These just came today. Photos from a trip she took.
They're blank.
Turn them around, honey.
Oh.
I'm looking for something more than just good sex.
I know. You want commitment.
No, I want great sex.
Sue wanted to pay respects to her teacher. You?
Brenda was my bitch.
So can you tell me about...
The tape?
Yes. I watched it and...
The phone rang.
Right. Then this voice said...
That you would die in seven days.
Okay, that's getting...
Extremely annoying.
Yeah.
Try being married to her. I catch shit about women I ain't slept with yet.
So, I'll be doing the rap battle at the 23 Club tomorrow night.
Oh, I don't believe this shit.
Word! You two should come down! I'll be rappin', I'll be cappin', I'll be tappin', I'll be flappin', I'll be happen... ing. Ding, bing, wing. Yo!
Sounds good!
Would, could, should, 'hood.
Ugh!
Gug, mug, dug, bug.
Thank you all. Your love has freed my soul. I won't have to kill again.
Really?
I'm just screwin' with ya!
The answer is simple. You are the eventuality of an anomaly. You are inexorably seeking a sedulant probability.
Sedulant? I uh...
Grotesquery?... No?... What about, contingent affirmation?... That's gotta mean somethin...
It's already begun. You're too late.
Oh, my God.
But not too late to make an old man happy.
And now back to you, Ross.
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.
I can't believe you let that happen.
I know, I'm sorry. I screwed up.
Listen, we can still save him. The answer to the tape, to your crop circles, is at a lighthouse. Oh, you think I'm crazy, don't you?
Of course I do.
If only God had taken us instead of our daughter.
And knowing your Brenda like I did, I'd say she wishes the same thing.
And I told you, Campbell, no more paranoid on-air rants about the supernatural.
I know. This station is about sex, violence, and the weather.
Yes. That reminds me. We're gonna need that ""Porn Star Shot Dead in a Hurricane"" story.
Meanwhile, a tornado in Charleston threatens a clothing-optional beach where just yesterday a naked couple was brutally murdered. This just five miles from where the last naked couple was brutally murdered.
Why is there an open casket?
George it's a wake.
She's alive, Sue your teacher is alive!
No George she's dead!
No Brenda! Don't die on me!

Hey get away from him broad!
clear!
Time to go back down the well, bitch!"
Brandi,AB,Dumb Blonde,"Why did you stop, motherfucker?
Are you all right?
Physically yes, but psychologically? No!
It's like my mom always said: you can polish a turd, but it's still a piece of shit.
I didn't know you partied like that.
Yeah, I party like that every 4 to 6 hours."
Pola Debevoise,AB,Dumb Blonde,"I can't shack up with a dame I've never met before and she's crazy too!
You don't have to. She'll come up and you'll see if you like her. If you don't...
Is she any help to this?
Let's see
Hey Loc, how much money you got?
I got a quarter.
Great. Pick up lunch on your way over.
Ok, how many.
Three
Ok, I'll be there in 15 minutes.
Well that's a big contribution to a million dollar proposition. One whole quarter!
Maybe, but she's awfully clever with a quarter.
I wouldn't mind marrying a Vanderbilt?
Or Mr. Cadillac.
No such person. I checked.
Is there a Mr. Texaco?
I want to marry Rockefeller.
Which one?
I don't care.
Men aren't attentive to girls who wear glasses.
I'll say this for him: we haven't ordered anything yet under five dollars a portion!
If there's anything left over don't forget to tell the waiter you want to take it home for the dog.
I was nuts about him. Know what he did to me. First he gave me a phony name. Second, he was already married. Third, the minute the preacher said amen, he never did another tap of work. Then he stole my TV set and gave it to a car hop. When I asked him about that, he hit me with a chicken.
A live chicken?
No, a baked chicken; stuffed."
Romy White,"BI, BR, AB","Slacker, Valley Girl, Dumb Blonde","So, Mi-chelle! What are you up to?
Oh, okay. Um, I invented Post-Its.
No offense, Michele, but how in the world did *you* think of Post-Its?
Uh...
And I thought of them completely by myself. I mean, all Michele did was say: ""What about making them yellow?""
Actually I invented a special kind of glue.
Oh really? Well then I'm sure you wouldn't mind giving us a detailed account of exactly how you concocted this miracle glue, would you?
No. Um, well, ordinarily when you make glue first you need to thermoset your resin and then after it cools you have to mix in an epoxide, which is really just a fancy-schmancy name for any simple oxygenated adhesive, right? And then I thought maybe, just maybe, you could raise the viscosity by adding a complex glucose derivative during the emulsification process and it turns out I was right.
Swear to God, sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.
Do you want to try to have sex sometime just to see if we are?
What? Yeah, right, Michelle. Just the idea of having sex with another woman creeps me out. But if we're not married by the time we're 30, ask me again.
Okay.
Oh my God, you did it!
Yeah, I did.
What did you have to do?
I had to give everyone in the service department hand jobs.
Well, while you were doing that, I made us a tape of all the nostalgic songs from high school to get us in the mood.
Michele?
What?
Do you really think I would do that? For a car? Just get in.
O.K.
I don't believe it!
What?
THAT!
They're back!
Nice outfits. Post-it's must be really lucrative!
Romy, are you sure you wanna do this?
Oh yeah, Michele. I am SO sure!
What the hell is your problem, Christie? Why the hell are you always such a nasty bitch? I mean, okay, so Michele and I did make up some stupid lie! We only did it because we wanted you to treat us like human beings. But you know what I realized? I don't care if you like us, 'cause we don't like you. You're a bad person with an ugly heart, and we don't give a flying fuck what you think!
Come on Michele.
Okay, and... YEAH!
Unbelievable! They're as deluded about their lives as they are about those HIDEOUS clothes
Actually Christie. They have nice lines. A fun, frisky use of color. All and all, I'd have to say they're really... NOT BAD!
Well, WE still think they're ridiculous. Don't we girls?
Why don't you just let them think for themselves for once?
You're just jealous. Because unlike a certain ball-busting dried up career woman, I might mention, we're all HAPPILY MARRIED!
That's right, Christie. Keep telling yourself that.
Remember the prom? You got so thin by then.
Oh, I know. I was so lucky getting mono. That was like the best diet ever.
Heather, um, has anyone ever told you that smoking can kill you?
No. No one. Thank you.
Did you lose weight?
Actually, I have been trying this new fat free diet I invented. All I've had to eat for the past six days are gummy bears, jelly beans, and candy corns.
God, I wish I had your discipline.
Wanna get a room?
But you're married!
To Christie!
Yeah, but you have children, and you're a successful real estate developer.
I do dry wall for her old man's construction company, and you know this new kid, don't even know if he's mine! So, how about that room?
Okay. Why don't you get that room? Why don't you wash your face and take off all your clothes? And, I'll be there in five minutes.
All right! Your fantasy is going to come true tonight. See you later!
Bye.
Now he's going to see what it feels like to wait.
Such a good one.
Oh my God! Remember what a big controversy it was for us to have our picture taken together?
Yeah, because Danny Weller like, lodged that complaint. Because alphabetically he was supposed to be between us.
So we said: ""OK Danny. If you want to be between us, come to Michele's house on Friday night and we'll be waiting.""
And then he showed up, and we were like: ""Danny, it was a joke!""
And then we turned the sprinklers on him!
Oh my God!
Didn't he die?
I think so.
Aw, look, poor thing - they won't let her shop. Yeah - like those salesgirls in Beverly Hills aren't bigger whores than she is.
Hey, um, great suit. Is that an Armani?
Yes. Yes, it is.
I thought so. So, what do you do?
I'm a suit salesman.
Would you excuse me? I cut my foot before and my shoe is filling up with blood.
Do you live with Michele Weinberger?
Yeah.
I just figured she'd be married to Sandy by now.
Sandy Frink?
Yes, Sandy Frink! He could barely contain his erection every time she walked by! Why do you think he always carried around that huge notebook?
The Frink-a-zoid and Michele... I'm sure! Besides, didn't *you* have a thing for Sandy in high school?
I did not have a THING! I did not have a thing, I did NOT have a THING! I was VERY much in love with him! VERY much in love and there's a difference!
There's a difference!
There's a difference! I have to go now!
All I ever wanted was for people to think that we were better than we were in high school. And now we're just a stupid joke, just like we always were.
Romy, can I tell you the truth? I never knew that we weren't that great in high school. I mean, we always had so much fun together... I thought high school was a blast! And until you told me that our lives weren't good enough, I thought everything *since* high school was a blast. I think we should go back out there as ourselves, and just have fun like we always do. The hell with everyone else!
I don't think I can.
Well, do you think you can stop being such a baby? God! I feel like I've been, like, chasing you all over this reunion. We have come all this way, now we are going to enjoy ourselves whether you like it or not!
God, Michele... I've never seen this side of your personality before. You're so bossy and domineering. I like it!
Me too!
I'm the Mary, and you're the Rhoda.
YOU'RE the Rhoda, you're the Jewish one.
Sandy Frink has a helicopter?
Yeah, apparently he's worth millions. He invented some kind of rubber.
Like for condoms?

Cut loose! Footloose! Kick off your sunday shoes!

Cut loose! Footloose! Kick off your sunday shoes!
I have no idea what the rest of the lyrics are...
You have to say something nice about my penis!
Oh, Ramon! Your penis is so powerful! I'm coming! Okay, thanks, get off me now.
Have a ""Romy and Michele"" day!
Michelle and I have this high school reunion to go to, and we need to show up in a really cool car.
Yeah?
Todd told me he gave you a really great deal on a convertible and that you were fixing it up.
Yeah?
So... can I borrow your car?
Well, if I loan you my car, what do I get?
Uh... what do you want?
Oh, Romy... you know what I want.
Forget it! I'm not going to have sex with you just to borrow your stupid car!
I gotta get something!
OK... close the blinds, and we'll work something out.
You have absolutely no proof that you're cuter.
Oh, proof. You want proof? Ok, fine. Who lost their virginity first?
Oh, big wow, with your cousin Barry. I wouldn't brag about it.
Do you have some sort of business woman special?
Come again?
Well, were business women.
From LA.
And you know how some places have like a lunch special?
For business women...
We don't have anything like that.
Ok we'll take 2 burgers, fries, and medium cokes cause were in a hurry.
We're due in Tucson later... some business thing, you know.
What kind of business you all in?
Heather? Heather Mooney? From Sagebrush High in Tuscon?
Yeah?
It's Romy! Romy White!
You're shittin' me.
No! This is so weird - I didn't know you were living in L.A.
Well, now that you know, will we be getting together a lot?
Billy, honey. Tell your mommy that Michelle Wienberger is on the phone.
No. Not Until you admit that I'm the Mary, and you're the Rhoda.
I'm the Mary! You're a pasty hag on your death bed!
Thanks a lot Romy.
What?
Thanks for stealing my boyfriend!
What are you talking about?
Billy just broke up with me. Apparently he's had a crush on you since Mr. Roswell's class and now that he knows that you like him, he doesn't want to pretend with me anymore. My life was perfect and you ruined it! Oh!
I swear to God Christy, I didn't even think he'd dance with me!
Wow, she is really P.O.'d. This is so cool!
I know. It's like I had this dream where Billy was like in love with me, and he was in a wheelchair, but still, it's like it's coming true!
Well, anyways, are you going?
I'd rather put this out in my ass!
I've been killing myself for eight days and I gained a pound.
That's impossible. Did you deduct sixteen pounds for your shoes?
Isn't it weird when you're not friends with your friends anymore? I mean, Michele and I just fell out of touch about two hours ago.
The reunion is less than two weeks away. I just can't believe that you turned down a job!
Well, I thought the whole point of going to the reunion was to impress people. I mean, how am I gonna impress ANYBODY by selling ban-lon smocks at Bargain Mart?
Well we definitely weren't in the A group, but you know, we weren't really in the B group either.
Oh my god! We weren't in the C group were we?
Oh god no, that was, like, all the losers and honor students, like Sandy Frink and Heather Mooney.
So, Romy, what group WERE we in?
Well, we weren't really in a group, we were more like loners. Oh look! There we are!
Yeah, and alone.
Just a reminder, girls - you have DETENTION after school today.
Yeah, we're really looking forward to it!
Can you believe he just got married? Like how desperate is she?
Hey, if anyone needs to make a call, I've got a phone!
Michele? Now that I'm looking at this, our lives don't seem as impressive as I thought.
They don't?
Well, do you think it's impressive that we're still single, and we've been living together for ten years, and I'm a cashier and you're unemployed?
Not super-impressive.
Then, what's the point of going if we're not going to impress people?
Chubbo?
The name is Romy.
Yeah, Ramon. That'll happen.
Hi, my name's Romy and I'm an alcoholic.
Hi Romy.
Hey.
So, Mi-chelle! What are you up to?
Oh, okay. Um, I invented Post-Its.
No offense, Michele, but how in the world did *you* think of Post-Its?
Uh...

Isn't it weird when you're not friends with your friends anymore? I mean, Michele and I just fell out of touch about two hours ago.
The reunion is less than two weeks away. I just can't believe that you turned down a job!
Well, I thought the whole point of going to the reunion was to impress people. I mean, how am I gonna impress ANYBODY by selling ban-lon smocks at Bargain Mart?
Well we definitely weren't in the A group, but you know, we weren't really in the B group either.
Oh my god! We weren't in the C group were we?
Oh god no, that was, like, all the losers and honor students, like Sandy Frink and Heather Mooney.
So, Romy, what group WERE we in?
Well, we weren't really in a group, we were more like loners. Oh look! There we are!
Yeah, and alone.
Just a reminder, girls - you have DETENTION after school today.
Yeah, we're really looking forward to it!
Can you believe he just got married? Like how desperate is she?
Hey, if anyone needs to make a call, I've got a phone!
Michele? Now that I'm looking at this, our lives don't seem as impressive as I thought.
They don't?
Well, do you think it's impressive that we're still single, and we've been living together for ten years, and I'm a cashier and you're unemployed?
Not super-impressive.
Then, what's the point of going if we're not going to impress people?
Chubbo?
The name is Romy.
Yeah, Ramon. That'll happen.
Hi, my name's Romy and I'm an alcoholic.
Hi Romy.
Hey.
So, Mi-chelle! What are you up to?
Oh, okay. Um, I invented Post-Its.
No offense, Michele, but how in the world did *you* think of Post-Its?
Uh...
And I thought of them completely by myself. I mean, all Michele did was say: ""What about making them yellow?""
Actually I invented a special kind of glue.
Oh really? Well then I'm sure you wouldn't mind giving us a detailed account of exactly how you concocted this miracle glue, would you?
No. Um, well, ordinarily when you make glue first you need to thermoset your resin and then after it cools you have to mix in an epoxide, which is really just a fancy-schmancy name for any simple oxygenated adhesive, right? And then I thought maybe, just maybe, you could raise the viscosity by adding a complex glucose derivative during the emulsification process and it turns out I was right.
Swear to God, sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.
Do you want to try to have sex sometime just to see if we are?
What? Yeah, right, Michelle. Just the idea of having sex with another woman creeps me out. But if we're not married by the time we're 30, ask me again.
Okay.
Oh my God, you did it!
Yeah, I did.
What did you have to do?
I had to give everyone in the service department hand jobs.
Well, while you were doing that, I made us a tape of all the nostalgic songs from high school to get us in the mood.
Michele?
What?
Do you really think I would do that? For a car? Just get in.
O.K.
I don't believe it!
What?
THAT!
They're back!
Nice outfits. Post-it's must be really lucrative!
Romy, are you sure you wanna do this?
Oh yeah, Michele. I am SO sure!
What the hell is your problem, Christie? Why the hell are you always such a nasty bitch? I mean, okay, so Michele and I did make up some stupid lie! We only did it because we wanted you to treat us like human beings. But you know what I realized? I don't care if you like us, 'cause we don't like you. You're a bad person with an ugly heart, and we don't give a flying fuck what you think!
Come on Michele.
Okay, and... YEAH!
Unbelievable! They're as deluded about their lives as they are about those HIDEOUS clothes
Actually Christie. They have nice lines. A fun, frisky use of color. All and all, I'd have to say they're really... NOT BAD!
Well, WE still think they're ridiculous. Don't we girls?
Why don't you just let them think for themselves for once?
You're just jealous. Because unlike a certain ball-busting dried up career woman, I might mention, we're all HAPPILY MARRIED!
That's right, Christie. Keep telling yourself that.
Remember the prom? You got so thin by then.
Oh, I know. I was so lucky getting mono. That was like the best diet ever.
Heather, um, has anyone ever told you that smoking can kill you?
No. No one. Thank you.
Did you lose weight?
Actually, I have been trying this new fat free diet I invented. All I've had to eat for the past six days are gummy bears, jelly beans, and candy corns.
God, I wish I had your discipline.
Wanna get a room?
But you're married!
To Christie!
Yeah, but you have children, and you're a successful real estate developer.
I do dry wall for her old man's construction company, and you know this new kid, don't even know if he's mine! So, how about that room?
Okay. Why don't you get that room? Why don't you wash your face and take off all your clothes? And, I'll be there in five minutes.
All right! Your fantasy is going to come true tonight. See you later!
Bye.
Now he's going to see what it feels like to wait.
Such a good one.
Oh my God! Remember what a big controversy it was for us to have our picture taken together?
Yeah, because Danny Weller like, lodged that complaint. Because alphabetically he was supposed to be between us.
So we said: ""OK Danny. If you want to be between us, come to Michele's house on Friday night and we'll be waiting.""
And then he showed up, and we were like: ""Danny, it was a joke!""
And then we turned the sprinklers on him!
Oh my God!
Didn't he die?
I think so.
Aw, look, poor thing - they won't let her shop. Yeah - like those salesgirls in Beverly Hills aren't bigger whores than she is.
Hey, um, great suit. Is that an Armani?
Yes. Yes, it is.
I thought so. So, what do you do?
I'm a suit salesman.
Would you excuse me? I cut my foot before and my shoe is filling up with blood.
Do you live with Michele Weinberger?
Yeah.
I just figured she'd be married to Sandy by now.
Sandy Frink?
Yes, Sandy Frink! He could barely contain his erection every time she walked by! Why do you think he always carried around that huge notebook?
The Frink-a-zoid and Michele... I'm sure! Besides, didn't *you* have a thing for Sandy in high school?
I did not have a THING! I did not have a thing, I did NOT have a THING! I was VERY much in love with him! VERY much in love and there's a difference!
There's a difference!
There's a difference! I have to go now!
All I ever wanted was for people to think that we were better than we were in high school. And now we're just a stupid joke, just like we always were.
Romy, can I tell you the truth? I never knew that we weren't that great in high school. I mean, we always had so much fun together... I thought high school was a blast! And until you told me that our lives weren't good enough, I thought everything *since* high school was a blast. I think we should go back out there as ourselves, and just have fun like we always do. The hell with everyone else!
I don't think I can.
Well, do you think you can stop being such a baby? God! I feel like I've been, like, chasing you all over this reunion. We have come all this way, now we are going to enjoy ourselves whether you like it or not!
God, Michele... I've never seen this side of your personality before. You're so bossy and domineering. I like it!
Me too!
I'm the Mary, and you're the Rhoda.
YOU'RE the Rhoda, you're the Jewish one.
Sandy Frink has a helicopter?
Yeah, apparently he's worth millions. He invented some kind of rubber.
Like for condoms?

I have no idea what the rest of the lyrics are...
You have to say something nice about my penis!
Oh, Ramon! Your penis is so powerful! I'm coming! Okay, thanks, get off me now.
Have a ""Romy and Michele"" day!
Michelle and I have this high school reunion to go to, and we need to show up in a really cool car.
Yeah?
Todd told me he gave you a really great deal on a convertible and that you were fixing it up.
Yeah?
So... can I borrow your car?
Well, if I loan you my car, what do I get?
Uh... what do you want?
Oh, Romy... you know what I want.
Forget it! I'm not going to have sex with you just to borrow your stupid car!
I gotta get something!
OK... close the blinds, and we'll work something out.
You have absolutely no proof that you're cuter.
Oh, proof. You want proof? Ok, fine. Who lost their virginity first?
Oh, big wow, with your cousin Barry. I wouldn't brag about it.
Do you have some sort of business woman special?
Come again?
Well, were business women.
From LA.
And you know how some places have like a lunch special?
For business women...
We don't have anything like that.
Ok we'll take 2 burgers, fries, and medium cokes cause were in a hurry.
We're due in Tucson later... some business thing, you know.
What kind of business you all in?
Heather? Heather Mooney? From Sagebrush High in Tuscon?
Yeah?
It's Romy! Romy White!
You're shittin' me.
No! This is so weird - I didn't know you were living in L.A.
Well, now that you know, will we be getting together a lot?
Billy, honey. Tell your mommy that Michelle Wienberger is on the phone.
No. Not Until you admit that I'm the Mary, and you're the Rhoda.
I'm the Mary! You're a pasty hag on your death bed!
Thanks a lot Romy.
What?
Thanks for stealing my boyfriend!
What are you talking about?
Billy just broke up with me. Apparently he's had a crush on you since Mr. Roswell's class and now that he knows that you like him, he doesn't want to pretend with me anymore. My life was perfect and you ruined it! Oh!
I swear to God Christy, I didn't even think he'd dance with me!
Wow, she is really P.O.'d. This is so cool!
I know. It's like I had this dream where Billy was like in love with me, and he was in a wheelchair, but still, it's like it's coming true!
Well, anyways, are you going?
I'd rather put this out in my ass!
I've been killing myself for eight days and I gained a pound.
That's impossible. Did you deduct sixteen pounds for your shoes?

Do you have some sort of business woman special?
Come again?
Well, were business women.
From LA.
And you know how some places have like a lunch special?
For business women...
We don't have anything like that.
Ok we'll take 2 burgers, fries, and medium cokes cause were in a hurry.
We're due in Tucson later... some business thing, you know.
What kind of business you all in?
Billy, honey. Tell your mommy that Michelle Wienberger is on the phone.
No. Not Until you admit that I'm the Mary, and you're the Rhoda.
I'm the Mary! You're a pasty hag on your death bed!
Thanks a lot Romy.
What?
Thanks for stealing my boyfriend!
What are you talking about?
Billy just broke up with me. Apparently he's had a crush on you since Mr. Roswell's class and now that he knows that you like him, he doesn't want to pretend with me anymore. My life was perfect and you ruined it! Oh!
I swear to God Christy, I didn't even think he'd dance with me!
Wow, she is really P.O.'d. This is so cool!
I know. It's like I had this dream where Billy was like in love with me, and he was in a wheelchair, but still, it's like it's coming true!
I've been killing myself for eight days and I gained a pound.
That's impossible. Did you deduct sixteen pounds for your shoes?
Ow! That hurt! But it looked really good!
The reunion is less than two weeks away. I just can't believe that you turned down a job!
Well, I thought the whole point of going to the reunion was to impress people. I mean, how am I gonna impress ANYBODY by selling ban-lon smocks at Bargain Mart?
Well we definitely weren't in the A group, but you know, we weren't really in the B group either.
Oh my god! We weren't in the C group were we?
Oh god no, that was, like, all the losers and honor students, like Sandy Frink and Heather Mooney.
So, Romy, what group WERE we in?
Well, we weren't really in a group, we were more like loners. Oh look! There we are!
Yeah, and alone.
Just a reminder, girls - you have DETENTION after school today.
Yeah, we're really looking forward to it!
Can you believe he just got married? Like how desperate is she?
Like that one chip is gonna make a difference... wasn't even a whole chip.
You also get a 5% employee discount over and above our everyday low prices.
I got this tie for a dollar.
You paid a whole dollar for that?
Michele? Now that I'm looking at this, our lives don't seem as impressive as I thought.
They don't?
Well, do you think it's impressive that we're still single, and we've been living together for ten years, and I'm a cashier and you're unemployed?
Not super-impressive.
Then, what's the point of going if we're not going to impress people?
You paid a whole dollar for that?
I'd like to go... away!
You also get a 5% employee discount, over and above our everyday low prices.
I got this tie for a dollar.
You paid a whole dollar for that?"
Suzanne Stone Maretto,AB,Dumb Blonde,"He says that he needs to see you and that he's dying of love.
Ughhh! Tell him to call a doctor.
And Russell wants his money, and his CDs.
Really? Well, you tell Russell if he doesn't keep his mouth shut, he's gonna be playing his goddamn CDs in the gas chamber!
You know Mr. Gorbachev, the guy that ran Russia for so long? I am a firm believer that he would still be in power today if he had had that ugly purple thing taken off his head.
Well, you grow up, you know? You think it's all gonna be like a fairytale. Like you're Sleeping Beauty, and along comes this Prince Charming, and he looks at you, and it's night time, and he smiles at you and kisses you.
Yeah, I - I know that story.
And then... then you wake up... and it's daylight... and you look at him. It's just when you work all day, trying to perfect yourself and create something meaningful, you expect some support. Does anyone ever say ""Did you have a good shoot today?"" or ""How's the editing going?"" or *anything* of that nature?
I guess not.
No. I mean, the point is... Larry is a nice guy, you know? But he just doesn't know a thing about television.
It's their word against mine. Who are they? Bunch of 16-year-old losers who grew up in trailers whose parents sit around drinking and screwing their cousins!
I'm a professional person, for Christ's sake. I come from a good home. Who do you think a jury would believe?
Good Evening, from the WWEN Weather Center!
Weather Center?
You're not anybody in America unless you're on TV. On TV is where we learn about who we really are. Because what's the point of doing anything worthwhile if nobody's watching? And if people are watching, it makes you a better person.
It's nice to live in a country where life, liberty... and all the rest of it still stand for something.
I think if you wanted a babysitter, you should marry Mary Poppins
You aren't really anybody in America if you're not on TV."
Rocky Horror - A Creation,AB,Dumb Blonde,"I have never been a quitter. To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body. But as president, I must put the interests of America first. America needs a full time president, and a full time Congress..."
Mia,"F, AB","Brainless Beauty, Dumb Blonde","Man, this whole town is dead.
Oh my God. Maybe this is like ""The Sixth Sense"" and we're the ones who are really dead.
You know what, Mia? I've been holding something back all night, so I'm gonna go ahead and say it now: That doesn't make any sense, you stupid bitch.
Okay, you guys, be totally honest. Does my vagina make me look fat?
Sounds like Sammy Boy finally got his raw meat.
I don't see how this is going to help, but all right
Oh, not me. Okay.
That doll mimed a blowjob and started smacking his ass. That's so weird.
No no no no. That's not weird at all. It's you know, it's a MILF driving a car with a doll that's miming a blowjob and spanking his ass. Yeah yeah.
Sound perfectly normal.
My brother said I used to give his GI Joe doll a boner.
Okay, you probably want to keep that to yourself.
Man, this whole town is dead.

Now look, Miss Lamont, Don and I...
Don? Don't you *dare* call him Don! I was calling him Don before you were born! I mean... You-you were kissing him!
*I* was kissing *her*! I happen to be in love with her.
That's ridiculous. Everybody knows you're in love with me.
After all, I'm still more important to the studio than she is.
Lina, I wouldn't do that to her in a million years. Why, you'd be taking her career away from her. People just don't do things like that.

That's not all I'm gonna do if I ever get my hands on her.
I never heard of anything so low. Why did you do it?
Because you liked her. I could tell.
So that's it. Believe me, I don't like her half as much as I hate you, you reptile.
Sticks and stones may break my bones...
I'd like to break every bone in your body.
You and who else, you big lummox?
What do they think I am? Dumb or something? Why, I make more money than - than - than Calvin Coolidge! Put together!

Harlan Ogilvy,U,Crazy Survivalist,"I'm dead set on living.
""Dead set on living"".
They've been planning this for a million years. We're beat to shit.
Please... my daughter.
Think about it. They defeated the greatest power in the world in a couple days. Walked right over us. And these were only the first. They'll keep coming. This is not a war any more than there's a war between men and maggots... This is an extermination.
Who knows? Maybe you will survive... Maybe they'll take you as a pet or something. Teach ya how to do tricks.
Not my blood!
Here?
Peach Schnapps. Disgusting I know it, found a whole case of this shit.
Rachel, I want you to know, that if anything happens to your daddy; I'll take care of you.
You and me? I don't think we're on the same page."
Eli,U,Crazy Survivalist,"Dear Lord, thank you for giving me the strength and the conviction to complete the task you entrusted to me. Thank you for guiding me straight and true through the many obstacles in my path. And for keeping me resolute when all around seemed lost. Thank you for your protection and your many signs along the way. Thank you for any good that I may have done, I'm so sorry about the bad. Thank you for the friend I made. Please watch over her as you watched over me. Thank you for finally allowing me to rest. I'm so very tired, but I go now to my rest at peace. Knowing that I have done right with my time on this earth. I fought the good fight, I finished the race, I kept the faith.
You know, you say you've been walking for thirty years, right?
Right?
Have you ever thought that maybe you were lost?
Nope.
Well, how do you know that you're walking in the right direction?
I walk by faith, not by sight.
What does that mean?
It means that you know something even if you don't know something.
That doesn't make any sense.
It doesn't have to make sense. It's faith, it's faith. It's the flower of light in the field of darkness that's giving me the strength to carry on. You understand?
Is that from your book?
No, it's, uh, Johnny Cash, Live at Folsom Prison.
Cursed be the ground for our sake. Both thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for us. For out of the ground we were taken, for the dust we are... and to the dust we shall return
People had more than they needed. We had no idea what was precious and what wasn't. We threw away things people kill each other for now.
I didn't think you'd ever give up the book, I thought it was too important to you
It was, I was carrying and reading it everyday, got so caught up in protecting it, I forgot to live by what I'd learnt from it
And what's that?
To do more for others than you do for yourself
The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He makes me to lie down in green pastures: he leads me beside the still waters.He restores my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil for thou art with me
That's beautiful, did you write that?
Yes, I did.
No, no. No. No, that was around a long time before you and I got here, that's for sure.
I want to come with you.
No, you don't.
I hate it here.
Then change it.
Write everything exactly as I say it. The first book of Moses, called Genesis. Chapter 1, verse 1. In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
Verse 2. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
Verse 3. And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
We gotta go now.
They killed all these people.
Not just killed them, they ate them.
Her hands, her hands were shaking.
Too much human meat. Let's go.
What ya got there in that pack?
What pack?
He got a gun.
Shit, it ain't loaded. Oh, they never are. Ain't that right, old man? Open the pack and tip it out on the road nice and slow.
Can't do that.
Take off the fucking pack. And put it on the ground. Or DIE!
Ooooh.
Are you listening to me?
I am now.
Good.
You listening to me?
Yeah.
Good. Put that hand on me again, you won't get it back.
Do you believe this fucking guy? All right, you want to do it the hard way.
How'd you do that? He just cut my hand off! What are you standing around for? Kiss him!
What'd he say?
He's in shock. I think he meant, ""Kill him.""
Thank you lord for a warm bed to sleep on, thank you for the food we are about to eat, thank you for a roof over our heads on cold nights such as this, thank you for companionship in hard times like these, Amen.
There's a whole series of beautiful Mozart and Wagner records, in still very pristine condition. But, never a Bible. Until now. May I ask what condition it's in?
It's beat up. But it will do the job.
What was it like before?
People had more than they needed, people didn't know what was precious and what wasn't, people threw away things they kill each other for now.
That was my cat.
Fine specimen.
I saw you knock him off the bar.
No. I kind of shooed him. I didn't really knock him...
You raised your hand at him.
Won't happen again, I promise you.
Hey, Martz, how about another drink?
That cat's been coming here for two years. Its got more right to be here than you.
I don't want any trouble.
Well that's too bad. Cuz you got...
""I know who you are. Murderer of innocent travelers on the road. You're gonna be held to account for the things you've done, do you know that? Do you?
Do you really read the same book everyday?
Without fail.
In all these years I've been carrying it and reading it every day, I got so caught up in keeping it safe that I forgot to live by what I learned from it.
They say the war tore a hole in the sky, you've probably heard the stories.
Yeah.
The war tore a hole in the sky, the sun came down, burnt everything, everyone, I wandered, I didn't really know what I should do or where I was going. I was just moving from place to place, trying to stay alive. And then one day I heard this voice. I don't know how to explain it, it's like it was coming from inside me. But I could hear it clear as day. Clear as I can hear you talking to me now. It told me to carry the book west, it told me that a path would be laid out before me, that I'd be led to a place where the book would be safe. It told me I'd be protected, against anyone or anything that tried to stand in my way. If only I would have faith. That was thirty years ago and I've been walking ever since.
And you did all this because a voice told you to?
I know what I hear, I know what I heard, I know I'm not crazy, I didn't imagine it
Stay on the path. It's not your concern. Stay on the path. It's not your concern.
I need that book, I want that book, I want you to stay but if you make me have to choose I'll kill you and take that book
Why, why do you want it?
I grew up with that book, I know its power.
You know that voice you heard, did it say anything about this?
We'll get out. Both of us.
What about us?
Didn't say anything about you.
Did you get blinded by the war or the sun after?
I was like this since birth, I was lucky, I was already used to living like this
I like the perfume
Its just shampoo but thank you
And who are you?
Nobody.
Oh, I doubt that. The men you killed in my bar, now they were nobody.
Can I come in?
Give me a minute.
Someone already came with food and water. I got everything I need.
Are you sure about that? It's really bright in here. I'm Solara.
Right. You filled my canteen downstairs.
Yeah. You're the walker, right?
Right.
If - if you're worried about paying, it's on the house.
Look. Paying for what?
Why don't you take a seat?
No.
No, I can't go. I can't. If I do, he'll hurt my mom.
Who?
Carnegie.
He's your father?
No, no, but we belong to him just the same. Look, I'll sleep on the floor. Tomorrow you can tell him you had a good time. I promise you, I will be no trouble. Please.
Please, don't hurt me. Here, take anything you want. You want some food? Take it.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Yeah? That's what the last guy said. Could... could you help me? The wheel came off. I can't fix it. Maybe if I... if I could... but I can't.
You know the only good thing about no soap... is that you can smell hijackers a mile off!
Could you get us some writing paper, please.
A lot of it. A whole lot of it.
Where are you going?
West
Can I come with you?
No
You can wait over there, across the street at the Orpheum.
No, I'll wait here.
Bar is about ready to open.
I'll wait here.
You don't trust me, do you?
Uh... I'll wait here.
Ask and you shall receive. God is good, is he not?
All the time.
Not all the time.
You are such a liar!
I'm not a liar.
You said I could come with you if I took you to the water.
I didn't say that, you said that, the road's no place for someone like you, trust me, you're safter there than you think.
Hey.
Yeah?
Fuck you!"

No respect.
Can I kill her now?
Wow. This guy's insane.
Well, he thought he was the subject of a secret government mind control project.
This'll take a minute.
Sure.
As it turns out... he really was being given daily doses of LSD for 11 years.
Well, in that case, he looks great.
Fantastic.
Yeah...
Do you know what's wrong with this country?
They're all trying to kill us?
Exactly!
Feel better now?
Yeah. Wanna get pancakes?
I remember the Secret Service being tougher.
Me, too.
Where'd you get this?
Home Depot.
How much?
Ten bucks.
Why are you trying to kill me?
I'm not trying to kill you!
Oh, yeah. You are.
Why would I be trying to kill you?
Because the last time we met, I tried to kill you.
That was a long time ago.
Some people hold on to things like that.
I told you something bad was gonna happen.
Keep your dress on!
Moldova sucks.
Moldova sucks!
Next time, your girlfriend can wear the dress.
Are you gonna let me talk to them? I can negotiate something.
Thanks, when we want your help, we'll get out the drain cleaner.
Listen, Plastic Man, those bastards out there probably have orders to kill me, too.
I hope so.
Why? 'Cause I'm the bad guy? I'm scum?
Can I just shoot him now?
No. You don't have people killed. I have people killed, I'm the bad guy. Remember?
Not worth a bullet.
You want nuts? Nipples?
Potty trainer?
People get shot all the time.
No, they don't. They get... paper cuts.
I mostly get shot.
Frank, we gotta get rid of this broad. I know a great place, just up the road. Lots of alligators.
We're not getting rid of the broad. I like her. Okay?
Well, wait? What's the angle?
No angle. I like her.
Ok. So... they pull her voice from the pay phone, probably right now, install the recognition software and backtrace it to Singer. So, then we show up, they bring out the satellite, and we're fried with Y-rays.
What are you doing?
Old man, my ass.
Frank, how many times have I told you? You cannot trust the system! I told you when you're in the system, they switch the flip and you're done. Man, satellites, cell phones, chips, net, the web, the dentist."
Paul Blart,AU,Loser Protagonist,"What are you trained to do? Nothing...
Okay, next question. ""Tell me about yourself.""
Let's see. I know a lot about sharks.
Let me stop you right there.
This lemonade is insane!
That's because it's a Margarita, Paul.
No one wins with a headbutt.
Yeah... I don't drink.
When are you gonna give up, Blart?
How about now? I'll meet you on the corner of ""NE"" and ""VER""!
Scuba-dooby-doo!
If you remember one thing from today, it's this: the mind is the only weapon that doesn't need a holster.

Yes, but they were dead!
All of them?
Yeah, it was kind of shocking actually! Were they dead when you send them?
No no, who sends people dead fish?
The Mafia?
You thought Brad Pitt was a cave in Yorkshire.
This is Clayton Harding, editor of Sharps Magazine.
Lord Vader.
I saw you at my party - just before you ruined it with your pig stunt.
You liked that, did you?
Sure. I especially liked the part where Clint Eastwood beat the shit out of you.
What's the greatest film ever made?
It's hard to say. I mean, I personally love La Dolce Vita...
Incorrect!
Con Air.
I beg your pardon?
Con Air, right? It's got everything, hasn't it? You know, you've got Malkovich for your acting chops, you got Nicky Cage for your action, Steve Buscemi for your comedy, John Cusack for the gays. Right? It's like a smorgasbord, isn't it?
When I was a kid, I used to think there was a special place where all the movie stars lived. A kind of ""Shangri La"". And if you could just get inside there, you'd be happy. Forever.
Hollywood? Sodom and Gomorrah. Now everybody a celebrity. You take out your breasts, you're celebrity.
I think it probably depends on the breasts...
In Poland, someone was famous because they done something. Marie Curie, Pope John Paul...
Yeah, well, they don't make entertainers like that anymore, do they?
Wise guy.
You think you've arrived, don't you? Hate to break it to you, but you're only in the first room. In about a year, maybe longer, you'll discover a secret doorway at the back of the first room that leads to the second. And in time, if you're lucky, you'll discover another doorway in the back of the second room that leads to the third. There are seven rooms altogether. You're in the first. I'm in the seventh. Don't you forget it.
Can I use the bathroom in the seventh? Because the one in the first really smells.
Which leads me to the subject of your sense of humor. I had a look through your magazine here.
What did you think?
Felt it was kind of snarky... and bitter... and witless.
I don't know the meaning of the word fear.
I'm sure there are many words you don't know the meaning of.
Look at that. All night long, people have been treating us like royalty. In London, the journalist's motto is, ""Everybody hates us, and we don't care."""
Dennis,AU,Loser Protagonist,"Excuse me, can I just stop you there.
Yes...?
Oh, I don't have anything to say... I just wanted to stop you there.
You know, I mean, I didn't do you any favours on that day, ok? I did a stupid, stupid thing. But it was only because I thought spoiling your day was better than ruining your life. Does that make any sense?
As you get older, you're gonna realize there are a lot of things that you don't like. Things much worse than this. And when those things happen, you can't just run away.
why not?
Because it doesn't solve the problem. The problem's still there. You've got to stick at it, and then figure out a way to solve the problem, even if it's really really hard.
Is that what you do, Dad?

Dad?
Hey I've got you those tickets you wanted...
They were for yesterday!
Oh so NOW you don't want them?
Why would I want them?
You could... sell them on e-bay.
Who would buy tickets for an event which happened yesterday?
...Time Travellers.
Go on then, run!
Isn't there some kind of like... special technique?
Well... yeah... you put one leg in front of the other over and over again really really fast.
We should set the alarm for about 7 o'clock.
I don't have an alarm clock.
Why not?
I never need to be anywhere.
I saw your friend Gordon this morning
I'll replace anything he stole.
What are you doing here?
I'm the assistant coach.
How'd you get to be assistant coach?
Because I have the spatula!
I thought it would be a good chance for me to get to know Whit a little better, so...
Well, maybe we should all go out to dinner then?
Really?
Yeah, and then we could go dancing...
You're joking...?
No, not at all. And afterwards we could come back here and have a threesome.
You *are* joking.
Of course, I am!
I've got a surprise for you!
Oh!... it's not a spatula is it?
Mr Doyle, how do you feel?
How the fuck do you think I feel?
I would settle for something shaped like a fish.
Go to a fishmonger!
I'm a vegetarian.
Isn't it enough?
What?
You got the girl, all right? Isn't it enough?
I just think it's high time you realized that it's over, sir! Otherwise, it's gonna be very tough for you when we move to Chicago!
What?
You'd better slow down there, chief! You've got a long way to go!
Yeah, well - so have you!
Oh, yeah! Yes, I like it! Run, fatboy, run!
I can lose weight... but you'll always be an arsehole!
Peter Perfect's perfect palace.
Try saying that when you're smashed.
I will.
I know doing this thing isn't going to change anything or make anything better but um. I would just settle for your respect. I'd settle for you smiling about the time we had together and not think it was a waste of time.
I mean, you can see my point can't you?
Yes, yes I can.
Hey, maybe there's a little man in there who looks just like you but he's really good at running.
What are you talking about?
Just a thought.
You want your son to love you? Don't break the law!
Hey! That's entrapment!
And that's brutality!
I actually ran the London Marathon
Oh that's a coincidence.
Why's that?
Oh, I watched it on the tele... well... the last hour... I sleep in on Sundays.
You can't even finish your sentence!
Oh... don't... don't... don't be... what's the word?
Prick.
I went for a bit of a run this morning and I think I've got a bit of a... rash...
Yes...
Y'know... Down in the...
Yes, yes, I understand.
Scrotal Zone."
Mark Bellison,AU,Loser Protagonist,"I was just masturbating.
That makes me think of your vagina.
If you could make the world the way you wanted it to be, what would you do? If you could change anything, if you could do anything, what's the first thing you'd do?
If I could do anything?
Anything at all?
Anything at all.
I would touch girls' boobs.
Yes.
And maybe have sex with them too.
Oh agreed, that too.
Okay, let's try that.
Where you going?
Out.
Don't look at me, I'm not attracted to you.
No listen...
Don't bother, I've heard it all before.
The world's gonna end unless we have sex right now!
Do we have time to get to a motel, or do we need to do it right here?
Motel.
Help me get me dress off.
No no, wait wait, let's get to know each-other first.
No, we have to have sex! The world is going to end!
But I don't even know your name.
Think of the children! Think of the little babies!
Let's have a drink. You look like a... ten dollars for beer? That is...
Don't you understand? We are all going to die!
Hi, this is Mark.
Oh, hi Mark. Didn't you get my email?
The one about being not good enough for you?
That's the one.
Yeah, got that. Cheers.
I did a bad thing...
It's okay, you get three!
This is the most amazing night of my entire life.
Think how amazing if you didn't smell of vomit.
I've finally decided what I want!
And what is that?
I want short fat kids with snub noses!
I'm your man.
I'm so scared, Mark. People don't talk about it, but death is a horrible thing. One minute, you're alive, and then just like that, it's all gone. This is it, Mark. Few more hours like this and then an eternity of nothingness. I'm so... I'm so frightened.
Oh, Mum. Mum, listen to me. Listen carefully. You're wrong about what happens after you die. It's not an eternity of nothingness.
Huh?
You go to your favourite place in the whole world. Yeah. And everyone you've ever loved and who's ever loved you will be there. And you'll be young again. You'll run and jump like you used to and dance. You used to dance. There's no pain. Just love. Happiness. And everyone gets a mansion. And it lasts for an eternity. An eternity, Mum. Say hello to Dad for me. Tell him I love him.
Shelley thinks you're an overweight homosexual.
I didn't say that!
Oh.
No, I said you were a fat faggot.
I stand corrected.
To think I was upset by ""overweight homosexual"".
A fatty fat faggy fag...
Oh, well. It doesn't matter. Because either way you're a dumpy little queer."
Dewey Finn,"AU, BI","Loser Protagonist, Slacker","I have been touched by your kids... and I'm pretty sure that I've touched them.
Now, what makes you mad more than anything in the world?
Billy?
You.
Billy, we've already told me off. Let's move on.
You're tacky and I hate you!
Okay, you see me after class!
I pledge allegiance... to the band... of Mr. Schneebly... and will not fight him... for creative control... and will defer to him on all issues related to the musical direction of the band.
Yes! But, you can't just say it, man. You've gotta feel it in your blood and guts! If you wanna rock, you gotta break the rules. You gotta get mad at the man! And right now, I'm the man. That's right, I'm the man, and who's got the guts to tell me off? Huh? Who's gonna tell me off?
Shut the hell up, Schneebly!
That's it Freddy, that's it! Who can top him?
Get outta here, stupidass.
Yes, Alicia!
You're a joke, you're the worst teacher I've ever had!
Summer, that is great! I like the delivery because I felt your anger!
Thank you.
You're a fat loser and you have body odor.
...All right, all right! Now, is everybody nice and pissed off?
God of Rock, thank you for this chance to kick ass. We are your humble servants. Please give us the power to blow people's minds with our high voltage rock. In your name we pray, Amen.
Those that can't do, teach, and those that can't teach, teach gym.
What do they all have?
It's a rare blood disease: ""Stick-it-to-da-man-noisis"".
What's that? I've never heard of it.
You're lucky. Because it's hell.
You're gonna talk to me about style? You can't even dress yourself... look at that bow tie.
Don't you be talkin' about my bow tie.
8:15 to 10, rock history. 10 to 11, rock appreciation in theory. And then band practice till the end of the day.
What about math?
No, not important.
Katie, what was that thing you were playing today, the big thing?
Cello.
Ok. This is a bass guitar. And it's the exact same thing but instead of playing it like this you tip it on the side... cello, you got a bass.
In the end of time, there was a man who knew the road. And the writing was written on the stone. In the ancient time, an artist led the way, but no one seemed to understand. In his heart he knew, the artist must be true, but the legend of the rent was way past due! Well you think you'll be just fine without me, but you're mine! You think you can kick me out of the band? Well there's just one problem there. The band is mine! How can you kick me out of what is mine? Well you're not hardcore unless you live hardcore, but the legend of the rent was way hardcore!
You've heard of Aretha Franklin, right?

She's a big lady. But when she sings, she blows people's minds. Everyone wants to party with Aretha! And, you know who else has a weight issue?
Who?
Me. But when I get up there and start doing my thing, people worship me! Because I'm sexy, and chubby, man.
Why don't you go on a diet?
Because I like to eat! Is that such a crime?
Come on man, we're on a mission. One great rock show can change the world... look out the window...
No way! That's so punk rock.
You, Freddy, what do you like to do?
I dunno.
Burn stuff?
Math is a wonderful thing. Math is a really cool thing. So get off your ath, let's do some math. Math, math, math, math, math. Three minus four is?
Negative one.
That's right. And six times a billion is?
Six billion?
Nailed it. And fifty-four is forty-five more than what is the answer, Marta?
Nine.
No, it's eight.
...No, it's nine.
...Yes, I was testing you... it's nine. And that's a magic number.
Give up, just quit, because in this life, you can't win. Yeah, you can try, but in the end you're just gonna lose, big time, because the world is run by the Man.
Who?
The Man. Oh, you don't know the Man? He's everywhere. In the White House, down the hall... Ms. Mullins, she's the Man. And the Man ruined the ozone, and he's burning down the Amazon, and he kidnapped Shamu and put her in a chlorine tank! Okay? And there used to be a way to stick it to the Man, it was called rock 'n roll. But guess what? Oh no. The Man ruined that, too, with a little thing called MTV! So don't waste your time trying to make anything cool, or pure, or awesome, 'cause the Man is just gonna call you a fat washed up loser and crush your soul. So do yourselves a favor and just GIVE UP!
In the words of AC/DC: We roll tonight... to the guitar bite... and for those about to rock... I salute you.
I'm a teacher. All I need are minds for molding.
Groupie?
What's the matter?
You want me to be a groupie?
Well, a groupie's an important job.
I researched groupies on the Internet. They're sluts! They sleep with the band!
No, that's not true. They're like cheerleaders.
Lead guitar... Zack Attack. On bass... Posh Spice. On keyboards, Mr. Cool. And on drums, Spazzy McGee. OK, Blondie, Brace Face, you're singing backup. All right, Tough Guy, Shortstop, Fancy Pants, get over here. You're on security detail.
Can I be the band stylist instead?
Of course you can, Fancy Pants. OK. Carrot Top, Roadrunner, Turkey Sub, we're gonna have a lot of equipment... And you three...
groupies... As for me, I will be singing lead vocal and shredding guitar.
Would you care to join us, Mr. Schneebly?
Yeah.
Did I say that correctly? ""Schneebly""?
Actually, it's ""Schnayblay"".
Um, are we going to be goofing off like this every day?
Uh, we're not goofing off. We're creating musical fusion.
Well, um, are we going to be creating musical fusion every day?
Yeah, get used to it.
Okay, whose got food in here?
You're not gonna get in trouble, I'm hungry.
Look, the first thing you do when you start a band is talk about your influences. That's how you figure out what kind of band you want to be. So who do you like? Blondie?
Christina Aguilera.
Who? No. Come on. What? You, Shortstop.
Puff Daddy.
Wrong. Billy?
Liza Minnelli?
Come on come on come on/Touch me babe, bada bada, can't you see/ that I am not afraid, shaga tada!/ Lawrence is good at piano/He shall be rocking in my show, shaga tada!
They hate me.
No they don't.
Yes they do, I can see. I wasn't always like this, you know, I wasn't always wound this tight. There was a time where I was fun. I was funny! I was. But you can't be funny and be the principle of a prep school! No, you cannot. Because when it comes to their kids, these parents have no sense of humor. No. And if something goes wrong its my head in the smasher. And these parents will come down on me like a nucular bomb! I can't make a mistake! I gotta be perfect! And that pressure has turned me into something that I never wanted to be!
A bitch!
No you're not.
Yes I am. I am a big one!
What is that?
It's an encore. They want us to go play another song! It's good! Go, you guys!
Wait, no, no, just the band! Okay. Everybody, go!
Ok, here's the deal. I have a hangover. Who knows what that means?
Doesn't that mean you're drunk?
No. It means I was drunk yesterday.
It means you're an alcoholic.
Wrong.
You wouldn't come to work with a hangover unless you were an alcoholic. Dude, you got a disease!
Hmmm... hmmm... What's your name?
Freddy Jones.
Ok, Freddy Jones, shut up!
Now raise your goblet of rock. It's a toast to those who rock!
Read between the lines!
No you're not hardcore! Unless you live hardcore! And the legend of the rent was way hardcore!
Dude, is my face okay? I think you melted it off.
May I have the attention of the class: Today's ASSignment...
, , :
...kick some ass!
, , :
...kick some ass!
, , :
...kick some ass!
OK, Ms DumBum ain't your teacher today, I am, and I have a headache and the runs. So I say, time for recess!
... And therefore, E=MC2. Oh, Miss Mullins, come in.
I'm sorry to interupt but Miss Lemmons said she heard music coming from the classroom.
Music? Uh, music. I haven't heard any music. Uh oh, you know what, Miss Lemmons must be on crack, right, kids?
Uh, well, what's that?
Mr. S? We came up with some names for the band.
All right, hit me.
The Bumblebees?
No, it's too sissy.
The Koala Bears?
No, what are you talking about? It's too sissy.
Hey, Miss Mullins.
How about, Pig Rectum?
Michelle!
It's a science project.
Ms. Mullins, would like to get a cup of coffee with me?
You'd like me to get a coffee with you?
Yeah, I would.
Are you sure you don't sell coffee here?
Uh-huh, I'm quite sure.
The thing is, Mr. Schneebly...
Please... call me Dewey.
Dewey?
Ned. Ned. I was thinking of my other name. My middle name.
I LOVE THIS SONG!
Really?
Yes! Stevie Nicks!
Yeah... Stevie!
You know, she came to town and she did a concert and she was just so... wild! Oh my gosh! Oh!
Yeah, she put on the best show I've ever seen. And she is so much better live than she is on the album!
Yes, oh my gosh! No comparison!
You know, I'd like to take the kids to a concert.
Concert?
There is one at the end of the month... but you have a policy about field trips.
Would it be... educational?
Would it be educational? It would be VERY educational. They play Beethoven and Mozart and stuff.
Maybe we can make an exception!
YES!

Sings a song, sounds like she's singing whooo! Baby whoo! Said whooo!

Sings a song, sounds like she's singing whooo! Baby whoo! Said whooo!
Well I went today, maybe I will go again... TOMORROW!
Dude, I service society by rocking, OK? I'm out there on the front lines liberating people with my music!
Listen! You can't leave. You haven't heard our band.
Sorry, the bill is full. We're already overbooked.
No, let us just play one song. We're all here, we're ready to go.
Who are they?
They're my band.
Kids? What is this, some kind of gimmick?
No, it's not a gimmick. I know, they're kids, but they're awesome. Just listen!
Look, thanks for comin' down, but you're really not what we're looking for.
You listen to me! These kids have worked their little fingers to the bone just to play one song for you so you just sit down, shut up and listen!
Sheila, call security.
Would you tell Picasso to sell one of his guitars?
Oh, my God! He's an *idiot*!
Slap it.
Shoot it.
Kaboot it.
All right, that's it. Stop, you guys, stop. Seriously, you guys. All right, take five. Take five. You wanna go? All right. That was a good class.
I'll see you, man.
Does anyone play drums?
I play percussion.
Yea, that's cause he couldn't play anything else!
Shut up!
Uh, how long is the job?
My guess is, as much as a few weeks, but we do need somebody to start immediately.
Mm-hm. So how much are we talking here?
We pay our substitutes $650 a week. Now, do you know when Mr. Schneebly will be back?
Hold on a sec. Oh, you know what? I think he's just coming in right now. NED! PHONE!
Hello, this is Ned Schneebly.
You don't have to worry about me because I'm a hard-ass. And if a kid gets out of line, I got no problem smacking them in the head.
And we're gonna start a revolution, okay? And you're gonna be a funny little footnote on my epic ass!
Who are you, babe? This is my apartment, babe.
Oh oh, not if you don't pay your rent, it's not.
Summer, you're the class whatever. Go to the board
Factotum.
Factoter.
I'll have the rent by the end of the week, go tell the mayor.
Go! Play! Have fun! Now!
That was INCREDIBLE! Oh my gosh, the light shows, the guitar solos and... What it REALLY you playing?
So are you not mad with me?
MAD? I'm FURIOUS! I'm HORRIFIED! But your show and performance was so INCREDIBLE, SPECTACULAR and Sooooooooo AMAZING! I can't believe it
Come on, this project is called ""Rock Band""! I'm talking about bands that *rock*. Led Zeppelin!
Don't tell me you guys have never gotten the Led out. Jimmy Page? Robert Plant? Ring any bells? What about Sabbath?
AC/DC? Mötorhead?
Ugh, what do they teach in this place?
Ah... Okay. Teach, teach, teach... All right, look, here's the deal. I've got a hangover. Who knows what that means?
Doesn't that mean you're drunk?
No. It means I was drunk yesterday.
It means you're an alcoholic.
Wrong.
You wouldn't come to work hungover unless you were an alcoholic. Dude, you got a disease.
Hmm. Hmm. What's your name?
Freddy Jones.
Hmm. Freddy Jones, SHUT UP!
Shut up.
Point is, y'all can just chill today. We'll start on this crap-ola tomorrow.
Give me a platform. Let's rock, let's rock, today. Now do it to me.
Let's rock, let's rock, today.
That's good. Slap it, shoot it, ka-boot it.
I have been touched by your kids... and I'm pretty sure that I've touched them.
Now, what makes you mad more than anything in the world?
Billy?
You.

Factoter.
I'll have the rent by the end of the week, go tell the mayor.
Go! Play! Have fun! Now!
That was INCREDIBLE! Oh my gosh, the light shows, the guitar solos and... What it REALLY you playing?
So are you not mad with me?
MAD? I'm FURIOUS! I'm HORRIFIED! But your show and performance was so INCREDIBLE, SPECTACULAR and Sooooooooo AMAZING! I can't believe it
Come on, this project is called ""Rock Band""! I'm talking about bands that *rock*. Led Zeppelin!
Don't tell me you guys have never gotten the Led out. Jimmy Page? Robert Plant? Ring any bells? What about Sabbath?
AC/DC? Mötorhead?
Ugh, what do they teach in this place?
Ah... Okay. Teach, teach, teach... All right, look, here's the deal. I've got a hangover. Who knows what that means?
Doesn't that mean you're drunk?
No. It means I was drunk yesterday.
It means you're an alcoholic.
Wrong.
You wouldn't come to work hungover unless you were an alcoholic. Dude, you got a disease.
Hmm. Hmm. What's your name?
Freddy Jones.
Hmm. Freddy Jones, SHUT UP!
Shut up.
Point is, y'all can just chill today. We'll start on this crap-ola tomorrow.
Give me a platform. Let's rock, let's rock, today. Now do it to me.
Let's rock, let's rock, today.
That's good. Slap it, shoot it, ka-boot it."
Rob Gordon,AU,Loser Protagonist,"I will now sell five copies of ""The Three EPs"" by The Beta Band.
Go for it.
Who is this?
The Beta Band.
It's good.
I know.
I wanna date a musician.
I wanna live with a musician. She'd write songs at home and ask me what I thought of them, and maybe even include one of our little private jokes in the liner notes.
Maybe a little picture of me in the liner notes.
Just in the background somewhere.
She LIKED me. She liked ME. SHE like me... At least I think she did.
Hey, I'm not the smartest guy in the world, but I'm certainly not the dumbest. I mean, I've read books like ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"" and ""Love in the Time of Cholera"", and I think I've understood them. They're about girls, right? Just kidding. But I have to say my all-time favorite book is Johnny Cash's autobiography ""Cash"" by Johnny Cash.
I used to hate this song.
, :
Yeah.
, :
Yeah.
Now I kinda like it.
, :
Yeah.
, :
Yeah.
All three of us writers, we all experience music autobiographically.
I think a lot of people do.
So I'll have certain songs that mark certain times in our life and I think we're not rare that way.
Like I'll use music as fuel, you know?
Not like as inspiration but as fuel like if I need to get into a certain mindset I know there's certain songs that I can turn on that'll just... that's the gas and that'll get me right where I need to go.
Or if I need to get out of a certain state put on this song or that song and it just propels you.
I'm okay if that's what's upsetting you...
That is NOT what's upsetting me!
Well it fuckin' should be, shouldn't it?"
Jay,BJ,Stoner,"Yo man, tell me something about me.
You masturbate more than anyone on the planet.
Aw fuck, everyone knows that. Tell me something nobody knows.
When you do it, you're thinking about guys.
Dude, not all the time.
I don't mean to sound ungrateful... but what are you doing hanging around?
We're here to pick up chicks.
Excuse me?
We figure an abortion clinic is a good place to meet loose women. Why else would they be there unless they like to fuck?
So what's up? You have a friend for Silent Bob or are you just gonna do us both? If so, I'm first. I hate sloppy seconds.
You're a man of principle. Jersey's pretty far from McHenry, may I ask what brought you here?
Some fuck named John Hughes.
""16 Candles"" John Hughes?
You know that guy too? That fuckin' guy. He made this flick, ""16 Candles"". Not bad, there's tits in it but no bush. But Ebert over here don't give a shit about that kind of thing, 'cause he's like, all in love with this John Hughes guy.
He goes out and rents, like, every one of his movies. Fuckin' ""Breakfast Club"", where all these stupid kids actually show up for detention. Fuckin' ""Weird Science"", where this babe wants to take her gear off and get down, but oh no, she don't, 'cause it's a PG movie. And then ""Pretty in Pink"", which I can't even watch with this tubby bitch anymore 'cause every time he gets to the part where the redhead hooks up with her dream guy, he starts sobbin' like a little bitch with a skinned knee and shit. And there's nothing worse than watching a fuckin' fat man weep.
What exactly brought you to Illinois?
See, all these movies take place in this small town called Shermer in Illinois, where all the honeys are top-shelf but all the dudes are whiny pussies. Except for Judd Nelson, he was fuckin' harsh.
But best of all, there was no one dealin', man. And then it hits me: we could live like FAT rats if we were the blunt connection in Shermer, Illinois. So we collected some money we were owed and caught a bus. But you know what the fuck we found out when we got there? There IS no Shermer in Illinois. Movies are fuckin' bullshit.
I feel like I'm Han Solo, and you're Chewie, and she's Ben Kenobi, and we're in that fucked-up bar.
You're breaking up with us? Who do you think you are, lady? You can't go around breaking guys hearts like us. I fell in love with you!
I mean we fell in love with you! Guys like us just don't fall out of the fucking sky, you know!
Beautiful, naked, big-titted women just don't fall out of the sky, you know!
Oh, well. It was worth a try.
The whole fucking world's against us, dude, I swear to God.
You know what the dead do with most of their time? They watch the living. Especially in the shower.
I can't wait to die.
What are you, some kind of fucking chicken?
No, I was an ARTIST, STUPID! I WAS INSPIRATION! A muse has no place in battle!
So after the fallen were banished to hell, God turned on those who wouldn't fight, and Azrael was sent down with the demons.
Something he considers a GRAVE injustice!
Ah, come on! Don't tell me you NEVER questioned the judgement, Serendipity.
No. It never bothered me. So you were an artist! Big deal! Elvis was an artist. But that didn't stop him from joining the service in time of war. And that's why he's The King, and you're a schmuck.
Get offa me. I wanna see what's up. What the fuck is this shit? Who the fuck are you, lady? Why the fuck did you hug my head?
Quite a little mouth on him, isn't there?
What the fuck is this, The Piano? Why ain't this broad talking?
I believe the answers that you seek lie within my companion's eyes.
What the fuck does that mean? Has everyone gone fuckin' nuts? What the fuck happened to that guy's head? I want some...
You are the great great great GREAT great grand-niece of Jesus Christ.
So that would make Bethany... part black?
Bethany, you of anyone should know that tits dont make a woman. As you can see, I lack definition.
Hey! They're getting a free show! Let me see that shit!
Snootch to the motherfuckin' nootch!
You're not with the Fight-to-Lifer's?
You mean those fucks with the signs and pictures of dead babies? Shit no. Me and Silent Bob are pro-choice. A woman's body is her own fucking business.
I know they were just kids, but we kicked their fucken pube-less asses!
What gear are you in?
""Gear""?
All right, but let's say we're caught in a situation where we've got like five minutes to live, like a bomb or something is gonna go off. Would you fuck us then?
In that highly unlikely situation? Yeah, sure.
She's a slut. Bunnnng.
Jesus wasn't white, Jesus was black.
Well then why did he get written about and you didn't?
Well, he IS the son of God. Kinda hard to have a New Testament without him. So you fudge a few facts, put a spin on his ethnicity. Leavin' me out's okay because you still got twelve white boys to choose from.
Are you buying any of this shit?
Go back to your paper routes, you Mighty Duck fucks.
I didn't cum on you, Pete, I swear.
Oh, I'm Jay, and this is my hetero-lifemate Silent Bob. I don't know who those kids were, but they would've kicked yours and Lunchbox's asses if I hadn't represented.
Holy shit - you're a Jehovah's Witness! All the fine chicks that come out of that place, and we gotta get the one Jesus freak! Let's go, Silent Bob.
No. Wait...
I'll scream rape.
Get me a... Holy Bartender.
Never heard of it.
Ahh, he doesn't know how to make a Holy Bartender. You do, don't you, Muse?
Don't...
Ahh, anybody? No?
Well, I know how to make a Holy Bartender...
Get it?
Sweet Jesus, Azrael why?
Come on, demon, I wanna see you try that shit on someone who's already dead!
Now, now, apostle, you maintain that kind of an attitude and you and the barkeep won't be the only corpses in the room. The Christ bitch will join you.
Oh... wait. I get it. Holy Bartender! Ha, ha, ha!
What the shit is that?
Heh, me lead you? Lady look at me, I don't even know where the hell I am half the time!
I want to go with you.
What, steady? You want to be my girlfriend OK, but Silent Bob gets to live with us and you pay the rent.
What are you doing?
Proving to this bastard I ain't gay.
What?
Long story, forget it.
Like I ever drove before...
Smoke that motherfucker like it aint no thang!
I don't know what to say... or think... except...
That you offer us sex as a reward.
She's fucking pissed, dude. She'll never fuck us now. Well, maybe you, but definitely not me. Let me know how she is.
NOBODY IS FUCKING ME! YOU GOT THAT!
Stall Bartleby from going into that church.
How the hell am I supposed to do that?
Think of something.
I already did, but it takes two of us.
You want to hear something sick? I got half a stock when she kissed me.
So... does that mean Bethany's... part black?
So do you do anal? Is it true that chicks fart if you blast 'em in the ass?
Smoke that motherfucker like it ain't no thang.
You know, I hear pregnant women can have sex until their third trimester.
I'll keep that in mind.
No wonder he saw Jesus. Homey's rockin' the ganj.
I fell in love wit chew. We fell in love wit chew.
Hey Big Bird? Wanna play the Counting Game? Count the shells Sucker Duck!
Snoogans.
I get it! Holy Bartender! That's a great one!
You think someone threw him out of a plane with a message written on him like in Con Air? You ever see that flick?
Aww man! That sucked!
It's the living dead! Kill it! Kill it!
Con Air? Con Shit!
I didn't ask you out for sex.
Well, I'll take head.
If we're not gonna fuck, then what the fuck did you ask us out for?
What about sex?
No sex.
Fuck, man, I think this shit just kicked in.
That's what you get, Mother fucker!
His piece will be rubbing inside of your armor!
Sonny, let me make a deal wit ya.
Hahaha, Holy Bartender! I get it! That's a great one.
We can lay here all comatose like that John Doe Jersey bastard over there, or we can get makin' with the love.
What did you say?
'Makin' with the love.' It's a nice way of saying boning."
Luke Shapiro,BJ,Stoner,"Know what your problem is, Shapiro? It's that you just have this really shitty way of looking at things, ya know? I don't have that problem. I just look at the dopeness. But you, it's like you just look at the wackness, ya know?
I do?
All you have to do is look at me. And kiss me.
Do me a favor, Steph?
Huh?
Don't say nothin, ok? Just stand there til I leave. I wanna remember this. I've never done it before.
Never done what?
Had my heart broken.
In June I graduate. And then I go to my safety school. And then I get a little older. And then I die.
Luke, have you had any more thoughts about what you're gonna be as far as a profession goes?
Mom, he's got time.
I'm just asking!
Actually, I'm thinking about becoming a shrink.
Psychology! It's not quite the shoe business, but it's a very interesting field.
I figure I'm an expert because everyone around me is so fucking crazy, you know?
The city's a disaster, Luke. Its not like it used to be. It's plastic. One big fucking happy meal.
Some people like happy meals.
Some people like the Yankees too, Luke. It doesn't mean they're right.
There's enough assholes in the world, Dr. Squires, don't be another one.
You're a virgin?
No. Naw. I just haven't officially had sex yet.
Don't touch my daughter.
, :
Stepdaughter!
, :
Stepdaughter!
I got mad love for you shorty. That's on the real.
Peace out, forever!
Got another?
You smoke?
Everything.
So that was all bullshit right? All that stuff about embracing your pain, making it a part of you? You can't do this, you can't just give up. Life is hard and it's full of pain and what-not, but we take it cause there's great stuff too. And we can do it cause we have friends- because we have each other.
It doesn't matter.
Doesn't matter? Why not?
Because how could anything possibly matter right now?
Young men need sex, Luke. All men, actually... I- I can get you a hooker if you like.
God, I was *this* close to respecting you.
Big mistake, Luke. Call your girl. You don't need medication, Luke. You just need to get laid."
Kumar Patel,"BJ, BI","Stoner, Slacker","How is that not the worse news?
The laptop situation really only affects you, whereas the White Castle situation affects us both equally.
Neil, you wouldn't happen to know how to get on the highway from here, would you?
Dude, I don't even know where the fuck I am right now. I was at this party earlier tonight and some guy hooked me up with this incredible ""X"" - next thing I know I'm being thrown out of a moving car. I've been trippin' balls ever since.
That's crazy, dude. We've been having a pretty crazy, night, too. We've just been driving around looking for White Castle but we keep getting sidetracked.
Yeah, dude, you fascinate me. Forget White Castle, let's go get some pussy!
Huh?
It's a fucking sausage fest in here, bros. Let's get some poontang, THEN we'll go to White Castle.
No, Neil, you don't understand. We've been craving these burgers all night.
Yeah, I've been craving burgers, too. Furburgers. Come on, dudes, let's pick up some trim at a strip club. The Doogie line always works on strippers.
Lapdance...
There's a gas station. I'm gonaa see if I can get some directions.
You don't need dir- gah! Hurry up, dudes, hurry up! I'm losing wood.
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry...
Look, chill.
We'll be right back, Neil.
Dude, what is the deal with Neil Patrick Harris? Why is he so horny?
Rold? Is that you?
Kumar?
Hey, are the cops still here?
What the hell are you doing?
I just called and made up some story about a shooting in Millbrook Park.
Jesus Christ! What'd you do that for?
I'm fucking starving! I figured I'd bust you out and we'd go get some burgers.
Ahh.
'Scuse me, I just...
Huh?
I have to ask you, why'd you... wha... wha... why are you peeing... right here?
What?
I mean... why'd you pee right next to me when you could like, choose that bush, or...
Well, this bush looked like I should pee on it. Why are you peeing on it?
Well, no one was here when I chose this bush.
Oh, so you get to pee on it and no one else does? Huh?
No, it's just... I just...
This your bush? You have a special bond with this bush?
No, I just thought that...
You the king of the forest?
I'm sorry?
What?
You fuckin' tree-hugger. IS THIS YOUR SPECIAL BUSH?
Never mind. Forget it, I really don't feel like gettin' stabbed tonight.
Nice pubes.
Thanks.
Dude, where's my car?
Where's his car, dude?
What the hell are you doing with my wife?
Y-you said outside that we could have sex with her!
Shit! Shit!
I most certainly did not!
Yes you did!
Did not!
Yes you did!
Oh, no, I didn't.
You did, you did.
You sure...?
You said it!
My mistake! Well, since we're all here... How 'bout a four-some?
Ding-dong! May I interject for a second? As a Burger Shack employee for the past three years, if there's one thing I've learned, it's that if you're craving White Castle, the burgers here just don't cut it. In fact, just thinking about those tender little White Castle burgers with those little, itty-bitty grilled onions that just explode in your mouth like flavor crystals every time you bite into one... just makes me want to burn this motherfucker down. Come on, Pookie, let's burn this motherfucker down! Come on, Pookie! Let's burn it, Pookie! Let's burn this motherfucker down! Let's burn it down! Let's burn it! So you guys maybe should just suck it up and go to White Castle.
You can always get your work done in the car.
Let's do it.
All right. Awesome. Then listen, listen - no matter what, we are not ending this night without White Castle in our stomachs. Agreed?
Agreed.
Wise choice. You guys might have wanted to stay away from our special sauce tonight. Me and Pookie, we added a secret ingredient. I'll give you a hint. It's semen.
Semen.
Animal semen.
Roldy! Roldy! dude, you gotta come quick. There is these two filthy pussies just aching to get boned by us!
I mean... duh... that there are these two lovely young pussies who would like to have a chat with you and I.
Do you actually believe that after the way you've just behaved that I would even consider recommending you for admission?
No. I'm gonna be honest with you. The only reason I'm applying is so my dad will keep paying for my apartment. I really don't have a desire to go to med school.
But you have perfect MCAT scores!
Yeah, just cause you're hung like a moose doesn't mean you gotta do porn.
Hey, what's that smell?
What smell? Kumar...

Hey Kumar! Kumar! Where are you...
Kumar! Still in jail, asshole! Come here!
Do you know what the hell we had to go through after you took the car?
Yeah, it was a dick move on my part. That's why I'm paying for your meal. Prick.
Here's 50 for the meal, and 200 for the car.
What happened to my car?
I made some love stains in the back. You'll see...
Dude, we're so high right now!
We're not low!
Go on inside, boys, and make yourselves at home. You can rest up, get something to drink, fuck my wife, whatever you want. Just don't do anything the good lord would'nt do.
Dude am I going deaf or did he just say we could fuck his wife?
Dude, am I really high, or is this actually working?
Both.
So she's kinda fucking cute. Let her touch your penis.
I forgot my cell phone.
You wanna run back and get it?
No, we've gone too far.
How were Katie Holmes' tits?
You know the Holocaust?
Yeah?
Picture the opposite of that!
Nice!
What kind of name is that anyhow? Kumar? What is that five o's or two u's?
No, it's actually one ""u""
Yeah, bullshit.
What the hell are you doing? Gawd!
You been out cold for the past half an hour. I figured maybe if I did some gay shit, you'd wake up.
If you did some gay shit? What kinda - where are we? Didn't we come here on a cheetah? Where's the cheetah?
It ran away. Listen, forget about the cheetah, okay?
Are those my scissors? Dude, I trim my nose hair with those!
Dude, I've been cutting my ass hair with them for the past six months.
Let's find us some tunes baby,
Cole's extreme mix volume 5, what is this shit?
These guys are fucking posers!
Thank you, come again!
I hope you are here to apologize for what you did at your interview this afternoon.
What the hell's wrong with you, Kumar? God! You're, like, 22 years old. I mean, when are you going to stop this post-college rebel baloney? Like your life's so hard.
Eat my balls, Saikat.
I will not tolerate this business from you any longer. You have one more interview tomorrow morning, and if I hear from Dr. Wein that you are anything short of spectacular, I'll completely cut you off!
Dad, come on.
Daddy is not coming on anything! You will be there, and you will behave. I have put too much time and energy into you to let you go and fuck it all up!
...The universe tends to unfold as it should.
What is that? Some fortune cookie?
I want that.
What? A Hot Dog Heaven super chili cheese dog?
No. I want that feeling. The feeling that comes over a man when he gets exactly what he desires. I need that feeling!
Are you saying what I think you're saying?
We gotta go to White Castle.
YES! YES! I knew you had it in you dude!
I can't believe you were gonna ditch for the Joy Luck Club, dude. You know what their parties are like.
C'mon, what did you want me to say? I was under pressure.
Just say no. That's all it takes.
Here.
Take a hit of that.
Here, that's sixt - 80 bucks.
80 bucks?
Yeah, 80 bucks.
Yo, this is worth 40 tops bro!
Bro? I'm not your bro, bro. ok, and that's 80 bucks. You don't feel like getting high tonight? If you don't feel like getting high, that's cool with me because there's lots of people around here. See this guy? Hey, what's up, George? I smoke buds with George all the time.
What kind of a hippie are you?
What kind of hippie am I? Man, I'm a business hippie, I understand the concept of supply and demand.
Now we're in Newark, of all places. You know we're gonna get shot.
Maybe it's not as bad as they say. Maybe it's just a bunch of hype.
Check it out. Those guys look like a lame version of us.
, :
Holy shit!
, :
Holy shit!
Let's get the fuck outta here. Go! Go! Drive! Drive!
Yeah, that was your fault.
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
Oh, nice. 16 Candles is on, man.
And the award for the least heterosexual statement ever made in this apartment goes to... Harold Lee! Come on down, man! Take a bow!
Shut up, man. It's a classic.
I am so hungry. I'm gonna eat, like, 20 of those burgers, man.
Dude, fuckin' I will see your 20 burgers and raise you 5 orders of fries.
Hang on a second, nurse. What we should probably use is marijuana. That'll sufficiently sedate the patient for surgery.
Marijuana?... But why?
We don't have time for questions. We need marijuana now, as much of it as possible! Like a big bag of it.
Check out those boils on his neck! You gotta look! One of them is actually pulsating!
Will you shut up? He's right next to me! He can hear you!
Ugh! Now there's some sort of Puss! Just look!

See? Isn't that the most disgusting thing you've ever seen?
You think that just because you're whispering he can't hear what you are saying? He's two feet away from us! He can hear this entire conversation! He can hear me talking... right now!
Don't worry about it, he can't hear anything. Not with all that crust in his ear.
I heard everything you said.
Hey, why don't you leave that guy alone and go jerk off to some snowboarding videos or something?
So where you going to go now, Neil?
Wherever God takes me!
So, I gotta ask you Neil, did you ever get it on with Wanda off the set?
Dude, I humped every piece of ass ever on that show.
Even the chick who played the hot nurse?
No... I didn't go all the way with her.
Is there... is there a problem, Officer... Palumbo?
Is there a problem? Have you heard of jaywalking?
Yes, I have. I'm really sorry. It won't happen again.
That's great. I'm writing you up a ticket.
A ticket? Are you serious?
Who the fuck are you, shitwad?
$220? Are you crazy? Excuse me, Officer sir! Let me just take a few guesses here!
I'm really sorry for this...
No sudden movements! Back it up!
You were probably the big asshole in high school, right?
Absolutely right.
And you used to pick on guys like us everyday for fun?
With pleasure.
But then graduation day came! We went to college, while you went nowhere. And then you began to think to yourself, ""Gee. How can I still give them grief? Oh, I know, I'll just become a cop."" Yeah? Well, congratulations! Your dream has come true! Now, why don't you just take this quiet little Asian guy with the American name that treats you so well and give him some more tickets or better just take him to jail.
Even better.
You're going downtown thanks to your friend here.
Oh, great American name, Harold!
Yaaah!
Huh.
Oh, shoot.
Excuse me officer. Let me take a couple of guesses. You were probably the big asshole in your high school, right?
Absolutely right.
Used to pick on guys like us every day, right?
With pleasure.
Then graduation day came, and we went to college, and you went nowhere, and you thought, ""Hey, how can I still give them shit? I know, I'll become a cop.""
Shotgun anus!
I want 30 sliders, 5 french fries, and 4 large cherry cokes.
I want the same except make mine diet cokes.
Hey Roldy?
What?
There's something I forgot to tell you.
What?
I never hang-glided before.
WHAT?
Well, congratu-fuckin'-lations, your dream has come true!
Dude, am I going deaf or did he just say we could fuck his wife?

Ah! AH! What the hell are you doing?
You've been out cold for the past half hour, I figured if I did some gay shit you'd wake up.
Go on inside, boys, and make yourselves at home. You can rest up, get something to drink, fuck my wife, whatever you want. Just don't do anything Jesus wouldn't!
Did he just say we could fuck his wife?
We should give this man some marijuana. Nurse! Get all the medical marijuana you can! Like a big bag of it?
Marijuana?... But why?
Kumar: My names Kumar.
Freakshow:
How are you, Kenny?
Kumar:
Um... And this is Harold.
Freakshow: Hi, Gerald how are you?

Nice pubes.
Thanks.
Dude, where's my car?
Where's his car, dude?
What the hell are you doing with my wife?
Y-you said outside that we could have sex with her!
Shit! Shit!
I most certainly did not!
Yes you did!
Did not!
Yes you did!
Oh, no, I didn't.
You did, you did.
You sure...?
You said it!
My mistake! Well, since we're all here... How 'bout a four-some?
Ding-dong! May I interject for a second? As a Burger Shack employee for the past three years, if there's one thing I've learned, it's that if you're craving White Castle, the burgers here just don't cut it. In fact, just thinking about those tender little White Castle burgers with those little, itty-bitty grilled onions that just explode in your mouth like flavor crystals every time you bite into one... just makes me want to burn this motherfucker down. Come on, Pookie, let's burn this motherfucker down! Come on, Pookie! Let's burn it, Pookie! Let's burn this motherfucker down! Let's burn it down! Let's burn it! So you guys maybe should just suck it up and go to White Castle.
You can always get your work done in the car.
Let's do it.
All right. Awesome. Then listen, listen - no matter what, we are not ending this night without White Castle in our stomachs. Agreed?
Agreed.
Wise choice. You guys might have wanted to stay away from our special sauce tonight. Me and Pookie, we added a secret ingredient. I'll give you a hint. It's semen.
Semen.
Animal semen.
Roldy! Roldy! dude, you gotta come quick. There is these two filthy pussies just aching to get boned by us!
I mean... duh... that there are these two lovely young pussies who would like to have a chat with you and I.
Do you actually believe that after the way you've just behaved that I would even consider recommending you for admission?
No. I'm gonna be honest with you. The only reason I'm applying is so my dad will keep paying for my apartment. I really don't have a desire to go to med school.
But you have perfect MCAT scores!
Yeah, just cause you're hung like a moose doesn't mean you gotta do porn.
Hey, what's that smell?
What smell? Kumar...

Hey Kumar! Kumar! Where are you...
Kumar! Still in jail, asshole! Come here!
Do you know what the hell we had to go through after you took the car?
Yeah, it was a dick move on my part. That's why I'm paying for your meal. Prick.
Here's 50 for the meal, and 200 for the car.
What happened to my car?
I made some love stains in the back. You'll see...
Dude, we're so high right now!
We're not low!
Go on inside, boys, and make yourselves at home. You can rest up, get something to drink, fuck my wife, whatever you want. Just don't do anything the good lord would'nt do.
Dude am I going deaf or did he just say we could fuck his wife?
Dude, am I really high, or is this actually working?
Both.
So she's kinda fucking cute. Let her touch your penis.
I forgot my cell phone.
You wanna run back and get it?
No, we've gone too far.
How were Katie Holmes' tits?
You know the Holocaust?
Yeah?
Picture the opposite of that!
Nice!
What kind of name is that anyhow? Kumar? What is that five o's or two u's?
No, it's actually one ""u""
Yeah, bullshit.
What the hell are you doing? Gawd!
You been out cold for the past half an hour. I figured maybe if I did some gay shit, you'd wake up.
If you did some gay shit? What kinda - where are we? Didn't we come here on a cheetah? Where's the cheetah?
It ran away. Listen, forget about the cheetah, okay?
Are those my scissors? Dude, I trim my nose hair with those!
Dude, I've been cutting my ass hair with them for the past six months.
Let's find us some tunes baby,
Cole's extreme mix volume 5, what is this shit?
These guys are fucking posers!
Thank you, come again!
I hope you are here to apologize for what you did at your interview this afternoon.
What the hell's wrong with you, Kumar? God! You're, like, 22 years old. I mean, when are you going to stop this post-college rebel baloney? Like your life's so hard.
Eat my balls, Saikat.
I will not tolerate this business from you any longer. You have one more interview tomorrow morning, and if I hear from Dr. Wein that you are anything short of spectacular, I'll completely cut you off!
Dad, come on.
Daddy is not coming on anything! You will be there, and you will behave. I have put too much time and energy into you to let you go and fuck it all up!
...The universe tends to unfold as it should.
What is that? Some fortune cookie?
I want that.
What? A Hot Dog Heaven super chili cheese dog?
No. I want that feeling. The feeling that comes over a man when he gets exactly what he desires. I need that feeling!
Are you saying what I think you're saying?
We gotta go to White Castle.
YES! YES! I knew you had it in you dude!
I can't believe you were gonna ditch for the Joy Luck Club, dude. You know what their parties are like.
C'mon, what did you want me to say? I was under pressure.
Just say no. That's all it takes.
Here.
Take a hit of that.
Here, that's sixt - 80 bucks.
80 bucks?
Yeah, 80 bucks.
Yo, this is worth 40 tops bro!
Bro? I'm not your bro, bro. ok, and that's 80 bucks. You don't feel like getting high tonight? If you don't feel like getting high, that's cool with me because there's lots of people around here. See this guy? Hey, what's up, George? I smoke buds with George all the time.
What kind of a hippie are you?
What kind of hippie am I? Man, I'm a business hippie, I understand the concept of supply and demand.
Now we're in Newark, of all places. You know we're gonna get shot.
Maybe it's not as bad as they say. Maybe it's just a bunch of hype.
Check it out. Those guys look like a lame version of us.
, :
Holy shit!
, :
Holy shit!
Let's get the fuck outta here. Go! Go! Drive! Drive!
Yeah, that was your fault.
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
Oh, nice. 16 Candles is on, man.
And the award for the least heterosexual statement ever made in this apartment goes to... Harold Lee! Come on down, man! Take a bow!
Shut up, man. It's a classic.
I am so hungry. I'm gonna eat, like, 20 of those burgers, man.
Dude, fuckin' I will see your 20 burgers and raise you 5 orders of fries.
Hang on a second, nurse. What we should probably use is marijuana. That'll sufficiently sedate the patient for surgery.
Marijuana?... But why?
We don't have time for questions. We need marijuana now, as much of it as possible! Like a big bag of it.
Check out those boils on his neck! You gotta look! One of them is actually pulsating!
Will you shut up? He's right next to me! He can hear you!
Ugh! Now there's some sort of Puss! Just look!

See? Isn't that the most disgusting thing you've ever seen?
You think that just because you're whispering he can't hear what you are saying? He's two feet away from us! He can hear this entire conversation! He can hear me talking... right now!
Don't worry about it, he can't hear anything. Not with all that crust in his ear.
I heard everything you said.
Hey, why don't you leave that guy alone and go jerk off to some snowboarding videos or something?
So where you going to go now, Neil?
Wherever God takes me!
So, I gotta ask you Neil, did you ever get it on with Wanda off the set?
Dude, I humped every piece of ass ever on that show.
Even the chick who played the hot nurse?
No... I didn't go all the way with her.
Is there... is there a problem, Officer... Palumbo?
Is there a problem? Have you heard of jaywalking?
Yes, I have. I'm really sorry. It won't happen again.
That's great. I'm writing you up a ticket.
A ticket? Are you serious?
Who the fuck are you, shitwad?
$220? Are you crazy? Excuse me, Officer sir! Let me just take a few guesses here!
I'm really sorry for this...
No sudden movements! Back it up!
You were probably the big asshole in high school, right?
Absolutely right.
And you used to pick on guys like us everyday for fun?
With pleasure.
But then graduation day came! We went to college, while you went nowhere. And then you began to think to yourself, ""Gee. How can I still give them grief? Oh, I know, I'll just become a cop."" Yeah? Well, congratulations! Your dream has come true! Now, why don't you just take this quiet little Asian guy with the American name that treats you so well and give him some more tickets or better just take him to jail.
Even better.
You're going downtown thanks to your friend here.
Oh, great American name, Harold!
Yaaah!
Huh.
Oh, shoot.
Excuse me officer. Let me take a couple of guesses. You were probably the big asshole in your high school, right?
Absolutely right.
Used to pick on guys like us every day, right?
With pleasure.
Then graduation day came, and we went to college, and you went nowhere, and you thought, ""Hey, how can I still give them shit? I know, I'll become a cop.""
Shotgun anus!
I want 30 sliders, 5 french fries, and 4 large cherry cokes.
I want the same except make mine diet cokes.
Hey Roldy?
What?
There's something I forgot to tell you.
What?
I never hang-glided before.
WHAT?
Well, congratu-fuckin'-lations, your dream has come true!
Dude, am I going deaf or did he just say we could fuck his wife?

Ah! AH! What the hell are you doing?
You've been out cold for the past half hour, I figured if I did some gay shit you'd wake up.
Go on inside, boys, and make yourselves at home. You can rest up, get something to drink, fuck my wife, whatever you want. Just don't do anything Jesus wouldn't!
Did he just say we could fuck his wife?
We should give this man some marijuana. Nurse! Get all the medical marijuana you can! Like a big bag of it?
Marijuana?... But why?
Kumar: My names Kumar.
Freakshow:
How are you, Kenny?
Kumar:
Um... And this is Harold.
Freakshow: Hi, Gerald how are you?
Bitch! Learn how to fuckin' make coffee, you fucking whore!
I fear that I will always be / A lonely number like root three / A three is all that's good and right, / Why must my three keep out of sight / Beneath a vicious square root sign, / I wish instead I were a nine / For nine could thwart this evil trick, / with just some quick arithmetic / I know I'll never see the sun, as 1.7321 / Such is my reality, a sad irrationality / When hark! What is this I see, / Another square root of a three / Has quietly come waltzing by, / Together now we multiply / To form a number we prefer, / Rejoicing as an integer / We break free from our mortal bonds / And with a wave of magic wands / Our square root signs become unglued / And love for me has been renewed.
So you get high and you put other people who smoke weed in jail?
DUH!
That's so hypocritical!
Oh yeah? Well let me ask you something, Kumar, do you like giving hand jobs?
No sir.
Do you like gettin' hand jobs?
Heh, yeah.
Yeah well, that makes you a fuckin' hypocriticizer too, so shut the fuck up! Now smoke my weed.
It's because of assholes like you that we're even in this fucking place - fucking cowards!
Well maybe if the people in your country stopped eating *doughnuts* and started realizing what their government is doing to the world, ""assholes"" like us wouldn't exist!
Fuck you! Doughnuts are awesome!
Anyway, last day of shooting, I told her. I said... ""T-Bird, we're gonna have to break up.""
Why did you do that?
I didn't think I could take on that kind of responsibility. It was such a big mistake.
Why? I mean, with T-Bird gone, couldn't you have sex with whoever you wanted?
Let me be clear. There is nothing on the planet that I love more than a hot, new pussy.
Sure.
Nothing. What does the P.H. Stands for in N.P.H?
Patrick Harris.
No, common mistake. Poon handler.
I've never had to suck a dick before.
Me neither.
I bet it sucks dick!
You remember that time that you broke into the animal lab and like stole that monkey and put it in Andy Rosenberg's dorm room?
First of all, that was Goldstein's idea, and second of all, had I known that the monkey had AIDS, I never would've done that.
That looks like Osama Bin Laden's beard!
Yo, I'm not joining the mile high club with you!
What about the really high club?
In less than eight hours we're gonna be in Amsterdam. This is nuts. This is nuts!
I know, dude. It's gonna be exactly like Eurotrip only it's not going to suck. It's going to be awesome.
It's not not going to be awesome.
I have a lost love story of my own.
Oh yeah?
I'll never forget her. Her name was Tashonda. She was Whoopi Goldberg's stand-in. Her skin was so soft, her lips were so sweet. She had these tiny little Hershey kisses nipples that you just wanted to suck on all night long. Anyway, last day of shooting I told her. I said ""T-Bird, we're gonna have to break up"".
Why'd you do that?
I didn't think I could take on that kind of responsibility. What a big mistake!

The point is boys, even though I loved having sex with some hot random trim, a day hasn't gone by where I haven't thought of Tashonda. Every time I see a bag of Hershey kisses, my balls get so wet.
Sir, I need you to step aside please. I need to search you.
Did I beep?
Oh no, you didn't beep. Just a random security check. If you can just step aside, please. Just over here.
Random, huh?
Yeah.
So this has nothing to do with my ethnicity?
Come on, just do what the guy says.
Sir, it's our job as airport security to search for all possible weapons or illegal drugs.
So just because of the color of my skin you assume that I have drugs on me? Are you a racist?
Racist? Dude, I'm black!
He's black! He's not racist!
Please, dude. You're barely even brown. Compared to me, you look like Matthew Perry.
No...!
Hey, who you callin' Matthew Perry, bitch?
I'm calling you Matthew Perry, you Matthew Perry-looking bitch!
Harold Lee, I'd like to introduce you to an invention of mine.
Meet the smokeless bong.
You made this?
You know I did. When you were slaving away at work, I was actually being a productive member of society.
Are all the guards in Guantanamo Bay gay?
Fuck no! There ain't nothing gay about getting your dick sucked! You're the ones that're gay for sucking my dick!
What?
In fact, it creeps me out just being around you fags! Alright, get down on your knees and open your mouths.
Why don't you kick our asses instead?
GET ON YOUR FUCKING KNEES NOW!
Hope you boys like extra mayo.
What's up with this party?
What do you mean?
There's exposed vagina all over your house.
Oh, yeah, that was my idea. I don't know about you guys - I'm sick of all the hype over topless.
Really? I always liked topless.
Yeah, well I'm starting the bottomless trend! Hence the bottomless party.
This car is frickin' sweet!
Oh yeah! Yeah, it's sweet! 'Cuz we're fugitives. Driving a yellow convertible with the top down, dressed like assholes!
Oh God, dude!
What the fuck? What the fuck? What are you doing?
I'm taking the most incredible dump of all time, man.
You couldn't wait until I got out of the shower?
Um, may I remind you that we both just ate 30 burgers and 4 large orders of fries?
Don't worry, in a little bit I'm sure it'll hit you too.
Maybe, but I'm going to wait until you get out of the shower!
Well don't wait too long. We gotta leave for the airport in an hour.
An hour?
Uh-huh. Oh, hey, Roldy?
Yeah?
Nice pubes.
Why does everything has to be a huge argument with you, man?
Because this is America, dude, and as long as I have my freedom of speech no one's going to shut me up.
I'm telling you Jorge, the first thing you have to do when you get to America - buy a device called TiVo. Okay? Freedom means nothing if you're a slave to regular programming. I promise you that.
Did you take calculus in high school or something?
No, actually my dad taught me in sixth grade.
What are you, like Doogie Howser?
No. Although that would be incredible. He's my hero. I love that show.
The other night I ended up at that Asian party and I shtupped Cindy Kim!
Shut the fuck up! Are you serious?
Yeah man, she even gave me a blumpkin!
What is a blumpkin?
It's when a girl gives you head while you're sitting on the toilet taking a shit!
Look how cute this deer is, dude. Not like those asshole deer in New Jersey.
Hey, you don't happen to have a Baby Ruth on you, do you?
No. Why do you need a Baby Ruth?
That's how Chunk got over with Sloth in The Goonies.
This thing looks like Sloth?
All I saw was the creature's hand.
The hand looks like Sloth?
The fucking hand of an evil monster, dude. Like claws and shit!
I thought you were joking when you said that you have an inbred son who lives in your basement?
Well it ain't a joke! Raylene and I here are siblings. And we get it on. But that don't mean we oughtta be judged!
I have this fantasy...
What is it?
I thought it would be kind of cool to bring someone else in bed with us?
Who?
Hey baby.
Is that a KKK bonfire?
Yeah, I think it is.
Maybe we should get the fuck out of here.
Thanks for stopping.
No problem.
Neil?
Gary and Kumar!
What are you doing here, man?
This is where God took me.
Can you focus on the driving? Focus on the road. You've had dozens of shrooms, my friend.
Uh, dude, I was able to perform an apendectomy at age 14. I think I can handle a couple of mushrooms.
Wasn't that just the TV show?
Holy fucking shit that was awesome!
Try having that conversation on shrooms. I deserve an Oscar for that performance!
You do!
Dudes, I'm going to take a little detour on the way, alright?
No, Neil, no. We're almost there, man.
No buts! No buts! I'm going to a whorehouse and I'm gonna get my fuck on! If you two don't want to get your dicks wet, that's fine with me!
We gotta get Neil!
Why?
We're stealing his car! We can't leave him back there!
He stole your fucking car last week!
I fucked up, okay? And I always fuck up. I am a fuck up!
You think?
Harold, you're my best friend, dude. You mean the world to me, man. I love you.
Queers.
And I promise you if we figure out a way to get out of this, I'm gonna change, okay? It's not just going to be about Kumar all the time. It's going to be about Kumar and Harold.
Harold and Kumar.
I kind of like the first way better.
Oh man, that was so fucking extreme!
Look, I can't promise you the kind of lifestyle that Colton could. I can't promise you that I'll mature over night. But what I can promise you is...
Sorry, I smoked weed with the president and I totally forgot what I was going to say.
Ladies and Roldy, how would you like to get really fucking high since we're in Amsterdam?
Yeah.
Shall we?
Sounds like a plan.
, :
Let's do it!
, :
Let's do it!
You guys wanna hear something fucked up and awesome? I took a Korean guy's toothbrush and I rubbed it all over my dick!
You did that?
You fucking pissed on me you racist fuck!
Hey, I ran into Todd at Whitaker's, of course. He told me, uh, you got a job working for the government!
Yeah! Yeah, President Bush and my dad were in the same fraternity!
Oh, sheesh.
When he gave my dad that appointment in the Defense Department, I became his right hand man.
Douche.
Dude, this thing is huge! I think it still has cheese on it!"
Harold Lee,BJ,Stoner,"So what are you in here for?
For being black.
Seriously.
I am serious. You wanna know what happened? I was walking out of a Barnes & Noble, and a cop stops me. Now evidently, a black guy robbed a store in Newark. I told him, ""I haven't even been to Newark in months."" So he starts beating me with his gun, telling me to stop resisting arrest.
Holy shit! What'd you do?
I kept saying, ""I understand I'm under arrest. Now please stop beating me.""
I'm sorry, I don't understand how you can be so calm about all this.
Look at me. I'm fat, black, can't dance, and I have two gay fathers. People have been messing with me my whole life. I learned a long time ago there's no sense getting all riled up every time a bunch of idiots give you a hard time. In the end, the universe tends to unfold as it should. Plus I have a really large penis. That keeps me happy.
Did Doogie Howser just steal my fucking car?
How is that not the worse news?
The laptop situation really only affects you, whereas the White Castle situation affects us both equally.
Neil, you wouldn't happen to know how to get on the highway from here, would you?
Dude, I don't even know where the fuck I am right now. I was at this party earlier tonight and some guy hooked me up with this incredible ""X"" - next thing I know I'm being thrown out of a moving car. I've been trippin' balls ever since.
That's crazy, dude. We've been having a pretty crazy, night, too. We've just been driving around looking for White Castle but we keep getting sidetracked.
Yeah, dude, you fascinate me. Forget White Castle, let's go get some pussy!
Huh?
It's a fucking sausage fest in here, bros. Let's get some poontang, THEN we'll go to White Castle.
No, Neil, you don't understand. We've been craving these burgers all night.
Yeah, I've been craving burgers, too. Furburgers. Come on, dudes, let's pick up some trim at a strip club. The Doogie line always works on strippers.
Lapdance...
There's a gas station. I'm gonaa see if I can get some directions.
You don't need dir- gah! Hurry up, dudes, hurry up! I'm losing wood.
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry...
Look, chill.
We'll be right back, Neil.
Dude, what is the deal with Neil Patrick Harris? Why is he so horny?
Rold? Is that you?
Kumar?
Hey, are the cops still here?
What the hell are you doing?
I just called and made up some story about a shooting in Millbrook Park.
Jesus Christ! What'd you do that for?
I'm fucking starving! I figured I'd bust you out and we'd go get some burgers.
Dude, where's my car?
Where's his car, dude?
What the hell are you doing with my wife?
Y-you said outside that we could have sex with her!
Shit! Shit!
I most certainly did not!
Yes you did!
Did not!
Yes you did!
Oh, no, I didn't.
You did, you did.
You sure...?
You said it!
My mistake! Well, since we're all here... How 'bout a four-some?
Ding-dong! May I interject for a second? As a Burger Shack employee for the past three years, if there's one thing I've learned, it's that if you're craving White Castle, the burgers here just don't cut it. In fact, just thinking about those tender little White Castle burgers with those little, itty-bitty grilled onions that just explode in your mouth like flavor crystals every time you bite into one... just makes me want to burn this motherfucker down. Come on, Pookie, let's burn this motherfucker down! Come on, Pookie! Let's burn it, Pookie! Let's burn this motherfucker down! Let's burn it down! Let's burn it! So you guys maybe should just suck it up and go to White Castle.
You can always get your work done in the car.
Let's do it.
All right. Awesome. Then listen, listen - no matter what, we are not ending this night without White Castle in our stomachs. Agreed?
Agreed.
Wise choice. You guys might have wanted to stay away from our special sauce tonight. Me and Pookie, we added a secret ingredient. I'll give you a hint. It's semen.
Semen.
Animal semen.
Hey, what's that smell?
What smell? Kumar...

Hey Kumar! Kumar! Where are you...
Kumar! Still in jail, asshole! Come here!
Do you know what the hell we had to go through after you took the car?
Yeah, it was a dick move on my part. That's why I'm paying for your meal. Prick.
Here's 50 for the meal, and 200 for the car.
What happened to my car?
I made some love stains in the back. You'll see...
Dude, we're so high right now!
We're not low!
Dude, am I really high, or is this actually working?
Both.
Back off cockboy, what I said him goes double for you.
Cockboy, you just call me cockboy?
Yeah, you know I did. You're just stalling cuz you're not quick enough to think of a comeback.
You think I'm not quick enough. Guy thinks I'm not quick enough. Well I got news for you. I am quick enough!... Cockboy!
I forgot my cell phone.
You wanna run back and get it?
No, we've gone too far.
What the hell are you doing? Gawd!
You been out cold for the past half an hour. I figured maybe if I did some gay shit, you'd wake up.
If you did some gay shit? What kinda - where are we? Didn't we come here on a cheetah? Where's the cheetah?
It ran away. Listen, forget about the cheetah, okay?

YES! YES! I knew you had it in you dude!

C'mon, what did you want me to say? I was under pressure.
Just say no. That's all it takes.
Here.
Take a hit of that.
Now we're in Newark, of all places. You know we're gonna get shot.
Maybe it's not as bad as they say. Maybe it's just a bunch of hype.
Check it out. Those guys look like a lame version of us.
, :
Holy shit!
, :
Holy shit!
Let's get the fuck outta here. Go! Go! Drive! Drive!
Yeah, that was your fault.
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
Oh, nice. 16 Candles is on, man.
And the award for the least heterosexual statement ever made in this apartment goes to... Harold Lee! Come on down, man! Take a bow!
Shut up, man. It's a classic.
This is either a really smart move or by far the stupidest thing that we have ever tried.
Sorry, kids. We ain't goin' nowhere. We're watching The Gift. Supposedly Katie Holmes shows her titties in this movie.
Is that all you Jews ever think about? Tits?
Katie Holmes is a nice, respectable, wholesome girl... and I'm gonna see her boobs.
Oh man, the things I would eat out of her ass... you have no idea!
Ugh! That is a completely disgusting and vulgar statement.
So is, ""I wanna bang Britney Spears on the bathroom floor,"" but it's true.
Touché.
I am so hungry. I'm gonna eat, like, 20 of those burgers, man.
Dude, fuckin' I will see your 20 burgers and raise you 5 orders of fries.
Check out those boils on his neck! You gotta look! One of them is actually pulsating!
Will you shut up? He's right next to me! He can hear you!
Ugh! Now there's some sort of Puss! Just look!

See? Isn't that the most disgusting thing you've ever seen?
You think that just because you're whispering he can't hear what you are saying? He's two feet away from us! He can hear this entire conversation! He can hear me talking... right now!
Don't worry about it, he can't hear anything. Not with all that crust in his ear.

Is there... is there a problem, Officer... Palumbo?
Is there a problem? Have you heard of jaywalking?
Yes, I have. I'm really sorry. It won't happen again.
That's great. I'm writing you up a ticket.
A ticket? Are you serious?
Who the fuck are you, shitwad?
Harold: Thanks, for helping us out.

...Oh no problem at all, I seen you two stranded out there. Alone. In the darkness.
I said to myself.

What would Jesus do?

Goin' down to Georgia, gonna get myself baptised, gonna get myself baptised In the puddle of the looooooorrd.
$220? Are you crazy? Excuse me, Officer sir! Let me just take a few guesses here!
I'm really sorry for this...
No sudden movements! Back it up!
You were probably the big asshole in high school, right?
Absolutely right.
And you used to pick on guys like us everyday for fun?
With pleasure.
But then graduation day came! We went to college, while you went nowhere. And then you began to think to yourself, ""Gee. How can I still give them grief? Oh, I know, I'll just become a cop."" Yeah? Well, congratulations! Your dream has come true! Now, why don't you just take this quiet little Asian guy with the American name that treats you so well and give him some more tickets or better just take him to jail.
Even better.
You're going downtown thanks to your friend here.
Oh, great American name, Harold!
Yaaah!
Huh.
Oh, shoot.
I want 30 sliders, 5 french fries, and 4 large cherry cokes.
I want the same except make mine diet cokes.
Hey Roldy?
What?
There's something I forgot to tell you.
What?
I never hang-glided before.
WHAT?

Ah! AH! What the hell are you doing?
You've been out cold for the past half hour, I figured if I did some gay shit you'd wake up.
I apologize for my friend here, we had a really tough night. I'm really glad you're here. You ever heard of the show, Doogie Houser, MD?
Yeah, I know the show. God, I love that show! Doogie. Ha.
Neil Patrick Harris stole my car tonight.
Hey! NPH wouldn't do that, all right? Now let me see some I.D.
So what are you in for?
For being Black.
Seriously.
I am being serious. You wanna know what happened? I was walking out of a Barnes & Nobles, and a cop stops me. Evidently, a Black guy robbed a store in Newark. I told him, ""I haven't even been to Newark in months."" So, he starts beating with his gun, telling me to stop resisting arrest.
Holy shit! What did you do?
I said, "" I understand that I am under arrest. Now please stop beating me.""
I don't understand how you can be so calm about this.
Look at me. I'm fat, Black, can't dance and have tow gay fathers. People have been messing with me my whole life. I learned a long time ago there's no sense in getting all riled up every time a bunch of idiots give you a hard time. In the end, the universe tends to unfold as it should. Plus, I have a really large penis. That keeps me happy.
What the fuck is going on here? 2:... Never mind me. What the fuck are you doing here?
I thought you and J.D. were busy all night with clients. Isn't that why I had to do your work?
Henry, what the hell's going on?
Back off, cock boy.What I said to him goes double for you.
Did you just call me cock boy?
Yeah, you know I did. You're just stalling because you're not quick enough to think of a comeback.
You think I'm not quick enough. Guy thinks I'm not quick enough. Well, I've got news for you. I am quick enough... cock boy!
Listen, Harold, I'm really sorry.
Don't bother with him. We'll take it up with Berenson tomorrow.
What are you gonna tell Berenson? That I'm your workhorse? That you guys think you can party all weekend,
leave the work to the quiet Asian guy in the office?
No, you don't understand.
No, you don't understand.
I'm not doing your work for you anymore.
And if either one of you douche bags, ever tries to pull this shit again, I'll go to Berenson myself.
I'll tell him what's really going on. And I'll tell the whole office. how you both caught gonorrhea from that prostitute in Atlantic City.
If you'll excuse me, boys, I gotta get going. Kumar.
See you boys at the office on Monday.
Excuse me.
Sure got a lotta baggage."
Dale Denton,"BJ, BI","Stoner, Slacker","Let's roll, man! I'm done with the woods! Let's go! C'mon, man, let's get the fuck outta here!
Okay... Uhh let's go... No... It's not working... the battery's dead.
Wait...! What do you mean, it's dead?
What do I mean? I mean the battery's dead. The battery's dead!
No, no! What do you mean, the battery's dead?
How can I explain this to you differently? The battery is dead. It ceased to live. It's deceased now. The car needs a battery to start, Saul.
How did this happen?
Well we clearly fell asleep with the battery on and-...
Aw, man... Talk radio?
Yes, talk radio.
So boring, man! The car just committed suicide.
Man, I'm just into Buddhism, and I'm at peace with the fact that me, as this person, probably gonna not be around. Think about a hermit crab, okay? And it's a shell. It's like, they go from one shell to the next. And that's what I am. I'm just a hermit crab changin' shells.
Except if you're a dick your whole life, your next shell will be made of shit, okay? If you're an asshole, you're gonna come back as a cockroach or a worm or a fuckin' anal bead, okay? If you're a man and you act heroic, you'll come back as an eagle. You'll come back as a dragon. You'll come back as Jude Law, okay? Which would you rather be?
Maybe the anal bead, depending on who it belongs to.
Belongs to me.
Then the dragon.
I'm trying to decide how stoned I am and just how on the verge of death am I right now. Like, am I seeing shit because I'm stone or because I have no blood left in my body.
Well, you've been shot like seven times.
Why don't you follow his lead and just chill out, man?
I'm chill. I'm chill as a cucumber, man.
You don't seem chill.
I'm more chill than you.
You're more chill than me?
Yeah.
Look what I'm wearing. Kimono, dog. What're you wearing?
A suit.
Yeah, exactly. I don't know what's up with you, but I don't know if I like you.
Well, I don't know if I like you either, man.
Well, that's your loss 'cause I'm a great friend.
I wish I had a job like that. Where I could just sit around and smoke weed all day
Hey you do have that job. You do sit around and smoke weed all day.
Hey you're right. Hey thanks man.
BFFF?
Best Fuckin' Friends Forever, man!
This is like if that Blue Oyster shit met that Afghan Kush I had - and they had a baby. And then, meanwhile, that crazy Northern Light stuff I had and the Super Red Espresso Snowflake met and had a baby. And by some miracle, those two babies met and fucked - this would the shit that they birthed.
Wow. This is the product of baby fucking.
How about in the park, when I said you were my friend... you didn't say anything back.
Well, that's easy. It's because we're not friends. You are my drug dealer. The only reason I know you is because I like the drugs you sell. If you didn't sell drugs, I would have no idea who you are, and I wouldn't be here right now. I would be fantastic!
Oh.
I'm sorry, that sounded really mean... just to hear that, that sounded really mean.
No, I see. The monkey's out of the bottle now!
What? That's not even... a figure of speech.
Pandora can't go back into the box - he only comes out.
I go visit her in high school and all the guys she goes to school with are, like, strong and handsome and really, like, funny and do good impressions of Jeff Goldblum and shit like that. And, like, I just feel like a fat, dumb fuckin' stinky-ass turd when I'm there.
What?
It sucks for my ego.
Fuck Jeff Goldblum, man!
Even if he found that roach, how could he find us?
Um... heat-seeking missiles... bloodhounds... and foxes... barracudas...
I'm just - I'm kind of flabbergasted when you say things like that. It's weird.
Thank you.
Not a compliment.
Couscous - the food's so nice they named it twice.
Fuck you, Dale. I lost my virginity when I was fourteen, okay? How many women have you even slept with?
Like two and a half.
Two and a half? What is a half, your hand? That doesn't count!
What's up with the suit?
Oh, I'm a process server, so I have to wear a suit.
Wow, you're a servant? Like a butler? A chauffeur?
No, no. What? No, I'm not like-...
Shine shoes?
I'm a *process server*!
Do you know what today is?
Tuesday.
This is my cat's birthday today.
I don't see a cat in here. I'm sorry. Did you let it out by accident?
No, because he died three months ago, okay? So now who's the funny guy?
I'm sorry?
Today is his birthday and it is a tradition that on his birthday I get up extra early and make him his favorite kind of dessert.
Don't worry, bro. Your cat's going to heaven.
Yeah, maybe. Maybe he went to heaven. He was a little fucker. He could've gone to hell.
In case you haven't noticed - which you haven't, 'cause from what I can tell, you don't notice anything ever - we are not very functional when we're high.
Well, I don't know, man. I think I'm functioning right now. I was, like, stoned when I saved you with those slushies. What do you gotta say to that?
Well, that would be true if you had saved me. But you didn't save me. She was gonna help us, but you made things worse. Now we're wanted for all sorts of crazy shit!
Don't fucking get on my case, all right? Look, only reason I started selling pot is so I could put my bubbeh in a nice retirement home.
Oh, yeah, she must be proud of you for that.
She is really proud of me, and I'm gonna become something, man! As soon as she dies, I'm gonna become a civil engineer. I'm gonna design septic tanks for playgrounds. Little kids can take shits! You idiot, what the hell do you do?
Hey, look: it's like my thumb is my cock.
That's not gonna get us a ride, man.
You assholes do exactly as I say, or I will take you outside and fuck you in the street!
No! Don't fuck us anywhere!
I think we should stay!
Why?
...Cause I'm in the dumpster already!
What the fuck is this thing?
Ah. Cross joint.
Yeah.
You ever smoke one of those?
You can SMOKE this?
Hell yeah, man!
No.
This. Is. The future, this is like the apex of the vortex of joint engineering. It's rumored that M. M. O'Shaughnessy designed the first one - the guy who, uh, designed the Golden Gate Bridge. My second favorite civil engineer behind Hannskarl Bandel: Madison Square Garden... What you do is you light all three ends at the same time...
Really?
and then the smoke converges, creating a TRIFECTA of joint-smoking power. This is it, man. This is what your grandchildren are gonna be smoking. Future. That - future...
You don't think I can handle danger?
What are you talking about?
You can.
I totally can. And for you to come into my house and not tell secrets because you think you're saving me, well, in reality it just makes you look like a dumbass, cause look at this.
You see this? You see that? There's no hair under here, bro.
What's the significance of that?
It makes me aerodynamic when I fight. I can take danger.
I'm gonna get us out of here!
No, you're not. But it's okay.
Just sit back and get ready to enjoy some of the rarest weed known to mankind.
It's really that rare?
It's, like, the rarest.
It's almost a shame to smoke it. It's like killing a unicorn... with, like, a bomb.
Man, why'd we have to go to the woods?
Well you didn't come up with any ideas!
Yeah, I came up with two! Nowhere and Quizno's.
Hey, man, what happened to your lip?
Yeah... it looks like you've been crying or something...
Um, actually, my lip, that's a cold sore. And I've never had a cold sore before, so I cried.
Dude, a cold sore? Does that mean like... herpes?
Yes, that's what it means. I have herpes.
Herpes... Whoa, do you know how many, like, joints we've shared?
Yes, I know, I'm a disgusting person.
Hello? Hey, man.
What the fuck? I didn't buzz you in. How the monkey did you get in here?
Oh, shit, some guy with a faux 'hawk let me in. He was leaving when I was-...
Fuckin' Kyle, man?
It might've been Kyle.
That asshole.
I'm sorry.
What the fuck's the buzzer for, anyway?
I don't know. I'm sorry about that. I don't know your protocol yet.
Clark's a great guy, man. He's totally gonna take care of Angie, man. He's great; he's a wonderful lab partner, so... It's gonna be cool, he'll keep one eye on her.
Why don't you go fuck yourself, you weird little prick?
I'm a teacher, okay? You can't talk to me like that, guy.
I'm not a student, so I can say whatever the fuck I want, you chimp-fucking little bastard.
He fucking killed him!
Who killed who?
A cop, a lady, and a guy!
A cop, a lady, and a guy, man? That's like a massacre. You saw it?
No, it was just a guy!
What happened to the lady?
You killed my ear!
You shot me!
I didn't do that!
HE shot me!
You shot him?
nods his head
Get your hands off me!
Shut up! we've had enough of you!
I'm not your friend!
Danger! Danger! Trees! Tree! Tree! Squirrel!
I'm cold...
You're cold? Oh, I'm not cold at all. Here...
... I run hot.
Really?
Yeah.
You got more...
Thick blood.
...body.
It's time to suck today's dick!
Yeah, suck dick!
Saul, help me! Help me! He's punching my bum!
No, don't don't let him gonna... No, don't wanna.
Are you high?
What? No!
You are high as a fucking kite!
Oh, wow, you got a cute picture.
Oh, yeah, me and my bubbeh. Hey, let me ask you something. Do you think you could pull the plug on someone if you needed to? Like euthanasia?
Like on her?
If I needed to.
Um... I'm kind of in a hurry, man. I don't know if we should start going down that road. I could talk all day about euthanasia. Don't get me started.
Well, save it!
We'll save it for next time. We'll keep it going.
Hey, what's up, dudes?
What's up? Tell us everything now!
Talk, Red.
I'm gonna flex and bust out of here.
Trapped.
It's not happening, Red.
Okay, I'll talk. Um, Ted Jones, he knows you witnessed the murder. He found your roach. He sent two guys over here, Budlofsky and Matheson. Two real big son of a bitches. They're basically out to kill you guys, and they're gonna kill me, too, unless I turn y'all over. So you guys are basically fucked.
I'm like the nerd at the sleepover who fell asleep at nine.
It's okay. We won't put our dicks in your mouth.
Relax, man, just sit back and get ready to enjoy some of the rarest weed known to man.
It's really that rare?
It's like the rarest. It's almost a shame to smoke it. It's like... killin' a unicorn... with, like, a bomb...
Are you the only guy in town who has this? You're actually the only guy?
Yeah. My guy Red said he was givin' me an exclusive sneak preview.
And am I the only guy who you sold it to; the other guys got snicklefritz?
Yeah. So *we're* like the only guys...
And Red got this from Ted?
Ted's the man.
...Let's get the fuck outta here, man! Go! Go! Let's go!
What?
Let's go! Go!
Why?
Because! I threw a roach of this outside of Ted's house!
So what, man? I throw roaches all over the fuckin' town...
No! No, no! He could find the roach and say it's Pineapple Express in here! SAUL! He's the only guy who HAS Pineapple Express! He must've seen the murder or know - let's fuckin' kill him!
Oh, fuck!
Let's get outta here! Wait, wait, stop, stop, stop, stop! Get weed! Get the weed!
Okay.
Anything we might need: snacks, food, fruit roll-ups! Let's get the fuck outta here!
You know, don't get down on yourself: You got a great girl, you got a great job whete you don't go anything, you get to smoke weed all day... I wish I had that...
Are you kidd - you do, you have the easiest job on Earth. You DO smoke weed all day.
...Hahaha, that's true!
You didn't think of that, huh?
I do have a good job...
Yeah, you do nothing!
Thanks, man!
No problem.
Thank you.
Whoa! What the fuck was that?
I was trying to hit that tree. I missed.
What tree?
That one.
Why didn't you smash it on a rock like a normal person like I did?
I don't know! How often does somebody smash things? I'm rusty, fuck.
Oh, man, did you at least see where it landed?
I don't know. Just call it.
Call it? With what? My phone has been smashed!
Y'know, I bet they can't even triangulate those things.
Well, you shouldn't have said anything, because now you convinced me they can! You were very convincing back there!
Okay, okay. Fine, I'll go find it. Fuck.
Do you see it?
See what?
The phone, you idiot!
I'm here to save my best friend... I've got an idea! Rub your wrists against my belt buckle!
I'm gonna save you, man!
Yeah! Yeah!
Let me save you!
Smell it. SMELL it! Enjoy. It's like... God's vagina!
Uhhh!
What, do you wanna bathe in it?
I just want to live in here!
Yes, you wanna be it?
Oh, my God, I just wanna shove it up my nose and have that smell all day. That's amazing! It's beautiful!
Shove it anywhere you like!
What's it called?
Pineapple Express.
Don't move; this shit hurts!
What's in your hand?
It's weed, it's a joint, it's a roach. I thought it was decriminalized. To be honest with you, I have horrible anorexia and it helps my appetite. I'm so sorry.
Look, selling narcotics to my students is not decriminalized. I'm the liaison officer for this school. And guess what? I just saw three students walking from back here with their eyes as red as the devil's dick!
Fuck!
You're busted!
Those kids came up and they peer-pressured me; this is a horrible misunderstanding.
Yeah I know where he lives, what are you insinuating, that I'm forgetful?
Insinuating...
Yeah you know what that means? It means like...
I do what that means actually.
...to seem like.
How's it goin', sporty spice?
Okay here's what you do. You equip yourself...
I'm equipping! Equip me, sir!
See, Dale here, is a... protest servant, and...
No, I'm not. That's not who I am.
Holy cock!
Fuck you!
You were cold and I *clothed* you.
Gimme that fire extinguisher!
Do you believe me?
I don't know. Give me a minute. It was a woman or a man cop?
It was a policewoman. It was a woman.
Oh, I think I know who that bitch was.
Yes, I will identify that bitch!
I can't do this. I'm sorry, man. I can't do this. I'm infected. My shit's all fucked up. I need medical attention.
What do you mean you can't - I thought we just got all pumped up! What was that all about?
Dude, Ted is a fucking murderer! I can't fuck with him! I got a wife, man! She's gonna be out of jail soon. I wanna fuck her! I wanna have sex with her! I am not gonna wake up murdered tomorrow.
Oh, no! Come on, this could be your moment of redemption!
Fuck that. This'll be your moment.
What an adorable little cop.
I should call Angie soon... Make up some bullshit...
Aren't you angry at Ted?
Yeah, I'm really mad at him...
Well whaddya wanna do about it? Don't you wanna get up and DO SOMETHIN' about it?
Maybe... Maybe that'd be cool to do to him...
Oh, sick! You threw up on my printer!
I did.
You break it?
I hope not.
Give it to me!
Come on!
Be taller!
Be stronger!
Uh, I'm looking for someone more mature.
*Mature?* I lost my virginity when I was fourteen; how many women have *you* slept with?
Um, two and a half.
*A half?* What's *a half,* your hand?
Angie, I swear, you do something or I'm gonna...
What? No! No, don't let him gonna! No, don't wanna!
Where you think you're goin', Mr. Wiggles? Get back here! Feisty!
Saul, help! He's punching my bum! He's punching my bum! I'm done with this!
No, you're not. No, you're not!
Let's try words! Use WORDS!
Holy cock!
Fuck you!
Hey, in here!
What? WHOA! I gotta get to a phone, man, COME ON!
Why?
Why? Why, look! OK, if Red tells Ted's guys about
my name, They'll go to my apartment,
And there, I have Angie's name!
And they could put that all together, and they'll find us, Let's go!
No, no. I think we should stay.
WHY?
'Cause I'm in the dumpster already!
Well, then get out!
Ughh!
No, what are you do - Don't get a gun! Why would he bear arms?
Get the FUCK out of my car, I can't believe you'd even think that would be an option.
We gotta get away from the bad guys!
No, no, he's right. Come on, let's go.
The hell?
What the hell happened to you?
Nothing, I'm supposed to be here right now, so I'm here!
You're all dirty and bleeding.
No I'm not, I'm here for dinner.
You have scratches on your forehead...
Dude, you smell like shit.
Dale, what happened to you?
I was in the woods!
In the woods?
Yeah, isn't that weird? I was... I was in the woods!
What were you doing in the woods?
I bird... watch... I don't. No, I don't. Look, I'm gonna come clean. I witnessed a murder. Ok? I saw someone murder... someone else.
Come on, don't say that. I just can't go. I have a job, okay?
Fine.
""Fine""?
Don't come. I don't care.
If you don't care, then why have you invited me this whole time? I thought you wanted me to go.
Because if you don't wanna meet them, I don't want you to meet them.
I want to meet them. I just can't. I'm sorry, I have a job. What do you want from me?
I just know they'll like you, that's all. You're great, and you're funny... and you're sexy. I just want them to see that.
You want them to see that I'm sexy?
My God, are you okay?
I'm good, I'm fine, I'm great. Are you okay?
Yes, I'm fine.
Okay, good. I came up with a plan. Okay, it might sound weird at first, but just listen.
Dale! You know what? Drug dealers... Let me just say something. Drug dealers are trying to kill me. And you. And my family. I can't believe I'm in this situation right now because of you... and your addiction to marijuana. I cannot believe I'm here.
Let's roll, man! I'm done with the woods! Let's go! C'mon, man, let's get the fuck outta here!
Okay... Uhh let's go... No... It's not working... the battery's dead.
Wait...! What do you mean, it's dead?
What do I mean? I mean the battery's dead. The battery's dead!
No, no! What do you mean, the battery's dead?
How can I explain this to you differently? The battery is dead. It ceased to live. It's deceased now. The car needs a battery to start, Saul.
How did this happen?
Well we clearly fell asleep with the battery on and-...
Aw, man... Talk radio?
Yes, talk radio.
So boring, man! The car just committed suicide.
Man, I'm just into Buddhism, and I'm at peace with the fact that me, as this person, probably gonna not be around. Think about a hermit crab, okay? And it's a shell. It's like, they go from one shell to the next. And that's what I am. I'm just a hermit crab changin' shells.
Except if you're a dick your whole life, your next shell will be made of shit, okay? If you're an asshole, you're gonna come back as a cockroach or a worm or a fuckin' anal bead, okay? If you're a man and you act heroic, you'll come back as an eagle. You'll come back as a dragon. You'll come back as Jude Law, okay? Which would you rather be?
Maybe the anal bead, depending on who it belongs to.
Belongs to me.
Then the dragon.
I'm trying to decide how stoned I am and just how on the verge of death am I right now. Like, am I seeing shit because I'm stone or because I have no blood left in my body.
Well, you've been shot like seven times.
Why don't you follow his lead and just chill out, man?
I'm chill. I'm chill as a cucumber, man.
You don't seem chill.
I'm more chill than you.
You're more chill than me?
Yeah.
Look what I'm wearing. Kimono, dog. What're you wearing?
A suit.
Yeah, exactly. I don't know what's up with you, but I don't know if I like you.
Well, I don't know if I like you either, man.
Well, that's your loss 'cause I'm a great friend.
I wish I had a job like that. Where I could just sit around and smoke weed all day
Hey you do have that job. You do sit around and smoke weed all day.

I go visit her in high school and all the guys she goes to school with are, like, strong and handsome and really, like, funny and do good impressions of Jeff Goldblum and shit like that. And, like, I just feel like a fat, dumb fuckin' stinky-ass turd when I'm there.
What?
It sucks for my ego.
Fuck Jeff Goldblum, man!
Even if he found that roach, how could he find us?
Um... heat-seeking missiles... bloodhounds... and foxes... barracudas...
I'm just - I'm kind of flabbergasted when you say things like that. It's weird.

That's not gonna get us a ride, man.
You assholes do exactly as I say, or I will take you outside and fuck you in the street!
No! Don't fuck us anywhere!
I think we should stay!
Why?
...Cause I'm in the dumpster already!
What the fuck is this thing?
Ah. Cross joint.
Yeah.
You ever smoke one of those?
You can SMOKE this?
Hell yeah, man!
No.
This. Is. The future, this is like the apex of the vortex of joint engineering. It's rumored that M. M. O'Shaughnessy designed the first one - the guy who, uh, designed the Golden Gate Bridge. My second favorite civil engineer behind Hannskarl Bandel: Madison Square Garden... What you do is you light all three ends at the same time...
Really?
and then the smoke converges, creating a TRIFECTA of joint-smoking power. This is it, man. This is what your grandchildren are gonna be smoking. Future. That - future...
You don't think I can handle danger?
What are you talking about?
You can.
I totally can. And for you to come into my house and not tell secrets because you think you're saving me, well, in reality it just makes you look like a dumbass, cause look at this.
You see this? You see that? There's no hair under here, bro.
What's the significance of that?
It makes me aerodynamic when I fight. I can take danger.
I'm gonna get us out of here!
No, you're not. But it's okay.
Just sit back and get ready to enjoy some of the rarest weed known to mankind.
It's really that rare?
It's, like, the rarest.
It's almost a shame to smoke it. It's like killing a unicorn... with, like, a bomb.
Man, why'd we have to go to the woods?
Well you didn't come up with any ideas!
Yeah, I came up with two! Nowhere and Quizno's.
Hey, man, what happened to your lip?
Yeah... it looks like you've been crying or something...
Um, actually, my lip, that's a cold sore. And I've never had a cold sore before, so I cried.
Dude, a cold sore? Does that mean like... herpes?
Yes, that's what it means. I have herpes.
Herpes... Whoa, do you know how many, like, joints we've shared?
Yes, I know, I'm a disgusting person.
Hello? Hey, man.
What the fuck? I didn't buzz you in. How the monkey did you get in here?
Oh, shit, some guy with a faux 'hawk let me in. He was leaving when I was-...
Fuckin' Kyle, man?
It might've been Kyle.
That asshole.
I'm sorry.
What the fuck's the buzzer for, anyway?
I don't know. I'm sorry about that. I don't know your protocol yet.
Clark's a great guy, man. He's totally gonna take care of Angie, man. He's great; he's a wonderful lab partner, so... It's gonna be cool, he'll keep one eye on her.
Why don't you go fuck yourself, you weird little prick?
I'm a teacher, okay? You can't talk to me like that, guy.
I'm not a student, so I can say whatever the fuck I want, you chimp-fucking little bastard.
He fucking killed him!
Who killed who?
A cop, a lady, and a guy!
A cop, a lady, and a guy, man? That's like a massacre. You saw it?
No, it was just a guy!
What happened to the lady?
You killed my ear!
You shot me!
I didn't do that!
HE shot me!
You shot him?
nods his head
Get your hands off me!
Shut up! we've had enough of you!
I'm not your friend!
Danger! Danger! Trees! Tree! Tree! Squirrel!
I'm cold...
You're cold? Oh, I'm not cold at all. Here...
... I run hot.
Really?
Yeah.
You got more...
Thick blood.
...body.
It's time to suck today's dick!
Yeah, suck dick!
Saul, help me! Help me! He's punching my bum!
No, don't don't let him gonna... No, don't wanna.
Are you high?
What? No!
You are high as a fucking kite!
Oh, wow, you got a cute picture.
Oh, yeah, me and my bubbeh. Hey, let me ask you something. Do you think you could pull the plug on someone if you needed to? Like euthanasia?
Like on her?
If I needed to.
Um... I'm kind of in a hurry, man. I don't know if we should start going down that road. I could talk all day about euthanasia. Don't get me started.
Well, save it!
We'll save it for next time. We'll keep it going.
Hey, what's up, dudes?
What's up? Tell us everything now!
Talk, Red.
I'm gonna flex and bust out of here.
Trapped.
It's not happening, Red.
Okay, I'll talk. Um, Ted Jones, he knows you witnessed the murder. He found your roach. He sent two guys over here, Budlofsky and Matheson. Two real big son of a bitches. They're basically out to kill you guys, and they're gonna kill me, too, unless I turn y'all over. So you guys are basically fucked.
I'm like the nerd at the sleepover who fell asleep at nine.
It's okay. We won't put our dicks in your mouth.
Relax, man, just sit back and get ready to enjoy some of the rarest weed known to man.
It's really that rare?
It's like the rarest. It's almost a shame to smoke it. It's like... killin' a unicorn... with, like, a bomb...
Are you the only guy in town who has this? You're actually the only guy?
Yeah. My guy Red said he was givin' me an exclusive sneak preview.
And am I the only guy who you sold it to; the other guys got snicklefritz?
Yeah. So *we're* like the only guys...
And Red got this from Ted?
Ted's the man.
...Let's get the fuck outta here, man! Go! Go! Let's go!
What?
Let's go! Go!
Why?
Because! I threw a roach of this outside of Ted's house!
So what, man? I throw roaches all over the fuckin' town...
No! No, no! He could find the roach and say it's Pineapple Express in here! SAUL! He's the only guy who HAS Pineapple Express! He must've seen the murder or know - let's fuckin' kill him!
Oh, fuck!
Let's get outta here! Wait, wait, stop, stop, stop, stop! Get weed! Get the weed!
Okay.
Anything we might need: snacks, food, fruit roll-ups! Let's get the fuck outta here!
You know, don't get down on yourself: You got a great girl, you got a great job whete you don't go anything, you get to smoke weed all day... I wish I had that...
Are you kidd - you do, you have the easiest job on Earth. You DO smoke weed all day.
...Hahaha, that's true!
You didn't think of that, huh?
I do have a good job...
Yeah, you do nothing!
Thanks, man!
No problem.
Thank you.
Whoa! What the fuck was that?
I was trying to hit that tree. I missed.
What tree?
That one.
Why didn't you smash it on a rock like a normal person like I did?
I don't know! How often does somebody smash things? I'm rusty, fuck.
Oh, man, did you at least see where it landed?
I don't know. Just call it.
Call it? With what? My phone has been smashed!
Y'know, I bet they can't even triangulate those things.
Well, you shouldn't have said anything, because now you convinced me they can! You were very convincing back there!
Okay, okay. Fine, I'll go find it. Fuck.
Do you see it?
See what?
The phone, you idiot!
I'm here to save my best friend... I've got an idea! Rub your wrists against my belt buckle!
I'm gonna save you, man!
Yeah! Yeah!
Let me save you!
Smell it. SMELL it! Enjoy. It's like... God's vagina!
Uhhh!
What, do you wanna bathe in it?
I just want to live in here!
Yes, you wanna be it?
Oh, my God, I just wanna shove it up my nose and have that smell all day. That's amazing! It's beautiful!
Shove it anywhere you like!
What's it called?
Pineapple Express.
Don't move; this shit hurts!
What's in your hand?
It's weed, it's a joint, it's a roach. I thought it was decriminalized. To be honest with you, I have horrible anorexia and it helps my appetite. I'm so sorry.
Look, selling narcotics to my students is not decriminalized. I'm the liaison officer for this school. And guess what? I just saw three students walking from back here with their eyes as red as the devil's dick!
Fuck!
You're busted!
Those kids came up and they peer-pressured me; this is a horrible misunderstanding.
Yeah I know where he lives, what are you insinuating, that I'm forgetful?
Insinuating...
Yeah you know what that means? It means like...
I do what that means actually.
...to seem like.
How's it goin', sporty spice?
Okay here's what you do. You equip yourself...
I'm equipping! Equip me, sir!
See, Dale here, is a... protest servant, and...
No, I'm not. That's not who I am.
Holy cock!
Fuck you!
You were cold and I *clothed* you.
Gimme that fire extinguisher!
Do you believe me?
I don't know. Give me a minute. It was a woman or a man cop?
It was a policewoman. It was a woman.
Oh, I think I know who that bitch was.
Yes, I will identify that bitch!
I can't do this. I'm sorry, man. I can't do this. I'm infected. My shit's all fucked up. I need medical attention.
What do you mean you can't - I thought we just got all pumped up! What was that all about?
Dude, Ted is a fucking murderer! I can't fuck with him! I got a wife, man! She's gonna be out of jail soon. I wanna fuck her! I wanna have sex with her! I am not gonna wake up murdered tomorrow.
Oh, no! Come on, this could be your moment of redemption!
Fuck that. This'll be your moment.
What an adorable little cop.
I should call Angie soon... Make up some bullshit...
Aren't you angry at Ted?
Yeah, I'm really mad at him...
Well whaddya wanna do about it? Don't you wanna get up and DO SOMETHIN' about it?
Maybe... Maybe that'd be cool to do to him...
Oh, sick! You threw up on my printer!
I did.
You break it?
I hope not.
Give it to me!
Come on!
Be taller!
Be stronger!
Uh, I'm looking for someone more mature.
*Mature?* I lost my virginity when I was fourteen; how many women have *you* slept with?
Um, two and a half.
*A half?* What's *a half,* your hand?
Angie, I swear, you do something or I'm gonna...
What? No! No, don't let him gonna! No, don't wanna!
Where you think you're goin', Mr. Wiggles? Get back here! Feisty!
Saul, help! He's punching my bum! He's punching my bum! I'm done with this!
No, you're not. No, you're not!
Let's try words! Use WORDS!
Holy cock!
Fuck you!
Hey, in here!
What? WHOA! I gotta get to a phone, man, COME ON!
Why?
Why? Why, look! OK, if Red tells Ted's guys about
my name, They'll go to my apartment,
And there, I have Angie's name!
And they could put that all together, and they'll find us, Let's go!
No, no. I think we should stay.
WHY?
'Cause I'm in the dumpster already!
Well, then get out!
Ughh!
No, what are you do - Don't get a gun! Why would he bear arms?
Get the FUCK out of my car, I can't believe you'd even think that would be an option.
We gotta get away from the bad guys!
No, no, he's right. Come on, let's go.
The hell?
What the hell happened to you?
Nothing, I'm supposed to be here right now, so I'm here!
You're all dirty and bleeding.
No I'm not, I'm here for dinner.
You have scratches on your forehead...
Dude, you smell like shit.
Dale, what happened to you?
I was in the woods!
In the woods?
Yeah, isn't that weird? I was... I was in the woods!
What were you doing in the woods?
I bird... watch... I don't. No, I don't. Look, I'm gonna come clean. I witnessed a murder. Ok? I saw someone murder... someone else.
Come on, don't say that. I just can't go. I have a job, okay?
Fine.
""Fine""?
Don't come. I don't care.
If you don't care, then why have you invited me this whole time? I thought you wanted me to go.
Because if you don't wanna meet them, I don't want you to meet them.
I want to meet them. I just can't. I'm sorry, I have a job. What do you want from me?
I just know they'll like you, that's all. You're great, and you're funny... and you're sexy. I just want them to see that.
You want them to see that I'm sexy?
My God, are you okay?
I'm good, I'm fine, I'm great. Are you okay?
Yes, I'm fine.
Okay, good. I came up with a plan. Okay, it might sound weird at first, but just listen.
Dale! You know what? Drug dealers... Let me just say something. Drug dealers are trying to kill me. And you. And my family. I can't believe I'm in this situation right now because of you... and your addiction to marijuana. I cannot believe I'm here."
Red,BJ,Stoner,"Man, I'm just into Buddhism, and I'm at peace with the fact that me, as this person, probably gonna not be around. Think about a hermit crab, okay? And it's a shell. It's like, they go from one shell to the next. And that's what I am. I'm just a hermit crab changin' shells.
Except if you're a dick your whole life, your next shell will be made of shit, okay? If you're an asshole, you're gonna come back as a cockroach or a worm or a fuckin' anal bead, okay? If you're a man and you act heroic, you'll come back as an eagle. You'll come back as a dragon. You'll come back as Jude Law, okay? Which would you rather be?
Maybe the anal bead, depending on who it belongs to.
Belongs to me.
Then the dragon.
I'm trying to decide how stoned I am and just how on the verge of death am I right now. Like, am I seeing shit because I'm stone or because I have no blood left in my body.
Well, you've been shot like seven times.
Why don't you follow his lead and just chill out, man?
I'm chill. I'm chill as a cucumber, man.
You don't seem chill.
I'm more chill than you.
You're more chill than me?
Yeah.
Look what I'm wearing. Kimono, dog. What're you wearing?
A suit.
Yeah, exactly. I don't know what's up with you, but I don't know if I like you.
Well, I don't know if I like you either, man.
Well, that's your loss 'cause I'm a great friend.
You just got killed by a Daewoo Lanos, motherfucker!
I'm just up here, tryin' to get a motherfuckin' scholarship!
I used to use this little gun when I was a prostitute.
Do you know what today is?
Tuesday.
This is my cat's birthday today.
I don't see a cat in here. I'm sorry. Did you let it out by accident?
No, because he died three months ago, okay? So now who's the funny guy?
I'm sorry?
Today is his birthday and it is a tradition that on his birthday I get up extra early and make him his favorite kind of dessert.
Don't worry, bro. Your cat's going to heaven.
Yeah, maybe. Maybe he went to heaven. He was a little fucker. He could've gone to hell.
Thug life!
You don't think I can handle danger?
What are you talking about?
You can.
I totally can. And for you to come into my house and not tell secrets because you think you're saving me, well, in reality it just makes you look like a dumbass, cause look at this.
You see this? You see that? There's no hair under here, bro.
What's the significance of that?
It makes me aerodynamic when I fight. I can take danger.
Red, this is your last chance. You gonna give us something we can use?
Matheson, you gotta be kidding me, man. What more do you want? I told you the guy's name was Dale Denton. He's obviously working with Saul. They came in here, they busted my house to shit, they kicked the hell out of me, and then duct-taped me to my grandfather's wheelchair. What more do you want me to tell you? Want me to read your horoscope?
You hear that, Ted?
Okay, ask if either of them were Asian.
What skin color were they?
They were white people. Denton might've been a Jew. I don't know. I don't judge people based on things like that. Obviously, we're friends.
Ted, you hear him?
Dale Denton. Not Asian. All right, kill Red.
Man, listen, I would just appreciate it if both of y'all would take your shoes off. This is brand-new carpet. You're tracking mud in here. Matheson, you got British Knights on. I ain't seen anybody wear them since 1987-...
Hey, man, what happened to your lip?
Yeah... it looks like you've been crying or something...
Um, actually, my lip, that's a cold sore. And I've never had a cold sore before, so I cried.
Dude, a cold sore? Does that mean like... herpes?
Yes, that's what it means. I have herpes.
Herpes... Whoa, do you know how many, like, joints we've shared?
Yes, I know, I'm a disgusting person.
You lied to me.
I did. I lied big time to you.
Dale said that that you didn't even have herpes, and I said that you did.
Honestly, like, from now on, just, like, from everything that we've gone through, from, like, seeing this fuckin' asshole's nuts smashed with my Daewoo, I want to be a better friend to you. I really do.
I fuckin' love you, dog. I fuckin' love you.
I wanna be inside you, homes.
No more lies, Red.
This is my moment.
This is your moment.
I am not gonna wake up murdered tomorrow!
Hey, what's up, dudes?
What's up? Tell us everything now!
Talk, Red.
I'm gonna flex and bust out of here.
Trapped.
It's not happening, Red.
Okay, I'll talk. Um, Ted Jones, he knows you witnessed the murder. He found your roach. He sent two guys over here, Budlofsky and Matheson. Two real big son of a bitches. They're basically out to kill you guys, and they're gonna kill me, too, unless I turn y'all over. So you guys are basically fucked.
I'm like the nerd at the sleepover who fell asleep at nine.
It's okay. We won't put our dicks in your mouth.
You still got that bong I got you when I was in Tel Aviv?
Hell yeah, Bong Mitzvah! Hit it up, dude!
Herpes is for life, bro!
Yeah, well, I'm gonna try to definitely put some sort of medical ointment on it. I've been takin Vicodin; that really doesn't take down the swelling, though.
It's from that time. I told you, man! You wanted to eat that lollipop out of that stripper's snatch! You wanted to do it!
Out of her vagina, I know! Remember what you did? What'd you do?
Nothing.
You ate a box of Nerds outta her butt-hoooole.
Do not break down the door! Are you gonna pay for it?
TIME OUT! Time out!
Okay, truce.
Time in! Fuck you!
CHEATER!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
Today's my cat's birthday.
There you go. Why don't you just follow his lead and just chill out, man?
I can't do this. I'm sorry, man. I can't do this. I'm infected. My shit's all fucked up. I need medical attention.
What do you mean you can't - I thought we just got all pumped up! What was that all about?
Dude, Ted is a fucking murderer! I can't fuck with him! I got a wife, man! She's gonna be out of jail soon. I wanna fuck her! I wanna have sex with her! I am not gonna wake up murdered tomorrow.
Oh, no! Come on, this could be your moment of redemption!
Fuck that. This'll be your moment.
Aren't you angry at Ted?
Yeah, I'm really mad at him...
Well whaddya wanna do about it? Don't you wanna get up and DO SOMETHIN' about it?
Maybe... Maybe that'd be cool to do to him...
Where you think you're goin', Mr. Wiggles? Get back here! Feisty!
Saul, help! He's punching my bum! He's punching my bum! I'm done with this!
No, you're not. No, you're not!
Let's try words! Use WORDS!
You assholes, you ruined my portable phone!
HERPES!
You brought the devil into my house!
We're friends!
I know we are, that's what SUCKS!
Are you on that meth shit again?
Dale, he's hurting me!
Ted Jones messed with the wrong melon farmers.
What the fuck, man? You shot me in my stomach! I'm gon' die now probably! Man, I had y'all over for dinner - fish tacos! This how you do me?"
Saul Silver,BJ,Stoner,"Fuck the po-lice!
Let's roll, man! I'm done with the woods! Let's go! C'mon, man, let's get the fuck outta here!
Okay... Uhh let's go... No... It's not working... the battery's dead.
Wait...! What do you mean, it's dead?
What do I mean? I mean the battery's dead. The battery's dead!
No, no! What do you mean, the battery's dead?
How can I explain this to you differently? The battery is dead. It ceased to live. It's deceased now. The car needs a battery to start, Saul.
How did this happen?
Well we clearly fell asleep with the battery on and-...
Aw, man... Talk radio?
Yes, talk radio.
So boring, man! The car just committed suicide.
I wish I had a job like that. Where I could just sit around and smoke weed all day
Hey you do have that job. You do sit around and smoke weed all day.
Hey you're right. Hey thanks man.
BFFF?
Best Fuckin' Friends Forever, man!
It's almost a shame to smoke it. It's like killing a unicorn... with, like, a bomb.
This is like if that Blue Oyster shit met that Afghan Kush I had - and they had a baby. And then, meanwhile, that crazy Northern Light stuff I had and the Super Red Espresso Snowflake met and had a baby. And by some miracle, those two babies met and fucked - this would the shit that they birthed.
Wow. This is the product of baby fucking.
How about in the park, when I said you were my friend... you didn't say anything back.
Well, that's easy. It's because we're not friends. You are my drug dealer. The only reason I know you is because I like the drugs you sell. If you didn't sell drugs, I would have no idea who you are, and I wouldn't be here right now. I would be fantastic!
Oh.
I'm sorry, that sounded really mean... just to hear that, that sounded really mean.
No, I see. The monkey's out of the bottle now!
What? That's not even... a figure of speech.
Pandora can't go back into the box - he only comes out.
I go visit her in high school and all the guys she goes to school with are, like, strong and handsome and really, like, funny and do good impressions of Jeff Goldblum and shit like that. And, like, I just feel like a fat, dumb fuckin' stinky-ass turd when I'm there.
What?
It sucks for my ego.
Fuck Jeff Goldblum, man!
Enjoy your last meal.
Here, supersize it, bitch.
Even if he found that roach, how could he find us?
Um... heat-seeking missiles... bloodhounds... and foxes... barracudas...
I'm just - I'm kind of flabbergasted when you say things like that. It's weird.
Thank you.
Not a compliment.
What's down there, a fucking Rancor?
Holy cock!
There's a fly in the ointment, shits hittin' the fan, the lion will speak!
I thought hurricane season was over!
What's up with the suit?
Oh, I'm a process server, so I have to wear a suit.
Wow, you're a servant? Like a butler? A chauffeur?
No, no. What? No, I'm not like-...
Shine shoes?
I'm a *process server*!
Do you know what today is?
Tuesday.
This is my cat's birthday today.
I don't see a cat in here. I'm sorry. Did you let it out by accident?
No, because he died three months ago, okay? So now who's the funny guy?
I'm sorry?
Today is his birthday and it is a tradition that on his birthday I get up extra early and make him his favorite kind of dessert.
Don't worry, bro. Your cat's going to heaven.
Yeah, maybe. Maybe he went to heaven. He was a little fucker. He could've gone to hell.
In case you haven't noticed - which you haven't, 'cause from what I can tell, you don't notice anything ever - we are not very functional when we're high.
Well, I don't know, man. I think I'm functioning right now. I was, like, stoned when I saved you with those slushies. What do you gotta say to that?
Well, that would be true if you had saved me. But you didn't save me. She was gonna help us, but you made things worse. Now we're wanted for all sorts of crazy shit!
Don't fucking get on my case, all right? Look, only reason I started selling pot is so I could put my bubbeh in a nice retirement home.
Oh, yeah, she must be proud of you for that.
She is really proud of me, and I'm gonna become something, man! As soon as she dies, I'm gonna become a civil engineer. I'm gonna design septic tanks for playgrounds. Little kids can take shits! You idiot, what the hell do you do?
Hey, look: it's like my thumb is my cock.
That's not gonna get us a ride, man.
Well be careful, man. Be careful. Wear shoes in the house. Safety. Safety first, then teamwork.
I think we should stay!
Why?
...Cause I'm in the dumpster already!
What the fuck is this thing?
Ah. Cross joint.
Yeah.
You ever smoke one of those?
You can SMOKE this?
Hell yeah, man!
No.
This. Is. The future, this is like the apex of the vortex of joint engineering. It's rumored that M. M. O'Shaughnessy designed the first one - the guy who, uh, designed the Golden Gate Bridge. My second favorite civil engineer behind Hannskarl Bandel: Madison Square Garden... What you do is you light all three ends at the same time...
Really?
and then the smoke converges, creating a TRIFECTA of joint-smoking power. This is it, man. This is what your grandchildren are gonna be smoking. Future. That - future...
You don't think I can handle danger?
What are you talking about?
You can.
I totally can. And for you to come into my house and not tell secrets because you think you're saving me, well, in reality it just makes you look like a dumbass, cause look at this.
You see this? You see that? There's no hair under here, bro.
What's the significance of that?
It makes me aerodynamic when I fight. I can take danger.
I'm gonna get us out of here!
No, you're not. But it's okay.
When my foot was in the hole - and my groin - man, I felt like a wishbone.
Just sit back and get ready to enjoy some of the rarest weed known to mankind.
It's really that rare?
It's, like, the rarest.
It's almost a shame to smoke it. It's like killing a unicorn... with, like, a bomb.
You're in the jungle now, Baby!
You know you gonna die right?
Yeah...
I'm gonna kill the fuck out you... I hope you enjoy these last... 17 minutes of your life... cause when Ted gets here, he's gonna be like, 'Kill that motha fucker, kill that motha fuckin ass'... watch your head!
Man, why'd we have to go to the woods?
Well you didn't come up with any ideas!
Yeah, I came up with two! Nowhere and Quizno's.
Hey, man, what happened to your lip?
Yeah... it looks like you've been crying or something...
Um, actually, my lip, that's a cold sore. And I've never had a cold sore before, so I cried.
Dude, a cold sore? Does that mean like... herpes?
Yes, that's what it means. I have herpes.
Herpes... Whoa, do you know how many, like, joints we've shared?
Yes, I know, I'm a disgusting person.
Hello? Hey, man.
What the fuck? I didn't buzz you in. How the monkey did you get in here?
Oh, shit, some guy with a faux 'hawk let me in. He was leaving when I was-...
Fuckin' Kyle, man?
It might've been Kyle.
That asshole.
I'm sorry.
What the fuck's the buzzer for, anyway?
I don't know. I'm sorry about that. I don't know your protocol yet.
He fucking killed him!
Who killed who?
A cop, a lady, and a guy!
A cop, a lady, and a guy, man? That's like a massacre. You saw it?
No, it was just a guy!
What happened to the lady?
You lied to me.
I did. I lied big time to you.
Dale said that that you didn't even have herpes, and I said that you did.
Honestly, like, from now on, just, like, from everything that we've gone through, from, like, seeing this fuckin' asshole's nuts smashed with my Daewoo, I want to be a better friend to you. I really do.
I fuckin' love you, dog. I fuckin' love you.
I wanna be inside you, homes.
No more lies, Red.
This is my moment.
This is your moment.
You killed my ear!
You shot me!
I didn't do that!
HE shot me!
You shot him?
nods his head
Get your hands off me!
Shut up! we've had enough of you!
I'm not your friend!
I'm cold...
You're cold? Oh, I'm not cold at all. Here...
... I run hot.
Really?
Yeah.
You got more...
Thick blood.
...body.
A dude, a lady, and a cop? That like a massacre, man!
Oh, wow, you got a cute picture.
Oh, yeah, me and my bubbeh. Hey, let me ask you something. Do you think you could pull the plug on someone if you needed to? Like euthanasia?
Like on her?
If I needed to.
Um... I'm kind of in a hurry, man. I don't know if we should start going down that road. I could talk all day about euthanasia. Don't get me started.
Well, save it!
We'll save it for next time. We'll keep it going.
I wish we could just go nowhere.
Hey, what's up, dudes?
What's up? Tell us everything now!
Talk, Red.
I'm gonna flex and bust out of here.
Trapped.
It's not happening, Red.
Okay, I'll talk. Um, Ted Jones, he knows you witnessed the murder. He found your roach. He sent two guys over here, Budlofsky and Matheson. Two real big son of a bitches. They're basically out to kill you guys, and they're gonna kill me, too, unless I turn y'all over. So you guys are basically fucked.
You still got that bong I got you when I was in Tel Aviv?
Hell yeah, Bong Mitzvah! Hit it up, dude!
Relax, man, just sit back and get ready to enjoy some of the rarest weed known to man.
It's really that rare?
It's like the rarest. It's almost a shame to smoke it. It's like... killin' a unicorn... with, like, a bomb...
Are you the only guy in town who has this? You're actually the only guy?
Yeah. My guy Red said he was givin' me an exclusive sneak preview.
And am I the only guy who you sold it to; the other guys got snicklefritz?
Yeah. So *we're* like the only guys...
And Red got this from Ted?
Ted's the man.
...Let's get the fuck outta here, man! Go! Go! Let's go!
What?
Let's go! Go!
Why?
Because! I threw a roach of this outside of Ted's house!
So what, man? I throw roaches all over the fuckin' town...
No! No, no! He could find the roach and say it's Pineapple Express in here! SAUL! He's the only guy who HAS Pineapple Express! He must've seen the murder or know - let's fuckin' kill him!
Oh, fuck!
Let's get outta here! Wait, wait, stop, stop, stop, stop! Get weed! Get the weed!
Okay.
Anything we might need: snacks, food, fruit roll-ups! Let's get the fuck outta here!
You know, don't get down on yourself: You got a great girl, you got a great job whete you don't go anything, you get to smoke weed all day... I wish I had that...
Are you kidd - you do, you have the easiest job on Earth. You DO smoke weed all day.
...Hahaha, that's true!
You didn't think of that, huh?
I do have a good job...
Yeah, you do nothing!
Thanks, man!
No problem.
Thank you.
Herpes is for life, bro!
Yeah, well, I'm gonna try to definitely put some sort of medical ointment on it. I've been takin Vicodin; that really doesn't take down the swelling, though.
It's from that time. I told you, man! You wanted to eat that lollipop out of that stripper's snatch! You wanted to do it!
Out of her vagina, I know! Remember what you did? What'd you do?
Nothing.
You ate a box of Nerds outta her butt-hoooole.
Whoa! What the fuck was that?
I was trying to hit that tree. I missed.
What tree?
That one.
Why didn't you smash it on a rock like a normal person like I did?
I don't know! How often does somebody smash things? I'm rusty, fuck.
Oh, man, did you at least see where it landed?
I don't know. Just call it.
Call it? With what? My phone has been smashed!
Y'know, I bet they can't even triangulate those things.
Well, you shouldn't have said anything, because now you convinced me they can! You were very convincing back there!
Okay, okay. Fine, I'll go find it. Fuck.
Do you see it?
See what?
The phone, you idiot!
I'm here to save my best friend... I've got an idea! Rub your wrists against my belt buckle!
I'm gonna save you, man!
Yeah! Yeah!
Let me save you!
Smell it. SMELL it! Enjoy. It's like... God's vagina!
Uhhh!
What, do you wanna bathe in it?
I just want to live in here!
Yes, you wanna be it?
Oh, my God, I just wanna shove it up my nose and have that smell all day. That's amazing! It's beautiful!
Shove it anywhere you like!
What's it called?
Pineapple Express.
Yeah I know where he lives, what are you insinuating, that I'm forgetful?
Insinuating...
Yeah you know what that means? It means like...
I do what that means actually.
...to seem like.
Okay here's what you do. You equip yourself...
I'm equipping! Equip me, sir!
What you do... is you light all three ends at the same, and the smoke converges, creating a *trifecta* of joint-smoking power. This is it, man. This is what your grandchildren are gonna be smoking. Future, that future.
See, Dale here, is a... protest servant, and...
No, I'm not. That's not who I am.
TIME OUT! Time out!
Okay, truce.
Time in! Fuck you!
CHEATER!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
Holy cock!
Fuck you!
You know you gonna die, right?
Yeah.
I'm gonna kill the fuck out of you! I hope you enjoy these last seventeen minutes of your life.
Oh, sick! You threw up on my printer!
I did.
You break it?
I hope not.
Give it to me!
Come on!
Be taller!
Be stronger!
Stand back! Ted wants him alive!
Why're you holding me back?
Ted wants him alive, okay?
I should be kicking his fucking teeth in!
If anybody's gonna beat him up, it's gonna be Ted.
I look like Hamburglar! And the Elephant Man!
You look like someone fucked you up with a coffee pot, man!
Professional. Professional.
Professional on this, bitch!
Whatever, man.
And where were you?
I was there!
You're supposed to be my partner!
I was there!
No, you wasn't there! How did this happen, then?
He's got good reflexes, man.
Holy cock!
Fuck you!
I knew you were going soft. Dinner's gonna be cold tonight, asshole!
Fucked up, man.
Well looky here, Mr. Forges. Wussup, Saul?
Look, I didn't want to hit you, man...
SHUT THE FUCK UP! You think you was gonna get me, motherfucker? Huh? You need to set your little sexy ass down and watch yourself get killed now!
Alright! You know what, if this is how it's gonna be, alright. Silence!
Hey, in here!
What? WHOA! I gotta get to a phone, man, COME ON!
Why?
Why? Why, look! OK, if Red tells Ted's guys about
my name, They'll go to my apartment,
And there, I have Angie's name!
And they could put that all together, and they'll find us, Let's go!
No, no. I think we should stay.
WHY?
'Cause I'm in the dumpster already!
Well, then get out!
Ughh!
But don't call it that. Call it... Banana Boat.
If anyone asks, you got it from Sau - -I mean... Santiago and... Dunbar.
Get the FUCK out of my car, I can't believe you'd even think that would be an option.
We gotta get away from the bad guys!
No, no, he's right. Come on, let's go.
The hell?
HERPES!
You brought the devil into my house!
We're friends!
I know we are, that's what SUCKS!
Are you on that meth shit again?
Dale, he's hurting me!
What we do in this life echoes in eternity!"
Thadeous,BJ,Stoner,"Thaddeus, I have not been able to stop thinking of you.
What a coincidence. I was just about to finish thinking of you.
This quest sucks!
Courtney, will you make funny faces to entertain me?
No! Never triangle-face! I *hate* triangle face! It scares me!
I shouldn't even be here! I will probably die on this quest, Courtney definitely will!
What's your problem? Why are you being such a sourpuss?
I'm not being a sourpuss! I just didn't want to be at that celebration
All I want is for you to be a part of this moment. I want you to be gay with me and father.
I don't want to be gay with you two!
SHIT!
You have to suck out the venom!
I don't want to suck it, you suck it!
I can't suck my own venom!
Yes you can! I'll help you!
Suck it! Suck your venom!
I can't reach it with my mouth!
Courtney, suck the venom!
But I've never...
SUCK IT!
Stephen, I'm going to put you in the corner *now* while I strum my filthies.

Thank you, Wize Wizard.
Not so fast. First you must answer a riddle. What journey be long and twisted and sensitive at hand? To what end must man go to discover the depths of his ecstasy? Think hard strong warriors.
Fuck! I know this!
I got it! You want us to twist, what is long, with our sensitive hands?
He wants us to jerk him off!
Just touch the tip and twist it.
We are not going to do that.
If it's for the quest, we will do what needs to be done.
Yuck!
Thadeous, are you seeing what I'm seeing?
You making a fool of yourself. Handle your shit, Fabious, please.
It's my birthday today, you know.
Fuck that.
Maybe they're right, everything they say about you.
They only say that stuff because of you, because you go out and have to pretend to be the best, and they look at me like I'm some sort of idiot. Everyone in the kingdom wants to suck your dick, no one wants to suck mine!
Not so fast, trickster.
Hello, Thadeous.
The time for pleasantries is through; do you feel that tiny prick in your back?
Is that your cock?
Ha! It is a knife but I'll gladly penetrate you with it.
What right have you to spy on a bathing woman from these shrubs?
I'm simply keeping an eye on her. She is not like one of our dim witted chamber maids that let me take from behind. This woman has be vexed. What exactly would it take for one to tame such an adventurous slut?
Well, I imagine she'd want a man to be honorable, bold, brave. Know his way round a blade.
Oh, God! She's looking at us! Remain perfectly still.
My path has been unstable, but my conviction is born to damn the fuckers who doubted me. To lessen the assholes who tested me. To right what is wrong, to restore faith that has long been lost, and to rise to great heights even beyond my own legend as a Great Cocksmith, Master Pintsman, and stunningly handsome Prince of Light in these dark Dark Ages!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't suck that. That's dead.
What the fuck?
Only a champion man would hold the Blade of Unicorn in his hands. And I, Thadeous, am that man. I have seen the pain in my reflection and watched the strength of my brother, unflinching. My quest is one of love, but also in this moment of forgiveness, of redemption, even amongst the smallest of foes. My path has been unstable, but my conviction is born to damn those who doubted me. To lessen those who tested me. To right what is wrong. To restore faith that has long been lost. And to rise to great heights even beyond my own legend in these dark, Dark Ages. True trials await, and I will greet thee with the hammer of my fist and the slide of my sword. As the fog clears, I will follow the voice that guides me: My love, my heart, my Gods!
Well, it would be nice to be king.
Step back new friends, I'll lead the way, for tonight Evil's met its match.
Fantastic! Thank you again for coming.
Well, then things will get very nasty.
Oh really?
Oh, REALLY!"
Fabious,BJ,Stoner,"I'm here to steal a beautiful virgin that looks just. Like. Her.
And how do you plan to do that?
Magic.

Marty Mikalski,BJ,Stoner,"I'm so sorry I almost shot you... I probably wouldn't have.
Hey. Hey, no, shh, no. I totally get it.
I'm sorry I let you get attacked by a werewolf and then ended the world.
Statistical fact. Cops will never pull over a man with a huge bong in his car. Why? They fear this man. They know he sees further than they... and he will bind them... with ancient logics.
Yeah, I, uh, I had to dismember that guy with a trowel. What have you been up to?
Good work, zombie arm.
Okay, I'm drawing a line in the fucking sand, here. Do not read the Latin.
It was the pioneer days. People had to make their own interrogation rooms.
Okay, my turn! Jules!
Mmm?
Truth or dare?
Let's go dare.
All right. I dare you... to make out with...
Please say ""Dana,"" please say ""Dana,"" please say ""Dana.""
...that moose, over there.
Um, Marty? Have you ever seen a moose before?
Whatever that mysterious beast is.
That's a wolf.
That's clearly a wolf.
Giant evil gods.
I wish I could've seen them.
I know. That would have been a fun weekend.
Oh, my God. I'm on a reality TV show. My parents are gonna think I'm such a burnout.
We are not who we are.
I'm gonna go read a book with pictures.
Puppeteers...
Puppeteers?
Pop-Tarts? Did you say you have Pop-Tarts?
People in this town drive in a very counterintuitive manner.
And I think I can get it to go down.
Do we wanna go down?
He's got a husband's bulge.
I'm thinking this thing doesn't take credit cards.
I don't think it knows about money.
The whole world, Marty.
...Is in your hands, Dana. There is no other way. You have to be strong.
Yeah, Dana. You feeling strong?
Look. We gotta lock this place down.
He's right.
We'll go room by room. Barricade every window and door. We gotta play it safe. No matter what happens, we have to stay together.
Fuck!
Calm down. Watch the master work.
This isn't right.
What? What's the matter?
Th-This isn't right. We should split up. We-We can cover more ground that way.
Yeah... Yeah. Good idea.
Really?
You guys, you guys, get in your rooms.
Lock 'em in."
Biff Tannen,"J, AR","Bully, Jerk Jock","I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!
Blind spot? Now, now, Biff, now I never noticed that the car had any blind spot before when I would drive it. Hi, Son.
What, are you blind, McFly? It's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there?
Biff, can I- Can I assume that your, uh, insurance is gonna pay for the damage?
My insurance? It's your car. Your insurance should pay for it. I wanna know who's gonna pay for this?
I spilled beer all over it when the car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill?
Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.
What are you looking at, butthead?
Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.
Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?
Mr. McFly! Mr. McFly, this just arrived. Oh, hi, Marty. I think it's your new book.
Oh, honey! Your first novel.
Like I've always told you, you put your mind to it, you can accomplish *anything*.
Oh, Marty. Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight.
Keys?
Say hi to your mom for me.
I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?
Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.
I'm just finishing up the second coat now.
Now, Biff, don't con me.
I'm sorry, Mr. McFly. I-I meant I was just starting on the second coat.
Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...
We never would have fallen in love.
That's right.
I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.
And where's my reports?
Well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know, I... I figured since they weren't due till...
Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?
Of course not, Biff. Now, I wouldn't want that to happen. Now, look. I'll, uh, finish those reports on up tonight, and I'll run 'em on over first thing tomorrow, all right?
Not too early. I sleep in Saturday. Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied.
Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.
I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!

A rose that squirts. People come to smell it, it squirts them.
I'm getting my old man a Flit gun.
A Flit gun?
Yeah.
Stop right there.
Who, me?
Yeah, you! Get over there!
I can't now, Grover. I've... I've gotta go see Miss Shields.
Hey, come here! Get back here!
Yeah, you get back here! Come back here!

Travis Bickle,K,Byronic Hero,"Loneliness has followed me my whole life, everywhere. In bars, in cars, sidewalks, stores, everywhere. There's no escape. I'm God's lonely man.
You're only as healthy as you feel.
Listen, you fuckers, you screwheads. Here is a man who would not take it anymore. A man who stood up against the scum, the cunts, the dogs, the filth, the shit. Here is a man who stood up.
Huh? Huh?
Faster than you, fucking son of a... Saw you coming you fucking... shitheel.
I'm standing here; you make the move. You make the move. It's your move...
Don't try it you fuck.
You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me? Then who the hell else are you talking... you talking to me? Well I'm the only one here. Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? Oh yeah? OK.
I realize now how much she's just like the others, cold and distant, and many people are like that, women for sure, they're like a union.
I first saw her at Palantine Campaign headquarters at 63rd and Broadway. She was wearing a white dress. She appeared like an angel. Out of this filthy mess, she is alone. They... cannot... touch... her.
All the animals come out at night - whores, skunk pussies, buggers, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies, sick, venal. Someday a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets. I go all over. I take people to the Bronx, Brooklyn, I take 'em to Harlem. I don't care. Don't make no difference to me. It does to some. Some won't even take spooks. Don't make no difference to me.
I'll tell you why. I think you're a lonely person. I drive by this place a lot and I see you here. I see a lot of people around you. And I see all these phones and all this stuff on your desk. It means nothing. Then when I came inside and I met you, I saw in your eyes and I saw the way you carried yourself that you're not a happy person. And I think you need something. And if you want to call it a friend, you can call it a friend.
Are you gonna be my friend?
Yeah.
I got some bad ideas in my head.
Thank God for the rain to wash the trash off the sidewalk.
June twenty-ninth. I gotta get in shape. Too much sitting has ruined my body. Too much abuse has gone on for too long. From now on there will be 50 pushups each morning, 50 pullups. There will be no more pills, no more bad food, no more destroyers of my body. From now on will be total organization. Every muscle must be tight.
Now I see this clearly. My whole life is pointed in one direction. There never has been a choice for me.
Wanna work uptown at nights? South Bronx? Harlem?
I'll work anytime, anywhere.
Will you work on Jewish holidays?
Anytime, anywhere.
Each night when I return the cab to the garage, I have to clean the cum off the back seat. Some nights, I clean off the blood.
Travis, I'm... how much was it?
So long.
I think someone should just take this city and just... just flush it down the fuckin' toilet.
You know what you remind me of?
What?
That song by Kris Kristofferson.
Who's that?
A songwriter. 'He's a prophet... he's a prophet and a pusher, partly truth, partly fiction. A walking contradiction.'
You sayin' that about me?
Who else would I be talkin' about?
I'm no pusher. I never have pushed.
No, no. Just the part about the contradictions. You are that.
The days go on and on... they don't end. All my life needed was a sense of someplace to go. I don't believe that one should devote his life to morbid self-attention, I believe that one should become a person like other people.
God, you're square.
Hey, I'm not square, you're the one that's square. You're full of shit, man. What are you talking about? You walk out with those fuckin' creeps and low-lifes and degenerates out on the streets and you sell your little pussy for peanuts? For some low-life pimp who stands in the hall? And I'm square? You're the one that's square, man. I don't go screwing fuck with a bunch of killers and junkies like you do. You call that bein' hip? What world are you from?
Loneliness has followed me my whole life. Everywhere. In bars, in cars, sidewalks, stores, everywhere. There's no escape. I'm God's lonely man... June 8th. My life has taken another turn again. The days can go on with regularity over and over, one day indistinguishable from the next. A long continuous chain. Then suddenly, there is a change.
The idea had been growing in my brain for some time: TRUE force. All the king's men cannot put it back together again.
I would say he has quite a few problems. His energy seems to go in the wrong places. When I walked in and I saw you two sitting there, I could just tell by the way you were both relating that there was no connection whatsoever. And I felt when I walked in that there was something between us. There was an impulse that we were both following. So that gave me the right to come in and talk to you. Otherwise I never would have felt that I had the right to talk to you or say anything to you. I never would have had the courage to talk to you. And with him I felt there was nothing and I could sense it. When I walked in, I knew I was right. Did you feel that way?
I wouldn't be here if I didn't.
Look at it this way. A man takes a job, you know? And that job - I mean, like that - That becomes what he is. You know, like - You do a thing and that's what you are. Like I've been a cabbie for thirteen years. Ten years at night. I still don't own my own cab. You know why? Because I don't want to. That must be what I want. To be on the night shift drivin' somebody else's cab. You understand? I mean, you become - You get a job, you become the job. One guy lives in Brooklyn. One guy lives in Sutton Place. You got a lawyer. Another guy's a doctor. Another guy dies. Another guy gets well. People are born, y'know? I envy you, your youth. Go on, get laid, get drunk. Do anything. You got no choice, anyway. I mean, we're all fucked. More or less, ya know.
I don't know. That's about the dumbest thing I ever heard.
It's not Bertrand Russell. But what do you want? I'm a cabbie. What do I know? I don't even know what the fuck you're talking about.
Maybe I don't know either.
How's your driving record? Clean?
It's clean, real clean. Like my conscience.
I should get one of those signs that says ""One of these days I'm gonna get organezized"".
You mean organized?
Organezized. Organezized. It's a joke. O-R-G-A-N-E-Z-I-Z-E-D...
Oh, you mean organezized. Like those little signs they have in offices that says, ""Thimk""?
Hello Betsy. Hi, it's Travis. How ya doin'? Listen, uh, I'm, I'm sorry about the, the other night. I didn't know that was the way you felt about it. Well, I-I didn't know that was the way you felt. I-I-I would have taken ya somewhere else. Uh, are you feeling better or oh you maybe had a virus or somethin', a 24-hour virus you know. It happens. Yeah, umm, you uh, you're workin' hard. Yeah. Uh, would you like to have, uh, some dinner, uh with me in the next, you know, few days or somethin'? Well, how about just a cup of coffee? I'll come by the, uh, headquarters or somethin', we could, uh... Oh, OK, OK. Did you get my flowers in the...? You didn't get them. I sent some flowers, uh... Yeah, well, OK, OK. Can I call you again? Uh, tomorrow or the next day? OK. No, I'm gonna... OK. Yeah, sure, OK. So long.
Hey Sport. How ya doin'?
Okay, okay my man, how... Where do I know you from, man?
I don't know. How's everything in the pimp business, huh?
Do I know you?
No. Do I know you?
Get outta here. Come on, get lost, huh.
Do I know you? How's Iris? You know Iris.
No, I don't know nobody name Iris. Iris? Come on, get outta here, man.
You don't know anybody by the name of Iris?
I don't know nobody name Iris!
No?
Hey, go back to your fuckin' tribe before you get hurt, huh man. Do me a favor, I don't want no trouble, huh. Okay?
You got a gun?
Get the fuck outta here, man.
Get outta here.
Suck on this.
Shit... I'm waiting for the sun to shine.
Let me tell you something. You're in a hell, and you're gonna die in a hell, just like the rest of 'em!
Twelve hours of work and I still can't sleep. Damn. Days go on and on. They don't end.
Harry, answer that.
So whaddya want to hack for, Bickle?
I can't sleep nights.
There's porno theaters for that.
Yeah, I know. I tried that.
So what do you do now?
Well, I ride around nights mostly... subways, buses... I figure, you know, if I'm gonna do that I might as well get paid for it.
So what is it? Why do you want to be a taxi driver? Do you need a second job? Are you moonlighting?
I... I just want to work long hours. What's moonlighting?
May 10th. Thank God for the rain which has helped wash away the garbage and trash off the sidewalks. I'm workin' long hours now, six in the afternoon to six in the morning. Sometimes even eight in the morning, six days a week. Sometimes seven days a week. It's a long hustle but it keeps me real busy. I can take in three, three fifty a week. Sometimes even more when I do it off the meter. All the animals come out at night - whores, skunk pussies, buggers, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies, sick, venal. Someday a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets. I go all over. I take people to the Bronx, Brooklyn, I take 'em to Harlem. I don't care. Don't make no difference to me. It does to some. Some won't even take spooks. Don't make no difference to me.
How's everything in the pimp business?
You got a .44 magnum?
It's an expensive weapon.
That's all right. I got money.
It's a real monster. It'll stop a car at a hundred yards. Put a round right through the engine block.
I tried several times to call her, but after the first call, she wouldn't come to the phone any longer. I also sent flowers but with no luck. The smell of the flowers only made me sicker. The headaches got worse. I think I got stomach cancer. I shouldn't complain though. You're only as healthy, you're only as healthy as you feel. You're only as... healthy... as... you... feel.
Dear Father and Mother: July is the month I remember which brings not only your wedding anniversary but also Father's Day and Mother's birthday. I'm sorry I can't remember the exact dates, but I hope this card will take care of them all. I'm sorry again I cannot send you my address like I promised to last year. But the sensitive nature of my work for the government demands utmost secrecy. I know you will understand. I am healthy and well and making lots of money. I have been going with a girl for several months and I know you would be proud if you could see her. Her name is Betsy but I can tell you no more than that... I hope this card finds you all well as it does me. I hope no one has died. Don't worry about me. One day, they'll be a knock on the door and it'll be me. Love Travis.
You're a young girl, you should be at home. You should be dressed up, going out with boys, going to school, you know, that kind of stuff.
Twelve hours of work and I still can't sleep. Damn. Days go on and on. They don't end.
I first saw her at Palantine Campaign headquarters at 63rd and Broadway. She was wearing a white dress. She appeared like an angel. Out of this filthy mess, she is alone. They... cannot... touch... her.
May 26th. Four o'clock p.m. I took Betsy to Charles Coffee Shop on Columbus Circle. I had black coffee and apple pie with a slice of melted yellow cheese. I think that was a good selection. Betsy had coffee and a fruit salad dish. She could have had anything she wanted.
Now I see it clearly. My whole life is pointed in one direction. I see that now. There never has been any choice for me.
See ya later, copper!
I'm no cop, man.
Well, if you are, then it's entrapment already.
Can I help you?
Hi, what's your name. My name's Travis.
That's nice. What can I do for you?
Well, I'd like to know your name.
Give me a break.
Each night when I return the cab to the garage, I have to clean the cum off the back seat. Some nights, I clean off the blood.
All my life needed was a sense of someplace to go. I don't believe that one should devote his life to morbid self-attention. I believe that someone should become a person like other people.
I called Betsy again at her office and she said maybe we'd go to a movie together after she gets off work tomorrow. That's my day off. At first she hesitated but I called her again and then she agreed. Betsy, Betsy. Oh no, Betsy what? I forgot to ask her last name again. Damn. I got to remember stuff like that.
The idea had been growing in my brain for some time. True force. All the king's men cannot put it back together again.
Dear Iris: This money should be used for your trip. By the time you read this, I will be dead. Travis.
Loneliness has followed me my whole life. Everywhere. In bars, in cars, sidewalks, stores, everywhere. There's no escape. I'm God's lonely man.
I realize now how much she's just like the others - cold and distant, and many people are like that. Women for sure. They're like a union.
Loneliness has followed me my whole life. Everywhere. In bars, in cars, sidewalks, stores, everywhere. There's no escape. I'm God's lonely man. June 8th. My life has taken another turn again. The days can go on with regularity over and over, one day indistinguishable from the next. A long continuous chain. Then suddenly, there is a change.
June 29th. I gotta get in shape now. Too much sittin' is ruinin' my body. Too much abuse has gone on for too long. From now on, it will be fifty push-ups each morning, fifty pull-ups. There'll be no more pills, there'll be no more bad food, no more destroyers of my body. From now on, it will be total organization. Every muscle must be tight."
Martin Q. Blank,K,Byronic Hero,"Don't you think that maybe you're just upset because I told you what I do for a living, and you got upset and *you're* letting it interfere with *our* dynamic?
Whoa. Martin. You didn't tell me what you did for a living...
Yes, I did!
You didn't tell me what you did for a living for *four* sessions. *Then* you told me. And I said, ""I don't want to work with you any more."" And yet, you come back each week at the same time. That's a difficulty for me. On top of that, if you've committed a crime or you're thinking about committing a crime, I have to tell the authorities.
I know the law, okay? But I don't want to be withholding; I'm very serious about this process.
And I know where you live.
Oh, now see? That wasn't a nice thing to say; that wasn't designed to make me feel good. That's a... kind of a... not too subtle intimidation, and I, uh, get filled with anxiety when you talk about something like that.
Come on, come on. I was just kidding, all right? The thought never crossed my mind.
You did think of it, Martin! You thought it, and then you said it. And now, I'm left with the aftermath of that, thinking I gotta be creative in a really interesting way or Martin's gonna blow my brains out! You're holding me hostage. That's not right.
So, is there a Mrs. Mysterio?
No, but I do have a very nice cat?
Not the same.
Well, you don't know my cat, it's very demanding.
It? You don't know if it's a boy or girl?
I respect its privacy.
Don't kill anybody for a few days. See what it feels like.
Alright, I'll give it a shot.
No, don't give it a shot! Don't shoot anything!
Dr. Oatman, please pick up, pick up! It's Martin Blank! I, I'm standing where my, uh, living room was and it's not here because my house is gone and it's an Ultimart! You can never go home again, Oatman... but I guess you can shop there.
Sir, they're very unhappy.
I'm very unhappy.
It was supposed to look like a heart attack! He was supposed to die in his sleep!
Well, he moved.
I had the yearbook pictures put on so everybody knows who everybody was!
A special torture!
You must've done some *naughty* shit there, Bart.
There's a contract out on your life. Believe me. I was hired to kill you, but I'm not going to do it. It's either because I'm in love with your daughter or because I have a newfound respect for life.
That punk is either in love with that guy's daughter or he has a newfound respect for life.
My whole life!
Hopefully not.
Oh, the reason I called... Could you find out who else is in town? I've made two spooks and a ghoul already, so if they've double-booked the job, and/or they're going to kill me, I'd like to know. If you could find that out, that'd be great.
Do you *really* believe that there's some stored up conflict that exists between us? There *is* no us. *We* don't exist. So who do you wanna hit, man? It's not me. Now whaddya wanna do here, man?

I don't know what that is.
These are my words.
It's a poem? See, that's the problem... express yourself, Bob! Go for it.
""When I feel... quiet... when... I feel... blue...""
You know, I think that is *terrific*, what you have right there. Really, I liked it, a lot. I wouldn't sell the dealership or anything but, I'm tellin' ya... it's intense!
There's... more.
Okay, would ya mind, just skip to the end.
To... the very end? ""For a while.""
Whew. That's good man.
""For a while.""
That's excellent!
You wanna do some blow?
No I don't.

What about you? Joined the force, huh?
Oh no, I'm not a peace officer. Yeah, this badge isn't a meaningful symbol. We don't enforce the law, we just execute company policy for homeowners.
Oh, right... you mind talking a little shop?
Sure.
When are you authorized to use deadly force?
Oh well, you know, taxes provide your basic services, you know, police and whatnot, but our customers, they need a little bit more than that, so we catch you on the property, we do what we have to do.
So, if I just look suspicious on your customers' property - under those, you know, ""heightened circumstances"" - you have the authority to shoot me?
Correct.
Wow, all right. How'd you get the gig?
Oh, well, they were hiring. And it was only a two-week course.
I've got to get something off my chest. Have you been home to see the old house?
Yeah. Torn down in the name of convenience.
Yeah, I brokered the deal
Oh, wow. Wow.
I tried to get a family there, but Ultimart made the best offer.
Well, thank you for profiting on my childhood.
Are you all right?
No, I'm not all right!
Take it easy.
I'm hurt... I'm pissed... gotta find a new job!
Design Division wants me dead over a leaky sunroof and you want to kill me because of *that*?
It's *not* me! Why does everyone always think it's personal?
Mrs K? Miss Kinetta. It's me, Martin
Martin, my god, it's you!
Hey.
You've been Detroit's most famous disappearing act since white flight.
You know, when you started getting invited to your ten year high school reunion, time is catching up.
Are you talking about a sense of my own mortality or a fear of death?
Well, I never really thought about it quite like that.
Did you go to yours?
Yes, I did. It was just as if everyone had swelled.
Ya sure Oregon doesn't ring a bell? The Pacific Northwest, couple of months ago? Something about you doin' some wonderdog named Cujo...
Ah, *Budro*, yes, Budro, Jesus Christ! Yeah, I was out there tryin' to whack these junk bond fuckos and these idiots were flushing game with sticks of dynamite! And the dog that they borrowed, little Budro, was a retriever, get it? Budro was never a target, Budro was acting on instinct. I would never hurt an animal and I'm offended at the accusation...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Chatty Cathy! Clip yer string, I don't need to know! But, just for the record, here's what I heard: the marks borrowed your client's prize hunting pup. So, bad luck for Budro and bad luck for Blank. Poodle pumper. Hound hitter. Pooch puncher!
But listen, uh, if you wanna go, I can't think of any reason why we wouldn't go together.
I can.
Kid, I'm putting together a little concern, which would enable those of us in our, uh, rarified profession to avoid embarrassing overlaps.
What, like a union?
More like a club. You know, work less, make more.
Wow, sounds like a great idea, but... thank you, no.
No? You remember Burma?
Yeah, I do.
That nut, General Kwang? You were like a... colonel in that army, weren't you?
Yeah, yeah, he sold you all those tanks, you shipped 'em to Alabama...
T-34s, I took a bath on that.
Yeah, that was fun.
That's what I'm talking about, kid, we could be working together again, for God's sake! You know, making big money, killing important people!
Look, I don't want to play against you! This thing is real.
How real?
Maranga Brothers, them, uh, East German ex-Stasi guys...
Oh, I don't like those guys.
Them butch Filipino ladies...
What, the dwarf, maid...
Stabbers! Queens of the hotel hit, you know.
You got a great crew.
Everybody's in!
Yeah well, not me, so don't paw at me with your dirty little guild, okay?
Where ya been these last ten years?
Yeah, where ya been, ""Marv""?
Ya look great!
Thanks. I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Ya do not!
I do! I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland.
You're so funny.
He's a funny guy."
Brand Hauser,K,Byronic Hero,"Did you know that the word ""person"" comes from the Latin word ""persona"", which means mask? So maybe being human means we invite spectators to ponder what lies behind. Each of us will be composed of a variety of masks, and if we can see behind the mask, we would get a burst of clarity. And if that flame was bright enough, that's when we fall in love. What's your opinion on these divine matters?
I'm not going to fuck you. You know that, right?
Be still my trembling hands, for how you would tremble if you knew where I would take you next.
You know that all my writings have called this occupation a violation of international law and its practitioners are criminals?
Do you really believe all this stuff you write?
Anyone who can causes this much mayhem when they didn't have to? The amount of suffering that I've seen?
I know.
Ok. Hold on a sec.
But the way I look at it is this: the day we can actually feel and hear all the suffering of mankind, that's the day when ""The Christ"" will come back! So we got that going for us.
I'll be out in a minute.
Or 'The Buddha', or Allah, whoever floats your boat.
You can't do this. You can't do this. I won't let you. I'm your father.

It's me. I've loved you since the day you were born.
Each girl is a transfemoral amputee that lost her leg during the liberation.
And thanks to Tamerlane's cutting edge prosthetic devices, we can literally have you up and dancing before you know it.
just another breathtaking example of how American know-how alleviates the suffering it creates.
...And Coniel Bislan, an M72 rocket-propelled grenade that mistakenly hit her high school.
And Tamerlane used the exact same RPG firing pin rod assembly technology that it uses in the prosthetic knees of its dancing legs.
Talk about vertical integration!
Every empire is summed up in Rome. The Romans, Hauser, Stewards of the human race, torchbearers of culture! You and I are centurions, honor bound to defend civilization against the barbarians!
Let's cut the shit, Walken! I like killing people as much as the next guy, but I signed up to kill the bad ones! Health clinics, trade unionists, journalists, agricultural co-ops, catholic liberation theologians, impoverished Colombian coffee farmers, these are the barbarians that are brave opponents of civilization? We turned Central America into a fuckin' graveyard! Whoever momentarily interrupts the acummulation of our wealth, we pulverize! I'm just not feeling good about that anymore, sir!
I feel...
Go on.
...like a refugee from the Island of Dr. Moreau. Some morally inverted, twisted character from a Céline novel. The hot sauce helps.
When did they start attacking inside the Emerald City?
I wouldn't call that an attack.
Technically, that was a bombing. At least it sounded like it was. Not an attack, which would imply something else.
Look, we've already kicked the shit out of this place. What are we supposed to do? Turn our backs on all the entrepreneur possibilities? Business is a uniquely human response to a moral or cosmic crisis. Whether it's a tsunami or a sustained aerial bombardment, there's the same urgent call for urban renewal.
We're excited to have you.
Don't get too excited.
I'm not that excited.
Tell me about yourself?
I'm just doing this gig, trying to make the best of a bad situation, looking for redemption in all the wrong places. Stop me now if I'm rambling.
Okay, stop.
This little Turaqi pop star. She really disturbs me and I can't figure out why.
Do you want massage with happy ending?
Does your father know that you talk this way?
That was beautiful. Have you recorded it yet?
Fat fucking chance.
Well, you should. I feel like I'm seeing you for the first time.
You've seen my ass, and you're not liking it.
Why do you do that?
Do what?
Talk as if you've got no soul.
Nobody cares for my beautiful soul. They care for my ass.
Please, you sound like a tramp.
Bitches rule. Yonica rules. Virgins are good for getting fucked. Right? That is what I'm good for. Right? That's what everybody knows. Hmm?
You know what I think? I think the girl who wrote that song is a poet. I thought that song was really great.
I'm not from this world. I have special powers. I can see inside people's brains.
What if we publicly remove one of his testicles?
Dad, please!
Shut up.
It's not an entirely unappealing suggestion, but I'm not sure if that really gets us where we want to go.
Don't look at me!
I like looking at you.
There is a reason why I do this work: I don't have to feel anything.
That's so fucked up.
It's going to be hard... to torture someone who's mostly dead... but I'm gonna try... to enjoy it.
Marsha, get me Katie Couric, Al Jezeera and 100 gallons of sheep shit.
Sometimes I think it's better not to feel. Just skip it.
How long can you live that way? The poison just holds. It's like a slow motion suicide.
You wake up one day and wonder if you have the courage to walk away, to say ""No, I won't do that. I'm not that person. I'm not that thing.""
So you want to seduce the journalist whose politics you despise?
How dare you. I have no politics."
Cobb,"AK, K","Gentleman Thief, Byronic Hero","What is the most resilient parasite? Bacteria? A virus? An intestinal worm? An idea. Resilient... highly contagious. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate. An idea that is fully formed - fully understood - that sticks; right in there somewhere.
I need to get home. That's all I care about right now.
Why can't you go home?
Because they think I killed her.

Thank you.
For what?
For not asking whether I did.
It would have to be a 747.
Why is that?
Because in a 747, the pilot's up top, and the first class cabin's in the nose, so no one would walk through. But you'd have to buy out the entire cabin. And the first class flight attendant...
I bought the airline.
It seemed neater.
She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget.
You're waiting for a train. A train that'll take you far away. You know where you hope this train will take you. But you can't know for sure. Yet it doesn't matter. Now, tell me why?
Because you'll be together!
Why is it so important to dream?
Because, in my dreams we are together.
Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange.
Have you come to kill me? I've been waiting for someone...
Someone from a half remembered dream.
Cobb? Impossible. We were young men together. I'm an old man.
Filled with regret...
Waiting to die alone...
I've come back for you... to remind you of something. Something you once knew...
That this world is not real.
To convince me to honor our arrangement.
To take a leap of faith, yes. Come back... so we can be young men together again. Come back with me...
Come back...
We'd be together forever. You promised me.
I know. But we can't. And I'm sorry.
You remember when you asked me to marry you? You said you dreamt that we'd grow old together.
But we did. We did. You don't remember?... I miss you more than I can bear, but... we had our time together. And I have to let go... I have to let you go.
I can't stay with her anymore because she doesn't exist.
I'm the only thing you do believe in anymore.
I wish. I wish more than anything. But I can't imagine you with all your complexity, all you perfection, all your imperfection. Look at you. You are just a shade of my real wife. You're the best I can do; but I'm sorry, you are just not good enough.
They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything.
Inception. Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible...
No, it's perfectly possible. It's just bloody difficult.
So, once we've made the plant, how do we go out? Hope you have something more elegant in mind than shooting me in the head?
A kick.
What's a kick?
This, Ariadne, would be a kick

I'm going to improvise. Listen, there's something you should know about me... about inception. An idea is like a virus, resilient, highly contagious. The smallest seed of an idea can grow. It can grow to define or destroy you.
What do you want?
Inception. Is it possible?
Of course not.
If you can steal an idea, why can't you plant one there instead?
Okay, this is me, planting an idea in your mind. I say: don't think about elephants. What are you thinking about?
Elephants?
Right, but it's not your idea. The dreamer can always remember the genesis of the idea. True inspiration is impossible to fake.
No, it's not.
I'm asking you to take a leap of faith.
No I can't. You know I can't do that. Take a second, think about our children. Think about James. Think about Phillipa now.
If I go without you they'll take them away anyways.
What does that mean?
I filed a letter with our attourney explaining how I'm fearful for my safety. How you've threatened to kill me.
Why did you do that?
I love you, Dom.
Why did you... why-why would you do that?
I freed you from the guilt of choosing to leave them. We're going home to our real children.
No, no, no, no. Mal you listen to me, alright? Mal look at me, please.
You're waiting for a train...
Mal, goddammit! Don't do this!
A train that will take you far away...
James and Phillipa are waiting!
You know where you hope this train will take you...
They're waiting for us!
But you can't know for sure...
Mal, look at me!
Yet it doesn't matter...
Mal, goddammit!
Because you'll be together.
Sweetheart! Look at me!

Mal, no! Jesus Christ!
""I will split up my father's empire."" Now, this is obviously an idea that Robert himself would choose to reject. Which is why we need to plant it deep in his subconscious. Subconscious is motivated by emotion, right? Not reason. We need to find a way to translate this into an emotional concept.
How do you translate a business strategy into an emotion?
That's what we're here to figure out, right? Now, Robert's relationship with his father is stressed, to say the least.
Well, can we run with that? We could suggest to him breaking up his father's company as a ""screw-you"" to the old man.
No, 'cause I think positive emotion trumps negative emotion every time. We all yearn for reconciliation, for catharsis. We need Robert Fischer to have a positive emotional reaction to all this.
Alright, we'll try this, umm... ""My father accepts that I want to create for myself, not follow in his footsteps.""
That might work.
Might? We're gonna need to do a little better than 'might'.
Oh, thank you for your contribution, Arthur.
Forgive me for wanting a little specificity, Eames.
Specificity?
That price on my head, was that dead or alive?
Not sure. See if he starts shooting.
Brain function in the dream will be about twenty times to normal. When you enter a dream within that dream, the effect is compounded: it's three dreams, that's ten hours times twen...
I'm sorry, uh, maths was never my strong subject. How much time is that?
It's a week the first level down. Six months the second level down, and... the third level...
...is ten years! Who would wanna be stuck in a dream for ten years?
Depends on the dream.
You create the world of the dream, you bring the subject into that dream, and they fill it with their subconscious.
How could I ever acquire enough detail to make them think that its reality?
Well dreams, they feel real while we're in them, right? It's only when we wake up that we realize how things are actually strange. Let me ask you a question, you, you never really remember the beginning of a dream do you? You always wind up right in the middle of what's going on.
I guess, yeah.
So how did we end up here?
Well we just came from the a...
Think about it Ariadne, how did you get here? Where are you right now?
We're dreaming?
You're actually in the middle of the workshop right now, sleeping. This is your first lesson in shared dreaming. Stay calm.
Why are they all looking at me?
Because my subconscious feels that someone else is creating this world. The more you change things, the quicker the projections start to converge on you.
Converge?
It's the foreign nature of the dreamer. They attack like white blood cells fighting an infection.
They're going to attack us?
No. Just you.
What about his security? It's gonna get worse as we go deeper.
I think we run with Mr. Charles.
No.
Who's Mr. Charles?
Bad idea.
The second we get in that hotel with Fischer, his security is gonna be all over us. We run with Mr. Charles like we did on the Stein job.
So you've done it before?
Yeah, and it didn't work. The subject realized he was dreaming and his subconscious tore us to pieces.
Excellent. But you learned a lot, right?
What are you doing here?
My name is...
I know who you are. What are you doing here?
I'm just trying to understand...
How could you understand? Do you know what it is to be a lover? To be half of a whole?
No...
I'll tell you a riddle. You're waiting for a train. A train that will take you far away. You know where you hope this train will take you; but you don't know for sure. But it doesn't matter. How can it not matter to you where that train will take you?
Because you'll be together.
She had locked something away, something deep inside her. The truth that she had once known, but... she chose to forget. Limbo became her reality.
What happened when you woke up?
To wake up from that after, after years, after decades... after we'd become old souls thrown back into youth like that... I knew something was wrong with her. She just wouldn't admit it. Eventually, she told me the truth. She was possessed by an idea, this one, very simple idea, that changed everything. That our world wasn't real. That she needed to wake up to come back to reality, that, in order to get back home, we had to kill ourselves.
How's he doing?
He's in a lot of pain.
When we get down to the lower levels, the pain will be less intense.
And if he dies?
Worst case scenario? When he wakes up, his mind is completely gone.
Cobb. I'll still honor the arrangement.
I appreciate that, Saito, but when you wake up, you won't even remember that we had an arrangement. Limbo's gonna become your reality. You're gonna be lost down there so long that you're gonna become an old man.
Filled with regret.
Waiting to die alone.
No. I'll come back. And we'll be young men together again.
Very impressive.
I know this bridge. This place is real, isn't it?
Yeah, I cross it everyday on the way to the college.
Never recreate places from your memory. Always imagine new places.
Well, you gotta draw from stuff you know, right?
Only use details, a street lamp or a phone booth, never entire areas.
Why not?
Because building a dream from your memory is the easiest way to lose your grasp on what's real and what is a dream.
Is that what happened to you?
Hey listen to me. This has nothing to do with me. Understand?
Is that why you need me to build your dreams?
Where were you? What happened to you?
Got blocked by a freight train.
Why would you put a train course in the middle of a downtown intersection?
Why, I didn't.
Where did it come from?
Let me ask you a question, why the hell were we ambushed, huh? Those were not normal projections. They've been trained, for God's sakes!
You're right.
How could they be trained?
Fischer's had an extractor teach his subconscious to defend itself, so, his subconscious has militarized. It should have shown in the research. I'm sorry.
I think positive emotion trumps negative emotion every time.
These aren't just dreams. These are memories. And you said never to use memories.
I know I did.
You're trying to keep her alive. You can't let her go.
You don't understand. These are moments I regret, the memories that I have to change.
I knew Inception was possible because I'd done it to my wife.
You might have the rest of the team convinced to carry on with this job, but they don't know the truth.
Truth? What truth?
The truth that at any minute, you might bring a freight train through the wall. The truth that Mal is bursting through your subconscious. And the truth that as we go deeper into Fischer, we're also going deeper into you. And... I'm not sure we're gonna like what we find.
Never recreate from your memory. Always imagine new places!
Won't you tell me anything about this first?
Before I describe the job I have to know you can do it.
Why?
It's not, strictly speaking, legal.
You keep telling yourself what you know. But what do you believe? What do you feel?
Guilt.
You. What the hell was all that?
I have it under control.
I'd hate to see it out of control.
You create the world of the dream. We bring the subject into that dream and fill it with their subconscious.
How could I ever acquire enough detail to make them think that it's reality?
Well, dreams, they feel real while we're in them right? Its only when we wake up then we realize that something was actually strange.
The moment's passed. Whatever I do I can't change this moment. I'm about to call out to them. They run away. If I'm ever going to see their faces I've gotta get back home. The real world.
Downwards is the only way forwards.
Mr. Cobb has a job offer he would like to discuss with you.
Like a work placement?
Not exactly.
Cobb, I'm coming with you.
I promised Miles...
The team needs someone who understands what you're struggling with. And it doesn't have to be me, but then you have to show Arthur what I just saw.
Get us another seat on the plane.
There's no use threatening him in a dream, right, Mal?
It depends on what you're threatening. Killing him will just wake him up. But pain...
Pain is in the mind, and judging by the decor we're in your mind, aren't we, Arthur?
I miss you more than I can bear, but we had our time together. I have to let you go.
I came here to tell you... something.
Something that... you once knew to be true.
Impossible...
You shouldn't be here.
I just wanted to see what kind of tests you're doing on your own every night.
This has nothing to do with you.
This has everything to do with me. You've asked me to share dreams with you.
Not these. These are my dreams.
If I get on this plane and you don't honor our agreement, when we land, I go to jail for the rest of my life.
Complete the job en route. I make one phone call from the plane. You'll have no trouble getting through Immigration.
Ah. So, this is your idea of losing a tail, huh?
Different tail.
No idea is simple when you have to plant it in someone else's mind.
If I jump, would I survive?
A clean dive, perhaps. Mal, what are you doing here?
I thought you might be missing me.
You know I am but I can't trust you anymore.
So what?
You promised! You promised!
Please, I just have to keep you here, just for now.
You said we'd be together! You said we'd grow old together!
I'll come back, I promise.
Tell me, do the children miss me?
You can't imagine...
Why are they all looking at me?
Because my subconscious feels that someone else is creating this world. The more you change things, the quicker the projections start to converge on you.
Converge?
They sense the foreign nature of the dreamer. they attack like white blood cells fighting an infection.
What? They're going to attack us?
No, no.
Just you.
This is great, but I'm telling you, if you keep changing things...
I'm insured against kidnapping for up to 10 million. This should be very simple.
Shut up! It won't be.
In your father's office, below the bookshelves is his personal safe. We need the combination.
I don't know any safe.
That doesn't mean you don't know the combination. Tell us what it is.
I don't know.
We have it on good authority you do know.
Yeah? Whose authority?
I'm just doing what you taught me.
I never taught you to be a thief.
I can access your mind through your dreams.
You're asking me for Inception. I hope you do understand the gravity of that request.
How are you, huh? How are you doing?
Okay, I guess.
Who's just okay? Is that you, James?
Yeah. Is Mommy with you?
James, we talked about this. Mommy's not here anymore.
Where?
And you! You knew about this and went along with it!
I trusted him!
You trusted him! What, when he promised you half his share?
No, his whole share. Besides he said he'd done it before.
You've done it before? What, with Mal? 'Cause that worked so good!
That has nothing to do with it. I did what I had to do to get back to my children.
You got the basic layout. Bookstore, cafe, almost everything else is here too.
Who are the people?
Projections of my subconscious.
Yours?
Yes. Remember, you are the dreamer, you build this world. I am the subject, my mind populates it. You can literally talk to my subconscious. That's one of the ways we extract information from the subject.
How else do you do it?
By creating something secure, like a bank vault or a jail. The mind automatically fills it with information it's trying to protect. Understand?
Then you break in and steal it?
Well...
I guess I thought that the dream space would be all about the visual. But it's more about a feel of it. My question is what happens when you start messing with the physics of it all...?
It's something, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
All right, we continue on with the job, and we do it as fast as possible, and we get out using the kick, just like before.
Forget it. We go any deeper, we just raise the stakes. I am sitting this one out on this level, boys.
An idea is like a virus. Resilient. Highly contagious. And even the smallest seed of an idea can grow. It can grow to define or destroy you.
You're infecting my mind!
I was trying to save you.
You betrayed me, but you can still make amends. You can still keep your promise. We can still be together, right here. In the world we built together.
The seed that we planted in this man's mind may change everything.
I know how to find secrets from your Mind, I know all the tricks!
I don't like trains.
Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange.
She locked away a secret, deep inside herself: a truth that she once knew... but chose to forget.
Must have blown you off. That is unless her phone number really is only six digits. Funny way to make friends, someone stealing your wallet like that.
There's something you should know about me. About inception.
You're asking me for inception. I do hope you understand the gravity of that request.
Downward is the only way forward.
Never recreate places from your memories, always imagine new places. Only use details. A street lamp or a phone booth. Never entire areas. Building a dream from your memory is the easiest way of losing your grasp on what's real and what is a dream.
Strange weather. Isn't it?
Yeah. Well, I don't like trains.
What is the most resilient parasite? Bacteria? A virus? An intestinal worm? An idea. Resilient... highly contagious. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate. An idea that is fully formed - fully understood - that sticks; right in there somewhere.
I need to get home. That's all I care about right now.
Why can't you go home?
Because they think I killed her.

Thank you.
For what?
For not asking whether I did.
It would have to be a 747.
Why is that?
Because in a 747, the pilot's up top, and the first class cabin's in the nose, so no one would walk through. But you'd have to buy out the entire cabin. And the first class flight attendant...
I bought the airline.
It seemed neater.
She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget.
You're waiting for a train. A train that'll take you far away. You know where you hope this train will take you. But you can't know for sure. Yet it doesn't matter. Now, tell me why?
Because you'll be together!
Why is it so important to dream?
Because, in my dreams we are together.
Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange.
Have you come to kill me? I've been waiting for someone...
Someone from a half remembered dream.
Cobb? Impossible. We were young men together. I'm an old man.
Filled with regret...
Waiting to die alone...
I've come back for you... to remind you of something. Something you once knew...
That this world is not real.
To convince me to honor our arrangement.
To take a leap of faith, yes. Come back... so we can be young men together again. Come back with me...
Come back...
We'd be together forever. You promised me.
I know. But we can't. And I'm sorry.
You remember when you asked me to marry you? You said you dreamt that we'd grow old together.
But we did. We did. You don't remember?... I miss you more than I can bear, but... we had our time together. And I have to let go... I have to let you go.
I can't stay with her anymore because she doesn't exist.
I'm the only thing you do believe in anymore.
I wish. I wish more than anything. But I can't imagine you with all your complexity, all you perfection, all your imperfection. Look at you. You are just a shade of my real wife. You're the best I can do; but I'm sorry, you are just not good enough.
They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything.
Inception. Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible...
No, it's perfectly possible. It's just bloody difficult.
So, once we've made the plant, how do we go out? Hope you have something more elegant in mind than shooting me in the head?
A kick.
What's a kick?
This, Ariadne, would be a kick

I'm going to improvise. Listen, there's something you should know about me... about inception. An idea is like a virus, resilient, highly contagious. The smallest seed of an idea can grow. It can grow to define or destroy you.
What do you want?
Inception. Is it possible?
Of course not.
If you can steal an idea, why can't you plant one there instead?
Okay, this is me, planting an idea in your mind. I say: don't think about elephants. What are you thinking about?
Elephants?
Right, but it's not your idea. The dreamer can always remember the genesis of the idea. True inspiration is impossible to fake.
No, it's not.
I'm asking you to take a leap of faith.
No I can't. You know I can't do that. Take a second, think about our children. Think about James. Think about Phillipa now.
If I go without you they'll take them away anyways.
What does that mean?
I filed a letter with our attourney explaining how I'm fearful for my safety. How you've threatened to kill me.
Why did you do that?
I love you, Dom.
Why did you... why-why would you do that?
I freed you from the guilt of choosing to leave them. We're going home to our real children.
No, no, no, no. Mal you listen to me, alright? Mal look at me, please.
You're waiting for a train...
Mal, goddammit! Don't do this!
A train that will take you far away...
James and Phillipa are waiting!
You know where you hope this train will take you...
They're waiting for us!
But you can't know for sure...
Mal, look at me!
Yet it doesn't matter...
Mal, goddammit!
Because you'll be together.
Sweetheart! Look at me!

Mal, no! Jesus Christ!
""I will split up my father's empire."" Now, this is obviously an idea that Robert himself would choose to reject. Which is why we need to plant it deep in his subconscious. Subconscious is motivated by emotion, right? Not reason. We need to find a way to translate this into an emotional concept.
How do you translate a business strategy into an emotion?
That's what we're here to figure out, right? Now, Robert's relationship with his father is stressed, to say the least.
Well, can we run with that? We could suggest to him breaking up his father's company as a ""screw-you"" to the old man.
No, 'cause I think positive emotion trumps negative emotion every time. We all yearn for reconciliation, for catharsis. We need Robert Fischer to have a positive emotional reaction to all this.
Alright, we'll try this, umm... ""My father accepts that I want to create for myself, not follow in his footsteps.""
That might work.
Might? We're gonna need to do a little better than 'might'.
Oh, thank you for your contribution, Arthur.
Forgive me for wanting a little specificity, Eames.
Specificity?
That price on my head, was that dead or alive?
Not sure. See if he starts shooting.
Brain function in the dream will be about twenty times to normal. When you enter a dream within that dream, the effect is compounded: it's three dreams, that's ten hours times twen...
I'm sorry, uh, maths was never my strong subject. How much time is that?
It's a week the first level down. Six months the second level down, and... the third level...
...is ten years! Who would wanna be stuck in a dream for ten years?
Depends on the dream.
You create the world of the dream, you bring the subject into that dream, and they fill it with their subconscious.
How could I ever acquire enough detail to make them think that its reality?
Well dreams, they feel real while we're in them, right? It's only when we wake up that we realize how things are actually strange. Let me ask you a question, you, you never really remember the beginning of a dream do you? You always wind up right in the middle of what's going on.
I guess, yeah.
So how did we end up here?
Well we just came from the a...
Think about it Ariadne, how did you get here? Where are you right now?
We're dreaming?
You're actually in the middle of the workshop right now, sleeping. This is your first lesson in shared dreaming. Stay calm.
Why are they all looking at me?
Because my subconscious feels that someone else is creating this world. The more you change things, the quicker the projections start to converge on you.
Converge?
It's the foreign nature of the dreamer. They attack like white blood cells fighting an infection.
They're going to attack us?
No. Just you.
What about his security? It's gonna get worse as we go deeper.
I think we run with Mr. Charles.
No.
Who's Mr. Charles?
Bad idea.
The second we get in that hotel with Fischer, his security is gonna be all over us. We run with Mr. Charles like we did on the Stein job.
So you've done it before?
Yeah, and it didn't work. The subject realized he was dreaming and his subconscious tore us to pieces.
Excellent. But you learned a lot, right?
What are you doing here?
My name is...
I know who you are. What are you doing here?
I'm just trying to understand...
How could you understand? Do you know what it is to be a lover? To be half of a whole?
No...
I'll tell you a riddle. You're waiting for a train. A train that will take you far away. You know where you hope this train will take you; but you don't know for sure. But it doesn't matter. How can it not matter to you where that train will take you?

And if he dies?

Cobb. I'll still honor the arrangement.
I appreciate that, Saito, but when you wake up, you won't even remember that we had an arrangement. Limbo's gonna become your reality. You're gonna be lost down there so long that you're gonna become an old man.

I knew Inception was possible because I'd done it to my wife.
You might have the rest of the team convinced to carry on with this job, but they don't know the truth.
Truth? What truth?

Achilles,K,Byronic Hero,"I'll tell you a secret. Something they don't teach you in your temple. The Gods envy us. They envy us because we're mortal, because any moment might be our last. Everything is more beautiful because we're doomed. You will never be lovelier than you are now. We will never be here again.
You gave me peace in a lifetime of war.
You're still my enemy in the morning.
You're still my enemy tonight. But even enemies can show respect.
Imagine a king who fights his own battles. Wouldn't that be a sight?
Of all the warlords loved by the gods, I hate him the most.
We will meet again, my brother.
Who are you?
I have endured what no one on earth has endured before. I kissed the hands of the man who killed my son.
Priam? How did you get in here?
I know my country better than the Greeks, I think.
You are a brave man. I could have your head on a spit in the blink of an eye.
Do you really think death frightens me now? I watched my eldest son die, watched you drag his body behind your chariot. Give him back to me. He deserves a proper burial, you know that. Give him to me.
He killed my cousin.
He thought it was you. How many cousins have you killed? How many sons and fathers and brothers and husbands? How many, brave Achilles?
Myrmidons! My brothers of the sword! I would rather fight beside you than any army of thousands! Let no man forget how menacing we are, we are lions! Do you know what's waiting beyond that beach? Immortality! Take it! It's yours!
Why did you choose this life?
What life?
To be a great warrior.
I chose nothing. I was born and this is what I am.
Are the stories true? They say your mother was an immortal godess. They say you can't be killed.
I wouldn't be bothering with the shield then, would I?
The Thesselonian you're fighting... he's the biggest man i've ever seen. I wouldn't want to fight him.
Thats why no-one will remember your name.
Do it.
Do it. Nothing is easier.
Aren't you afraid?
Everyone dies, whether today or fifty years from now.
If I don't, you'll kill more men.
Many.
Go home, prince. Drink some wine, make love to your wife. Tomorrow, we'll have our war.
You speak of war as if it's a game. But how many wives wait at Troy's gates for husbands they'll never see again?
Perhaps your brother can comfort them. I hear he's good at charming other men's wives.
Play your tricks on me. But not on my cousin.
You have your swords. I have my tricks. We play with the toys the gods give us.
I've seen this moment in my dreams. I'll make a pact with you. With the gods as our witnesses, let us pledge that the winner will allow the loser all the proper funeral rituals.
There are no pacts between lions and men.
Now you know who you're fighting.
I thought it was you I was fighting yesterday. And I wish it had been, but I gave the dead boy the honor he deserved.
You gave him the honor of your sword. You won't have eyes tonight; you won't have ears or a tongue. You will wander the underworld blind, deaf, and dumb, and all the dead will know: This is Hector. The fool who thought he killed Achilles.
Of all the kings of Greece, I respect you most. But in this war you're a servant. And I refuse to be a servant any longer.
Sometimes you need to serve in order to lead. I hope you understand that one day.
We men are wretched things.
What's your name?
Did you not hear me?
You killed Apollo's priests!
I've killed men in five countries, never a priest.
Well, then your men did. The sun god will have his vengeance.
What's he waiting for?
The right time to strike.
His priests are dead, and his acolyte's a captive. i think your god is afraid of me.
Afraid? Apollo is master of the sun, he fears nothing.
Where is he?
You're nothing but a killer! You wouldn't know anything about the gods!
I know more about the gods than your priests. I've seen them. You're royalty, aren't you? Spent years talking down to men.
You must be royalty. What's your name? Even the servants of Apollo have names.
Briseis.
Are you afraid, Briseis?
Should I be?
My lord, Agamemnon requests your presence. The kings are gathering to celebrate the victory.
You fought well today.
My lord.
What do you want here in Troy? You didn't come for the Spartan queen.
I want what all men want, I just want it more. You don't need to fear me, girl. You're the only Trojan who can say that.
At night I see their faces. All the men I've killed. They're standing there on the far bank of the river Styx. They're waiting for me. They say, 'Welcome, brother'.
If I hurt you, it's not what I wanted
Would you leave this all behind?
Would you leave Troy?
You are free. If I hurt you, it's not what I wanted.
Go. No one will stop you. You have my word.
Things are less simple today.
Women have a way of complicating things.
Fight me!
Why kill you now, Prince of Troy, with no-one here to see you fall?
Trojan soldiers died protecting you. Perhaps they deserve more than your pity.
Prince Hector, is he as good a warrior as they say?
The best of all the Trojans. Some would say...
...he's better than all the Greeks.
Even if your cousin doesn't come, I hope you'll join us, Patroclus. We could use a strong arm like yours.
Play your tricks on me. But not on my cousin.
Why? Are the Greeks tired of fighting each other?
For now.
Patroclus, put down your spear...
But I'm fighting the Trojans, cousin.
Not today.
But I'm ready. You taught me how to fight.
You're a good student, but you're not a Myrmidon yet. Look at these men, they are the fiercest soldiers in all of Greece, each of them has bled for me. You will guard the ship...
But this is a war!
Cousin, I can't fight the Trojans if I'm concerned for you, guard the ship!
It's too early in the day to be killing princes.
I told you how to fight but I never told you why to fight.
I fight for you.
Yes, but who will you fight for when I'm gone? Soldiers fight for kings they've never even met. They fight when they're told to fight, they die when they're told to die.
Soldiers obey.
Myrmidans! Brothers of the sword, I rather fight beside you than any army of thousands!
Ahhooooo!
Let no man forget how menacing we are! We are Lions!
Ahhhooooo!
Do you know whats there, waiting beyond that beach? Immortality, take it, it's yours!
Ahhhooo ahooooo ahooooo!
Apparently you won some great victory.
Ah, Perhaps you didn't notice. The Trojan beach belonged to Priam in the morning. It belongs to Agamemnon in the afternoon.
You can have the beach. I didn't come here for sand.
No. You came here because you want your name to last through the ages. A great victory was won today, but that victory is not yours. Kings did not kneel to Achilles. Kings did not pay homage to Achilles.
Perhaps the kings were too far behind to see, the soldiers won the battle.
History remembers kings! Not soldiers! Tomorrow we'll batter down the gates of Troy! I'll build monuments to victory on every island of Greece. I'll carve ""Agamemnon"" in the stone.
Be careful, king of kings. First you need the victory.
Your men sacked the temple of Apollo, yes?
You want gold? Take it. It's my gift to honour your courage. Take what you wish.
I already have. Aphareus! Haemon!
The spoils of war.
No argument with you, brothers. But if you don't release her, you'll never see home again. Decide!
Guards!
Stop! Too many men have died today. If killing is your only talent, that's your curse. I don't want anyone dying for me.
Mighty Achilles, silenced by a slave girl. Tonight I'll have her give me a bath, and then, who knows?
You sack of wine! Before my time is done, I will look down on your corpse and smile.
Get up, Prince of Troy! I won't let a stone rob me of my glory!
If you sailed any slower the war would be over.
I'll miss the start as long as I'm here at the end.
You were brave to fight them. You have courage.
To fight back when I'm attacked? A dog has that kind of courage.
You are a far better king than the one leading this army.
Am I still your captive?
You're my guest.
In Troy, guests can leave whenever they want.
We should leave.
Is there no one else? Is there no one else?
King Agamemnon has sent for you.
Tell the king it can wait until morning.
Umm... it is morning.
The gods envy us.
You lost your cousin, and now you have taken mine. Where does it end?
It never ends.
We need you. Greece needs you.
Greece got along fine before I was born. And Greece will remain Greece long after I am gone.
Nervous?
Petrified.
Am I still your captive?
You're my guest.
In Troy, guests can leave whenever they want.
We should leave now.
Would you leave this war behind?
Would you leave Troy?
It's a beautiful night.
Never hesitate.
Speak.
Apollo sees everything! Perhaps-perhaps it is not wise to offend him.
Imagine a king who fought his own battles! That would be a sight!
Flank! To the flank!"
Britt Reid,K,Byronic Hero,"Kato, I want you to take my hand, and I want you to come with me on this adventure.
I go with you, but I don't want to touch you.
You shot yourself face by mistake.
How long was I out? What time is it?
Two o'clock.
Oh, that's not so bad.
On Thursday.
It's Thursday? Are you ki... It's not Monday right now?
No. I'm sorry.
Did you put this diaper on me? Well, what did I miss?
Nothing really. I did some work on the Black Beauties.
""Beauties""?
Holy crap.
They're backups.
How the hell did you do this in four days?
It's been 11 days.
Whoa, 11 days? What? Are kidding me? I wasn't sleeping, I was in a coma, dick!
It's not dying that you need be afraid of, it's never having lived in the first place.
I'm only thirty six.
Thirty six? Holy shit, I had no idea. I thought you were 31, tops. I don't even know if I can hire a thirty six year old. We'll have to build a ramp, huh?
The Green Hornet. His reliable partner, the Blue Wombat.

Oh! Oh, man. Okay, how about, um, the Red Hippopotamus? No? Not Red Hippopotamus?
Hippos are not red.
I know. Hornets aren't green. Who cares? The, uh, Orange Albatross.
What did you think of my father?
He was fine.
Come on. Just tell me.
He was my boss. Nobody loves their boss.
Don't sugarcoat this, Kato. You're not gonna offend me. Just tell me, man to man.
He was a bit of a dick.
I was born in Shanghai. You know Shanghai?
I love Japan.
Let's roll, Kato!
If you ever so much as look at my ass again...
I can't even see your ass.
I will sue you for sexual harassment. Do you understand?
Hugs?

You know what you are. You're a human Swiss army knife.
I don't know what's that mean?
It's a little things, and you keep pulling out things, and just when you think there couldn't be any more cool things, a new cool thing comes out, and that's you! You are even dressed like one. You should have a little plus on your chest.
But it's okay now, I fixed the Hornet gas. The gas only lasts one hour.
Can I see it?
Okay, but be careful this time. Okay?
I just want to look at it. Just give it to me for one second...
See you in an hour.
Kato, we have a secret mission.
You are blowing this guy completely out of proportion.
I will blow this guy in any proportion I want!
Who do you work... for...?
Girls are a drag. I'm so glad we have each other Kato.
Everyone knows, when you corner a hornet, you get stung.
You like your father now?
Yes! You see, he wasn't a dick after all. Well, he was a dick, just not really how we thought he was.
Do you it makes me happy to do this, dad?"
Donnie Darko,K,Byronic Hero,"Why are you wearing that stupid bunny suit?
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
You're weird.
Sorry.
No, that was a compliment actually.
I hope that when the world comes to an end, I can breathe a sigh of relief, because there will be so much to look forward to.
""Donnie Darko."" What the hell kind of name is that? It's like some sort of superhero or something.
What makes you think I'm not?
Donnie, what did Roberta Sparrow say to you?
She said that every living creature on Earth dies alone.
You're such a fuck-ass!
Please.
What? Did you just call me a ""fuck-ass""?
Elizabeth, that's enough.
You can go suck a fuck.
Oh, please, tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?
You want me to tell you?
Please, tell me.
We will not have this at the dinner table.
I'm all ears!
Beer and pussy. That's all I need.
We gotta find ourselves a Smurfette.
Smurfette?
Mm-hmm. Not some, like, tight-ass Middlesex chick, you know? Like, this cute little blonde that will get down and dirty with the guys. Like Smurfette does.
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
That's bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other Smurfs. Why do you think Papa Smurf made her? Because all the other Smurfs were getting too horny.
No, no, no, not Vanity. I heard he was a homosexual.
Okay, well, you know what? Then she fucks them while Vanity watches. Okay?
What about Papa Smurf? I mean, he must get in on all the action.
Yeah, what he does, he films the gang-bang. Later on, he beats off to the tape.
First of all, Papa Smurf didn't create Smurfette. Gargamel did. She was sent in as Gargamel's evil spy with the intention of destroying the Smurf village. But the overwhelming goodness of the Smurf way of life transformed her. And as for the whole gang-bang scenario - It just couldn't happen. Smurfs are asexual. They don't even have reproductive organs under those little white pants. That's what's so illogical, you know, about being a Smurf. What's the point of living... if you don't have a dick?
Damn it, Donnie. Why do you gotta get so smart on us?
Well, life isn't that simple. I mean, who cares if Ling Ling returns the wallet and keeps the money? It has nothing to do with either fear or love.
Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
Okay. But you're not listening to me. There are other things that need to be taken into account here, like the whole spectrum of human emotion. You can't just lump everything into these two categories and then just deny everything else.
When the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision, do they believe him?
Why should we care?
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was human?
Are you saying that the death of one species is less tragic than another?
Of course. The rabbit's not like us. It has no history books, no photographs, no knowledge of sorrow or regret. I mean, I'm sorry, Miss Pommeroy. Don't get me wrong. You know, I like rabbits and all. They're cute and they're horny. And if you're cute and you're horny, then you're probably happy that you don't know who you are or why you're even alive. You just wanna have sex as many times as possible before you die. I just don't see the point in crying over a dead rabbit, you know, who never even feared death to begin with.
Do you feel alone right now?
Oh, I don't know. I mean, I'd like to believe I'm not, but I just... I've just never seen any proof, so I... I just don't debate it anymore, you know? It's like I could spend my whole life debating it over and over again, weighing the pros and cons. And in the end, I still wouldn't have any proof. So I just... I just don't debate it anymore. It's absurd.
The search for God is absurd?
It is if everyone dies alone.
Does that scare you?
I don't want to be alone.
Son... Do you see this?
Right?
This is an anger prisoner. A textbook example.
Anger prisoner.
Do you see the fear, people? This boy is scared to death of the truth. Son, it breaks my heart to say this, but I believe you are a very troubled and confused young man. I believe you are searching for the answers in all the wrong places.
You're right, actually. I am pretty... I'm pretty troubled and I'm pretty confused, but I... And I'm afraid. Really, really afraid. Really afraid. But I-I think you're the fucking Antichrist.
My mom had to get a restraining order against my stepdad. He has emotional problems.
Oh, I have those, too. What kind of emotional problems does your dad have?
He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.
Oh.
Did you call the fucking cops?
Deus ex machina.
What did you just say? What the fuck did you just say?
Our savior.
That's some good shit, huh?
It's a fucking cigarette.
Do you still think about girls a lot?
Yeah.
How are things going at school?
I think about girls a lot.
I asked you about school, Donnie.
I think about fucking a lot during school.
What else do you think about during school?
Married with Children.
Do you think about your family?
I just turn down the volume and think about fucking Christina Applegate.
I asked you about your family, Donnie.
No. I don't think about fucking my family. That's gross.
28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, 12 seconds. That is when the world will end.
Why?
Dear Roberta Sparrow, I have reached the end of your book and there are so many things that I need to ask you. Sometimes I'm afraid of what you might tell me. Sometimes I'm afraid that you'll tell me that this is not a work of fiction. I can only hope that the answers will come to me in my sleep. I hope that when the world comes to an end, I can breathe a sigh of relief, because there will be so much to look forward to.
""'A storm is coming,' Frank says. 'A storm that will swallow the children. And I will deliver them from the kingdom of Bane. I'll deliver the children back to their doorsteps. I'll send the monsters back to the underground. I'll send them back to a place where no one else can see them except for me, 'cause I am Donnie Darko.'""
How's it feel to have a wacko for a son?
It feels wonderful.
I - I'm sorry. I...
Look, Donnie, wait.
I like you a lot.
I just want it to be at a time when it...
When what?
When it reminds me just...
When it reminds you how beautiful the world can be?
Yeah.
And right now there's some fat guy over there staring at us.
What happened to your eye?
I'm so sorry.
How can you do that?
I can do anything I want. And so can you.
Well, they say it right when they flood the house, and they tear it to shreds that, like, uh, destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart. They want to change things.
You can go suck a fuck.
Oh, please, tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?
I made a new friend.
Real or imaginary?
Imaginary.
Well, could these portals, um... Could these portals just appear anywhere, anytime?
I think that's highly unlikely. No, I think what you're talking about is an act of God.
Well, if God controls time, then all time is pre-decided.
I'm not following you.
Every living thing follows along a set path. And if you could see your path or channel, then you could see into the future, right? Like, uh... It's a form of time travel.
Well, you're-you're contradicting yourself there, Donnie. If we were able to see our destinies manifest themselves visually, then we would be given a choice to betray our chosen destinies. And the mere fact that this choice exists would make all preformed destiny, uh, come to an end.
Not if you travel within God's channel.
Um, I'm not going to be able to continue this conversation.
Why?
I could lose my job.
Okay.
Frank. When's this gonna stop?
You should already know that.
I think you're the fucking anti-Christ.
I promise that one day, everything's gonna be better for you.
Shut up!
Where did you come from?
Do you believe in time travel?
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
You want your sister to lose weight? Tell her to get off the couch, stop eating Twinkies and maybe go out for field hockey. You know what? No one ever knows what they want to be when they grow up. You know, it takes a little, little while to find that out. Right, Jim? And you. Yeah, you. Sick of some jerk shoving your head down the toilet? Well, you know what? Maybe you should lift some weights or take a karate lesson. And the next time he tries to do it, you kick him in the balls.
Well, look... You want to go with me?
Where do you want to go?
I mean, like, ""go"" with me. Like, you know... Like, it's what we call it here. ""Going together.""
Sure.
Okay. Hey, where are you going?
I'm going home.
I have to obey him. He saved my life. I have to obey him, or I'll be left all alone. And then... And then I won't be able to figure out what this is all about. I won't be able to know his master plan.
Do you mean *God's* master plan? Do you now believe in God?
I have the power to build a time machine.
How is that possible? How is time travel possible? Donnie?
Time's up, Frank said.
When is this going to happen?
S-S-Soon.
They didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas.
What did you want for Christmas that year?
Hungry, Hungry Hippos.
And how did you feel, being denied these Hungry, Hungry Hippos?
Regret.
What is going to happen?
Frank is gonna kill.
Who is he going to kill? Who is he going to kill, Donnie?
I can see him right now!
I was in jail once. I mean I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned, but still, I got held back in school and I can't drive until I'm 21. But I'm over all of that. I... I... I'm painting and stuff. Writing. I want to be a writer, or maybe a painter, I don't know, or maybe both. I'll write a book and draw the pictures. Then maybe people will understand me. I don't know, change things.
So, what do I tell the other kids when they ask about you?
Tell them that everything is gonna be just fine.
What happens if tell Mom and Dad about this, Sam?
You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
Goddamn right I will.
""Ling Ling finds a wallet on the ground filled with money. She takes the wallet to the address on the driver's license but keeps the money inside the wallet.""
I'm... I'm sorry, Mrs. Farmer. I don't get this.
Is she dead?... What were you guys doing in the middle of the road, huh? What are you thinking?
Go home! Go home and tell your parents everything's going to be OK. Go!
The sky's gonna open up.
I'm going home.
When will *I* ""squeeze one out?""
Not until 8th grade.
One day it will be better for you."
Robert Angier,K,Byronic Hero,"You went half way around the world, you spent a fortune, you did terrible things - really terrible things, Robert, and all for nothing.
For nothing?
Yeah
You never understood why we did this. The audience knows the truth: the world is simple. It's miserable, solid all the way through. But if you could fool them, even for a second, then you can make them wonder, and then you... then you got to see something really special. You really don't know? It was... it was the look on their faces...
Mr. Angier, have you considered the cost of such a machine?
Price is not an object.
Perhaps not, but have you considered the *cost*?
I'm not sure I follow.
Go home. Forget this thing. I can recognize an obsession, no good will come of it.
Why, haven't good come of your obsessions?
Well, at first. But I followed them too long. I'm their slave... and one day they'll choose to destroy me.
If you understand an obsession, then you know you won't change my mind.
No one cares about the man in the box, the man who disappears.
Take a minute to consider your achievement. I once told you about a sailor who drowned.
Yes, he said it was like going home.
I lied. He said it was agony.
Which hat is mine?
They are all your hat, Mr. Angier.
He's a dreadful magician.
No, he's a wonderful magician. He's a dreadful showman.
But here, at the turn, I must leave you Borden. Yes, you, Borden, sitting there in your cell, awaiting your death. For my murder.
You always were the better magician. We both know that. Whatever your secret was, you have to agree, mine is better.
Would I be the man in the box or the prestige?
Alive?
How fast can you dig?
Man's reach exceeds his imagination!
He's progressive, he's predictable, he's boring. I mean, Milton's got success, whatever that means, and now he's scared, he won't take any risks at all. I mean, he's squandering the goodwill of the audience with these tired, second-rate tricks...
They're all favorites, please...
Favorites? Come on, give me something fresh, he wont even try a bloody bullet catch!
A bullet catch is suicide, all it takes is some smart-ass volunteer to put a button in the barrel...
Fine, use a plant!
You can't use plants for every trick!
There'll be no seats left for the punters!
Fine, no bullet catch, whatever, but the point is... a real magician tries to invent something new, that other magicians are gonna scratch their heads over, you know?
Right, then you sell it to him for a small fortune?
All right...
I suppose you have such a trick?
Actually, I do.
He's perfect. He needs some work, but when I get through with him, he could be your brother.
I don't need him to be my brother, I need him to be *me*!
The man stole my life. I steal his trick.
A brother... a twin. You were Fallon... the whole time?
No. We were both Fallon. And we were both Borden.
Were you - were you the one who went into the box or the one who came back out?
We took turns. The trick is where we would swap.
Cutter knew. Cutter knew. But I told him it was too simple, too easy.
No... simple, maybe, but not easy. There's nothing easy about two men sharing one life.
Wh-What about Olivia? And your wife?
We each loved one of them.
I loved Sarah. He loved Olivia. We each had half a full life, really, which was enough for us. Just... but not for them. You see, sacrifice, Robert - that's the price of a good trick. But you wouldn't know anything about that, would you?
I've - I've made sacrifices.
Yes.
It takes nothing to steal another man's work.
It takes everything.
It took courage... it took courage to climb into that machine every night... not knowing... if I'd be the man in the box... or the prestige. Do you want - want to see. What it cost me? Y-you didn't see where you are, did you? Look. Look
Look here... you went halfway around the world. You spent a fortune. You did terrible things... really terrible things, Robert. And all for nothing.
For nothing?
Yeah.
You never understood... why we did this? The audience knows the truth - the world is simple... and miserable... solid all the way through. But if you could fool them, even for a second, then you can make them wonder. And then you... then you got to see something very special. You really don't know? It was... it was the look on their faces.
My passion is equal to the task.
Where are the wires?
Exactly.
It was the greatest magic trick I've ever seen.
He says that it's even between you.
Even? My wife for a few of his fingers?
He lives his act.
I never thought I'd find an answer at the bottom of a pint glass.
Hasn't stopped you looking, has it?
I haven't had a chance yet to compliment you on your beautiful theatre.
It'll be a lot more beautiful when it's full, Mr Angier.
You settled on a name yet?
Yes, I have. The Great Danton.
Bit old-fashioned isn't it?
No. It's sophisticated.
I thought you said I'd have to get my hands dirty.
Maybe someday you will; I just needed to know that you could.
It won't bring your wife back.
I don't care about my wife. I care about his secret.
I thought they might work for the government.
No?
Worse. They work for Thomas Edison.
What knot did you tie?
I don't know.
You don't know?
You don't *know*?
I thought up a name for you: The Great Danton. Do you like it? It's sophisticated.
It's French.
So what's going to be the climax of our show?
Show? You don't have a show.
I saw you, drop the knot again...?
I think I turned my wrist...
Some nights you just don't get it, do you? I mean, if that knot slips and Julia's on the hoist, she'll break her leg!
It's a wrong knot.
Like I said, the Langfeld Double will hold tighter!
The Langfeld Double isn't a wet knot! It's too dangerous - if the rope swells up, she won't be able to slip it!
I can slip a Langfeld underwater.
She can slip it, we can practice...
Hey, Borden, he said no!
Oh well, you know knots better than me, do you?
Listen! No more mistakes!
Where is he from?
Where are *you* from?
He had a new trick today.
Was it good?
It was the most amazing magic trick I've ever seen.
In my travels, I have seen the future... And it is a strange future indeed. The world, ladies and gentleman, is on the brink of new, terrifying possibilities.
What you are about to witness is not magic. It is purely science. I would like to invite you to come up on stage now so that you can examine the machine for yourselves.
Man's reach exceeds his imagination!
What knot did you tie?
I don't know.

Many of you may be familiar with this technique, but for those of you who aren't, do not be alarmed. What you're about to see is considered safe.
I *have* fallen in love with him, Robert.
Then I know how hard this has been for you.
Why would he trust me?
Because you're going to tell him the truth.
How does he do it?
He uses a double.
No, no, no, no. It's too simple. This is a complex illusion.
You only say that because you don't know the method. It's a double that comes out of the other end, I promise you.
I've seen the show three times now, Mr. Cutter, and the prestige is the same man coming out of the second box.
No, it's not.
It's the same man. He wears gloves to hide his fingers, but if you look closely you can tell."

No. In the aftermath of the battle I went into the temple and I found a baby. Small for a Giant's offspring, abandoned, suffering, left to die. Laufey's son.
Laufey's son?
Yes.
Why? You were knee-deep in Jotun blood. Why would you take me?
You were an innocent child.
No. You took me for a purpose. What was it?... TELL ME!
I thought we could unite our kingdoms one day. Bring about an alliance, bring about permanent peace... through you.
What?
But those plans no longer matter.
So I am no more than another stolen relic, locked up here until you might have use of me?
Why do you twist my words?
You could have told me what I was from the beginning! Why didn't you?
You're my son... I wanted only to protect you from the truth...
What, because I... I... I am the monster parents tell their children about at night?
No! No!
You know, it all makes sense now, why you favored Thor all these years, because no matter how much you claim to love me, you could never have a Frost Giant sitting on the throne of Asgard!
Guards! Guards, please help!
You are a vain, greedy, cruel boy!
And you are an old man and a fool!
Yes... I was a fool, to think you were ready.
Father...
FIE!
Thor Odinson... you have betrayed the express command of your king. Through your arrogance and stupidity, you've opened these peaceful realms and innocent lives to the horror and desolation of war! You are unworthy of these realms, you're unworthy of your title, you're unworthy... of the loved ones you have betrayed! I now take from you your power! In the name of my father and his father before, I, Odin Allfather, cast you out!
I never wanted the throne, I only ever wanted to be your equal!
Loki, this is madness!
Is it madness? Is it? IS IT? I don't know what happened on Earth to make you so soft! Don't tell me it was that woman?... Oh, it was. Well maybe, when we're done here, I'll pay her a visit myself!
I could have done it, Father! I could have done it! For you! For all of us!
No, Loki.
Loki, no... NO!
Why have you done this?
To prove to Father that I am a worthy son! When he wakes, I will have saved his life, I will have destroyed that race of monsters, and I will be true heir to the throne!
You can't kill an entire race!
Why not?... And what is this new found love for the Frost Giants? You, could have killed them all with your bare hands!
I've changed.
So have I. Now fight me!
Kill him.
After all I've done for you?
...So you're the one who showed us the way into Asgard.
That was just a bit of fun, really. To ruin my brother's big day, and to protect the realm from his idiotic rule for a while longer.
I will hear you.
I will conceal you and a handful of your soldiers, lead you into Odin's chambers, and you can slay him where he lies.
Why not kill him yourself?
I suspect that the Asgardians would not take kindly to a king who had murdered his predecessor. Once Odin is dead, I will return the Casket to you...
And you can return Jotunheim to all its, uh... glory.
I... accept.
Look at you. The mighty Thor! With all your strength! And what good does it do you now? Do you hear me, brother? There's nothing you can do!
What are you doing? If you destroy the Bridge, you'll never see her again!
Forgive me, Jane!
Loki. What are you doing here?
I had to see you.
What's happened? Tell me, is it Jotunheim? Let me explain to Father...
Father is dead.
What?
Your banishment, the threat of a new war... it was too much for him to bear. You mustn't blame yourself. I know that you loved him. I tried to tell him so, but he wouldn't listen. It was so cruel to put the hammer within your reach knowing that you could never lift it. The burden of the throne has fallen to me now.
Can I come home?
The truce with Jotunheim is conditional upon your exile.
Yes, but... couldn't we find a way...?
And Mother has forbidden your return. This is goodbye, brother. I'm so sorry.
No. I am sorry. Thank you for coming here.
Farewell.
Goodbye.
""Goodbye?"" I just got back.
The house of Odin is full of traitors...
Do not dishonor my father's name with your lies!
Your father is a murderer and a thief! And why have YOU come, to talk of peace? You long for battle, you crave it! You're nothing more than a boy trying to prove himself a man!
Be warned, this boy grows tired of your mockery!
Thor, stop and think. Look around you, we're outnumbered...
Know your place, brother!
You know not what your actions would unleash... I do. Go now, while I still allow it.
We will accept your most gracious offer. Come on, brother...
Run back home, little princess.
Damn...
Next?
Dr. Selvig.
So, you're the man behind all this? It's quite a labyrinth. I was thinking that you had taken me down here to kill me.
I've been hearing about the New Mexico situation. Your work has impressed a lot of people who are much smarter than I am.
I had a lot to work with: the Foster theory, a gateway to another dimension... it's unprecedented...
...isn't it?
Legend tells us one thing; history, another. But, every now and then, we find something that belongs to both.
What is it?
Power, Doctor. If we figure out how to tap it, maybe unlimited power.
Well, I guess that's worth a look.
Well, I guess that's worth a look.
It's unwise to be in my company right now, brother. Today was to be my day of triumph!
It'll come, in time. If it's any consolation, I think you're right. About the Frost Giants, about Laufey, about everything. If they were able to slip past Asgard's defenses once, who's to say they won't try again? Next time with an army.
Exactly!
There's nothing you can do without defying Father.
No! No, no, no, no! I know that look!
It's the only way to ensure the safety of our borders!
Thor, it's madness!
Loki, you must go to the All-Father and convince him to change his mind.
And if I do, then what? I love Thor more dearly than any of you, but you know what he is. He's arrogant, he's reckless, he's dangerous! You saw how he was today. Is that what Asgard needs from its King?
He may speak for the good of Asgard, but he's always been jealous of Thor!
We should be grateful to him. He saved our lives.
Laufey said, there were traitors in the house of Odin. A master of magic could bring three Jotuns into Asgard.
Loki's always been one for mischief, but you're talking about something else entirely!
Why don't you tell her? How you sent the Destroyer to kill our friends, to kill me!
What?
Well, I must have been enforcing father's last command.
You're a talented liar, brother. Always have been.
It's good to have you back. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to destroy Jotunheim!
Tell me, Loki, how did you lead the Jotuns into Asgard?
Do you think the Bifrost is the only way in and out of this realm? There are passages between worlds to which even you, with all your gifts, are blind. But I have need of them no longer, now that I am king. And I say, for your act of treason, you are relieved of your duties as gatekeeper and no longer citizen of Asgard!
Then I need no longer obey you!
It's said you can still hear and see what transpires around you. I hope it's true, so that you may know your death came at the hand of Laufey.
And YOUR death came by the son of Odin!
I will not fight you, brother!
I'm not your brother! I never was!
Leave this to me. Gatekeeper, we seek...
You're not dressed warmly enough.
I'm sorry?
You think you can deceive me.
You must be mistaken...
Enough! Heimdall, may we pass?
NEVER has an enemy escaped my watch until this day. I want to know how it happened.
And tell no one where we have gone until we return. Understand?
What's the matter, silver tongue turned to lead?
How do I look?
Like a king.
STOP!
Am I cursed?
No.
What am I?
You are my son.
What more than that?
So why did he lie?
He kept the truth from you so you would never feel different. You are our son, Loki, and we your family.
What troubles you, gatekeeper?
I turned my gaze upon you in Jotunheim but could neither see you nor hear you. You were shrouded from me like the Frost Giants that had entered this realm.
Perhaps your senses have weakened after your many years of service.
Or perhaps someone has found a way to hide that which he does not wish me to see.
You have great power, Heimdall. Did Odin fear you?
No.
And why is that?
Because he is my king, and I am sworn to obey him.
He was your king. And you're sworn to obey me now. Yes?
Yes.
Then you'll open the Bifrost to no-one! Until I have repaired the damage that my brother has done!
Ensure my brother does not return. Destroy everything.
Allfather, we must speak with you urgently...
My friends.
Where is Odin?
Father has fallen into the Odinsleep. Mother fears he may never awaken again.
We would speak with her...
She has refused to leave my father's bedside. You can bring your urgent matter to me, your King.
My King, we would ask that you end Thor's banishment.
My first command cannot be to undo the Allfather's last. We're on the brink of war with Jotunheim. Our people need a sense of continuity, in order to feel safe in these difficult times. All of us must stand together, for the good of Asgard.
Yes... of course.
Good. Then you will wait for my word.
If I may, beg the indulgence of your Majesty, to perhaps reconsider...
We're done!
We should never have let him go...
At least he's only banished, not dead. Which is what we'd all be if that guard hadn't told Odin where we'd gone.
How did the guard even know?
I told him.
What?
I told him to go to Odin, after we'd left. He should be flogged for taking so long, we should never have reached Jotunheim...
YOU told the guard?
I saved our lives, and Thor's! I had no idea Father would banish him for what he did.
Thor!
WE MUST GO!
Then go!
We mustn't lose hope that your father will return to us, and your brother...
What hope is there for Thor?
There's always a purpose to everything your father does.
The Casket wasn't the only thing you took from Jotunheim that day, was it?
No. In the aftermath of the battle I went into the temple and I found a baby. Small for a Giant's offspring, abandoned, suffering, left to die. Laufey's son.

Lenny Nero,K,Byronic Hero,"Are we still friends?
I don't know Lenny. You see, friendship is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.
Only he doesn't know about me and Faith. So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else. And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase. So to buy time, I do the skank. I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall. And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times.
And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.
No plan is perfect, Lenny. Hey, cheer up. World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway.
See... I can get you what you want, I can. I can get you anything, you just have to talk to me, you have to trust me. You can trust me, 'cause I'm your priest, I'm your shrink... I am your main connection to the switchboard of the soul. I'm the magic man... Santa Claus of the subconscious. You say it, you think it, you can have it.
I can't believe you had to give them the damn tape.
Yeah I know. It was one of my favorites: me and Faith in the hot tub on my birthday.
Are we impressed yet?
Yeah... pretty impressed.
You're a disappointment, Nero. But you know what disappoints me more?
Your sex life?
Look... everyone needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometimes, it's what we are.
I can use this, it's not bad, but, listen honey, you've got to move your eyes slower next time, much much slower. Like... like you're making love with your eyes, ok?
You're some piece of work, Lenny Nero. You're just calmly backstroking along in the big toilet bowl and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between working vice and your current so-called occupation, you must have seen every kind of perversion. But you're just like... some teflon man, you still come out this goofball romantic.
It's my sword and my shield, Mace.
This is not like ""TV-only-better""... this is life.
Right now his frontal lobes are like two runny eggs.

Oooh... a little B&E; action.

911 is busy!
Nero.
Strickland.
Commissioner Strickland!
See, since you shit-canned my career, I don't even have to call you sir. One of life's small pleasures.
This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe... it's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.
Two million years of human evolution and that's the best idea you can come up with.
Bullet-resistant? What ever happened to bullet-proof?
This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
you ready?
Yeah, boot it.
Hey, Lenny, we made it!
Yea, we did.
You should get going.
Yea, see you downtown.
See you there.
She said ""THEY"" - ""If They get me"" - ""THEY"". Which means this whole, like, random sex-killer thing is bullshit, which means somebody whacked her for a reason
So this guy's not a Psycho?
No, Macy, he's a psycho. To do what's on that tape?... He's not a well-adjusted human being
Lenny, would you relax? We're not being followed. Stop being so paranoid
The guy had a knife, to my throat, in my Living room. Relaxing might be right out, OK?"
Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting,K,Byronic Hero,"Here's the thing. I don't give a tuppenny fuck about your moral conundrum, you meat-headed shit-sack. That's more or less the thing. And I want you to go out there... You, nobody else. None of your little minions. I want you to go out there. And I want you to punish the person who's responsible for murdering this poor little rabbit. Is that understood?
How old are you, Amsterdam?
I'm not sure, sir. I never did quite figure it.
I'm forty-seven. Forty-seven years old. You know how I stayed alive this long? All these years? Fear. The spectacle of fearsome acts. Somebody steals from me, I cut off his hands. He offends me, I cut out his tongue. He rises against me, I cut off his head, stick it on a pike, raise it high up so all on the streets can see. That's what preserves the order of things. Fear.
You see this knife? I'm gonna teach you to speak English with this fucking knife!
At my challenge, by the ancient laws of combat, we are met at this chosen ground, to settle for good and all who holds sway over the five points: us natives, born rightwise to this fine land, or the foreign hordes defiling it.
Yeah.
By the ancient laws of combat, I accept the challenge of the so called ""natives."" They plague our people at every turn, but from this day out, they shall plague us no more. For let it be known, that the hand that tries to strike us from this land shall be swiftly cut down.
YEAH.
He was the only man I ever killed worth remembering.
WOOPSY DAISY!
You killed an elected official?
Who elected him?
You don't know what you've done to yourself.
I know your works. You are neither cold nor hot. So because you are lukewarm, I will spew you out of my mouth. You can build your filthy world without me. I took the father. Now I'll take the son. You tell young Vallon I'm gonna paint Paradise Square with his blood. Two coats. I'll festoon my bedchamber with his guts. As for you, Mr. Tammany-fucking-Hall, you come down to the Points again, and you'll be dispatched by my own hand. Get back to your celebration and let me eat in peace.
You mother-whoring Irish nigger.
You. Whatever your name is... what is your name?
Amsterdam, sir.
Amsterdam... I'm New York... don't you never come in here empty handed again, you gotta pay for the pleasure of my company.
Thank God. I die a true American.
Mulberry Street... and Worth... Cross and Orange... and Little Water. Each of the Five Points is a finger. When I close my hand it becomes a fist. And, if I wish, I can turn it against you.
Burn him, see if his ashes turn green.
The Priest and me, we lived by the same principles. It was only faith divided us. He gave me this, you know? That was the finest beating I ever took. My face was pulp. My guts was pierced, my ribs was all mashed up. And when he came to finish me, I couldn't look him in the eye. He spared me, because he wanted me to live in shame. This was a great man. A great man. So I out out the eye that looked away, I sent it to him wrapped in blue paper. I would've cut them both out if I could have fought him blind. And I rose back up again with a full heart... and buried him in his own blood. He was the only man I ever killed worth remembering.
Is this it priest, the Pope's new army, a few crusty bitches and a hand full of rag tags?
Now, now, Bill, you swore this was a battle between warriors, not a bunch of miss nancies, so warriors is what I brought.
A *real* native is someone who is willing to die fighting for his country. There's nothing more to it.
You may or may not know, Bill, that everyday I go down to the waterfront with hot soup for the Irish as they come ashore. Its part of building a political base.
I've noticed you there, you may have noticed me.
Indeed I have. Throwing torrents of abuse to every single person who steps off those boats.
If only I had the guns, Mr. Tweed, I'd shoot each and every one of them before they set foot on American soil.
Everything you see belongs to me, to one degree or another. The beggars and newsboys and quick thieves here in Paradise, the sailor dives and gin mills and blind tigers on the waterfront, the anglers and amusers, the she-hes and the Chinks. Everybody owes, everybody pays. Because that's how you stand up against the rising of the tide.
That's the building of our country right there, Mr. Cutting. Americans aborning.
I don't see no Americans. I see trespassers, Irish harps. Do a job for a nickel what a nigger does for a dime and a white man used to get a quarter for. What have they done? Name one thing they've contributed.
Votes.
Votes, you say? They vote how the archbishop tells them, and who tells the archbishop? Their king in the pointy hat what sits on his throne in Rome.
I killed the last honorable man, 15 years ago. Since then it's... You seen his portrait downstairs?
Mm-hmm.
'S your mouth all glued-up with cunny juice? I asked you a question!
I said I *seen* it, sir.
Oh, you got a murderous streak in you!
I took the father, now I'll take the son.
That's a fine locket. I'll give you a dollar for it.
It was me mother's...
Dollar and a half?
Done.
Challenge.
Challenge accepted.
We hold in our hearts the memory of our fallen brothers whose blood stains the very streets we walk today. Also on this night we pay tribute to the leader of our enemies, an honorable man, who crossed over bravely, fighting for what he believed in. To defeat my enemy, I extinguish his life, and consume him as I consume these flames. In honor of Priest Vallon.
That, my friends, is the minority vote.
Ears and noses will be the trophies of the day. But no hand shall touch him.
This is a night for Americans!
Is this the Pope's new army?
My father gave his life, making this country what it is. Murdered by the British with all of his men on the twenty fifth of July, anno domini, 1814. Do you think I'm going to help you befoul his legacy, by giving this country over to them, what's had no hand in the fighting for it? Why, because they come off a boat crawling with lice and begging you for soup.
I'm paid to uphold the law.
What in Heaven's name are you talking about?
Civilization is crumbling
Bill, I can't get a days work done for all the good citizens coming in here to harass me about crime in the Points. Some even go so far as to accuse Tammany of connivance in this so-called rampant criminality. What am I to do? I can't have this. Something has to be done.
What do you have in mind?
I don't know. I think maybe we should hang someone.
Who?
No one important, necessarily. Average men will do. Back alley amusers with no affiliations.
How many?
Three or four.
Which?
Four.
Well draw it mildly son. Happy Jack don't fill his lungs without I tell him he may do so.
He ain't earned a death! He ain't a death at my hands! No, he'll walk amongst you marked with shame, a freak worthy of Barnum's Museum of Wonders. God's only man, spared by the Butcher.
Hey, have you met Amsterdam? He almost fish-hooked McGloin.
Anything in your pockets?
I ain't started working yet.
Don't mind him. He used to be an Irishman.
It's Election Day.
Look to me! Who is this under my knife!
You're a good one for the fighting, Bill. But you can't fight forever.
I can go down doing it.
And you will!
What did you say?
I said, you're turning your back on the future.
Not our future.
Careful, Tweedy. The Mort's Frenchified.
Now that you've had a taste of my mutton, how do you like it?
Pistols?
No pistols.
Good boy.
Whose man are you?
Oranges, delicious. What a peach! You should put her on the stage.
He knows my name!
He prides himself on knowing.
On the seventh day the Lord rested, but before that he did, he squatted over the side of England and what came out of him... was Ireland. No offense son.
Nah, none taken, sir. I grew up here. All I ever knew of Ireland was from the talk of the others at the orphan asylum.
And which part of that excrementitious isle where your forebears spawned?
I've been told Kerry, I lost proof of it in my language at the asylum."
Elisabeth Burrows,AZ,Ophelia,"You want what they want, don't you... I'll never tell. I'll never tell... Any of you.
Where are we going?"
Crazy Cora,AZ,Ophelia,"You know, if we're lost, you can tell me.
We're lost.
I can take bad news. Just tell me straight.
I don't know where the hell we are.
No sense takin' time to make it sound better than it is.
I reckon we're goin' in circles.
Wire things up and I'll see right through. So, just tell me honestly. Are we lost?
Nope. I know exactly where we are.
That's good, 'cause, frankly, I was gettin' a little worried.
Don't worry, on a new job it's quite common for things not to go well at first.
I don't want you to go.
You sure look pretty in that new blue dress.
If you go after Marston, he'll kill you.
Kid, next time she talks like that, pee all over the dress.
Things seem different here. They say God made Australia last, don't you know, after he got tired of making everything else the same.
Well, I seen some pretty country, that's for certain.
I remember once my Granddaddy told me how, when you're lost in the desert, you should sleep during the day and walk at night.
Your Granddaddy tell you that? Did he also tell you we'll die, in the the desert, without those horses?
Well, what good are horses, if we die of thirst?
Once in a while she actually makes a little sense.
What did you say, Roy?
Never mind.
What's my name today?
Matthew Quigley, same as any other day.
How's about you and me taking off all our clothes and go swimmin'?
What are you crazy? There ain't no water
Why *shame* on you!
Well you? Well, what about last night? You...
I what?
Oh, never mind.
Anyone who believes in magic is crazy.
I don't eat things that are still movin'.
Gonna shoot it first?"
Justine,AZ,Ophelia,"I smile, and I smile, and I smile.
The earth is evil. We don't need to grieve for it.
What?
Nobody will miss it.
But where would Leo grow?
All I know is, life on earth is evil.
Then maybe life somewhere else.
But there isn't.
How do you know?
Because I know things.
Oh yes, you always imagined you did.
I know we're alone.
I don't think you know that at all.
678. The bean lottery. Nobody guessed the amount of beans in the bottle.
No, that's right.
But I know. 678.
Well, perhaps. But what does that prove?
That I know things. And when I say we're alone, we're alone. Life is only on earth, and not for long.
Life is only on Earth. And not for long.
Hold my hand. Close your eyes.
You'd better be goddamn happy.
Yes, I should be. I really should be.
Do you have any idea how much this party cost me? A ballpark figure?
No. I don't. Should I?
Yes, I think you should. A great deal of money. A huge amount of money. In fact for most people, an arm and a leg.
I hope you feel it's well spent.
Well, that depends whether or not we have a deal.
A deal?
Yes, a deal. That you be happy.
Yes, of course. Of course we have a deal.
I was just thinking - what if instead we try and sell you to the public, Jack? Well then, surprisingly, I'd arrive right back where I started from - at nothing.
""Nothing."" It's not such a bad tagline, Jack.
Would my newly pledged A.D. please expand a little on her thoughts of the tagline?
Nothing is too much for you, Jack. I hate you and your firm so deeply I couldn't find the words to describe it. You are a despicable power-hungry little man, Jack.
Is that a resignation? Because they aren't too many jobs out there, I tell you.
You want to meet on the terrace, and sip wine, the three of us?
It would make me happy.
Do you know what I think of your plan?
No. I was hoping that you might like it.
I think it's a piece of shit.
Please, Justine. I just want it to be nice...
Nice? Why don't we meet on the fucking toilet?
Fine, then - let's not...
You're damn right let's not!
I really hate you sometimes...
This could have been a lot different.
Yes. But, Michael... what did you expect?
You know what I think of your plan. I think that it's a piece of shit.
But I tried, Claire.
You did. I know you did.
It tastes like ashes!
Dad says there's nothing to do then. Nowhere to hide.
If your dad said that, then he's forgotten about something. He's forgotten about the magic cave.
The way I see it, you're now short of a boss and a husband, could I, in all humility, offer my services? You have the ideas. I have the head for business. We could be the perfect couple. We've had good sex.
I don't think that's a very good idea.
No. No.
I'm frightened, Mom. I have trouble walking properly.
You can still wobble, I see. So just wobble the hell out of here. Stop dreaming, Justine.
I'm scared.
We all are, sweetie. Just forget it. Get the hell out of here.
I know things.
Sir. Eh...
Yeah, you're good. You can back up a little more, if you want. I think you need the... I think you need that extra...
I don't think he can hear you.
Sir. Sir, can you hear me up there?
Do you copy, sailor? He's in a different county, I think that's...

Too bad about Tim.
What about Tim?
That he got fired. he didn't last many hours in the business, but then again, it's a rather unpredictable one. You're a king one day and beggar the next.
So, you go right back to wherever you came from, right, buddy?
I'm happy that you're happy."
Gina Montana,AZ,Ophelia,"I like Fernando. He's a fun guy and he's nice... and he knows how to treat a woman.
Knows how to treat a woman? By taking you to the toilet to make out?
You can't tell me what to do, Tony. No more. I am not a baby anymore. I'll do what I wanna do. I'll see whoever I wanna see. And if I wanna fuck 'em, Tony, then I'll fuck 'em!"
Jane Olsen,AZ,Ophelia,"Jane, I love you - when will you marry me?
We who are of noble blood may not follow the wishes of our hearts."
John Robie,AK,Gentleman Thief,"Danielle, you are just a girl. She is a woman.
Why buy an old car if you can get a new one cheaper? It will run better and last longer.
You want a leg or a breast?
You make the choice.
Say something nice to her, Danielle.
She looks a lot older up close.
To a mere child, anything over twenty might seem old.
A child? Shall we stand in shallower water and discuss that?
You're here in Europe to buy a husband.
The man I want doesn't have a price.
That eliminates me.
I have a feeling that tonight you're going to see one of the Riviera's most fascinating sights.
I was talking about the fireworks!
I never doubted it.
The way you looked at my necklace, I didn't know...
Even in this light, I can tell where your eyes are looking.
Look, John. Hold them. Diamonds... The only thing in the world you can't resist. Then tell me you don't know what I'm talking about.
Ever had a better offer in your whole life? One with everything?
I've never had a crazier one.
Just as long as you're satisfied!
You know as well as I do: this necklace is imitation.
Well, I'm not.
Miss Stevens?
Yes, Mr. Burns?
You know what I think?
About what?
You.
I don't really care.
Why don't you own a place like this?
Palaces are for royalty. We're just common people with a bank account.
For what it's worth, I never stole from anybody who would go hungry.
Doesn't it make you nervous to be in the same room with thousands of dollars worth of diamonds, and unable to touch them?
No.
Like an alcoholic outside of a bar on Election Day?
Wouldn't know the feeling.
I called the police from your room and told them who you are and everything you've been doing tonight.
Everything? The boys must have really enjoyed *that* at headquarters!
Not only did I enjoy that kiss last night, I was awed by its efficiency.
I only regret one thing.
That you never asked me to marry you?
No, that I ever took the time to teach you English.
How many did you kill?
72. But, I know something that'll please you: none of them were insured.
Danielle, do me a favor. Don't call me a cat.
I only do one favor a day.

Will you do as your father here asks?
Did I brush your fur the wrong way?
I've never caught a jewel thief before. It's stimulating. It's like... It's like...
Like sitting in a hot tub?
May I ask you a personal question?
I've been hoping you would.
I'm in love with you.
Now that's a ridiculous thing to say.
What do you say?
My only comment would be highly censorable.
You are a man of obvious good taste in everything. Why did you...
Why did I take up stealing? To live better, to own things I couldn't afford, to acquire this good taste that you now enjoy and which I should be very reluctant to give up.
Then you are frankly dishonest.
I try to be.
The pastries are light as air.
Germaine has very sensitive hands and an exceedingly light touch. She strangled a German general - without a sound.
Well, we only met a couple of minutes ago.
That's right, only a few minutes ago.
Only a few minutes ago? And you talk like old friends...
Ah, well, that's warm, friendly France for you.
Why do you think we moved so often? Your father was a swindler, dear, but a lovable one. If you ask me, this one's a bigger operator on every level.
Thank you, madam.
John, why bother?
It's sort of a hobby of mine - the truth.
You don't have to spend every day of your life proving your honesty, but I do."
Sir Charles Lytton,AK,Gentleman Thief,"If I were my father, I'd have you tortured.
No. If you were your father, I doubt very much if I would have kissed you.
If I'm not being too nosy your highness, I read somewhere there was some dispute over the ownership of the Pink Panther.
It belongs to me. It was a gift from my late father. I shall never surrender it.
Why should you?
When the present government seized power, they claimed the diamond was the property of the people. There's even some talk of the international court deciding the issue.
I'll tell you what, why don't I steal the diamond, leave that old glove or whatever it is behind, and you and I can split the insurance.
All right.
I feel like dancing.
Your Highness?
I'd love to.
How about you, Madame?
Yes, of course.
Your leg is better, Sir. Charles?
What?
I say your leg is better.
Oh, yes. Much better. Thank you.
You know, Mr. Tucker...
Argh!
That's my beer, old man.
Hi George. Any idea how we get out of here?
I don't know. I've been all over this place. I've been up this street, up that one, up that one. How are we gonna get out here?
Why don't you try the high road up there?
Okay. I'll take the high road, you take the low road. So long, Uncle Charles.
Ciao, George.
I am willing to bet you ten thousand francs, that the phantom is in Cortina at this very moment. Even, perhaps, in this very room.
How exciting. What do you think, Mr. Tucker?
Oh, I agree with the inspector. You see, Ten of his last fifteen victims have been guests at Angela Dunning's parties.
What are we all talking about?
The notorious Phantom.
I'm afraid I never heard of him.
From the little I've read about him, he seems to be quite a fellow.
Believe me. There are few thieves who are as clever as the Phantom. Each theft is completely different and unique, classic in its conception.
I thought you were working on the theory that he does repeat himself.
Well, only as far as Angela Dunning's parties are concerned. However, there is one other duplication, but that is his ah... trademark, his calling card, so to speak. He always leaves a white monogrammed glove.
Sounds terribly theatrical.
Come back. It's me."
Neil McCauley,AK,Gentleman Thief,"My life's a disaster zone. I got a stepdaughter so fucked up because her real father's this large-type asshole. I got a wife, we're passing each other on the down-slope of a marriage - my third - because I spend all my time chasing guys like you around the block. That's my life.
A guy told me one time, ""Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner."" Now, if you're on me and you gotta move when I move, how do you expect to keep a... a marriage?
What are you doing?
What am I doing? I'm talking to an empty telephone.
I don't understand.
'Cause there is a dead man on the other end of this fuckin' line
Told you I'm never going back...
Yeah.
You know, we are sitting here, you and I, like a couple of regular fellas. You do what you do, and I do what I gotta do. And now that we've been face to face, if I'm there and I gotta put you away, I won't like it. But I tell you, if it's between you and some poor bastard whose wife you're gonna turn into a widow, brother, you are going down.
There is a flip side to that coin. What if you do got me boxed in and I gotta put you down? Cause no matter what, you will not get in my way. We've been face to face, yeah. But I will not hesitate. Not for a second.
You travel a lot?
Yeah.
Traveling makes you lonely?
I'm alone, I am not lonely.
So you never wanted a regular type life?
What the fuck is that? Barbeques and ballgames?
I do what I do best, I take scores. You do what you do best, try to stop guys like me.
What are you, a monk?
I have a woman.
What do you tell her?
I tell her I'm a salesman.
So then, if you spot me coming around that corner... you just gonna walk out on this woman? Not say good bye?
That's the discipline.
That's pretty vacant, you know.
Yeah, it is what it is. It's that or we both better go do something else, pal.
I don't know how to do anything else.
Neither do I.
I don't much want to either.
Neither do I.
Seven years in Folsom. In the hole for three. McNeil before that. McNeil as tough as they say?
You lookin' to become a penologist?
You lookin' to go back? You know, I chased down some crews; guys just lookin' to fuck up, get busted back. That you?
You must've worked some dipshit crews.
I worked all kinds.
You see me doin' thrill-seeker liquor store holdups with a ""Born to Lose"" tattoo on my chest?
No, I do not.
Right. I am never goin' back.
Then don't take down scores.
He knew the risks, he didn't have to be there. It rains... you get wet.
Don't move! Don't fuckin' move! Put your hands in the air! Put your hands in the air! Put 'em up!
Get on your knees! Get on your knees!
We want to hurt no one! We're here for the bank's money, not your money. Your money is insured by the federal government, you're not gonna lose a dime! Think of your families, don't risk your life. Don't try and be a hero!
I don't even know what I'm doing anymore. I know life is short, whatever time you get is luck. You want to walk? You walk right now. Or on your own... on your own you choose to come with me. And all I know is... all I know is there's no point in me going anywhere anymore if it's going to be alone... without you.
L.A.P.D. Gee, what, where the fuck did this heat come from?
Maybe it's the score they were onto, the place, not us. 'Cause it's been hit a couple of times, you know, or something?
Assume they got our phones, assume they got our houses, assume they got us, right here, right now as we sit, everything. Assume it all.
Charlene's gonna leave me.
Why?
Not enough steaks in the freezer.
When are you gonna get some furniture?
When I get around to it.
Gimme the key!
What key?
Don't move! Sit there. Sit there! Let it bleed.
I have one where I'm drowning. And I gotta wake myself up and start breathing or I'll die in my sleep.
You know what that's about?
Yeah. Having enough time.
Enough time? To do what you wanna do?
That's right.
You doin' it now?
No, not yet.
Take off your shirt.
What?
Take off your shirt.
My - my God - my daughter gave it to me for Father's Day...
I don't give a shit who gave it to you, take it off!
you live in this neighborhood?
No, I live above Sunset Plaza, it's a little house I rent and it's a little rundown but has a beautiful view, what about you?
I live in Venice Boulevard, where's your family originally from?
We're Scots Irish, they immigrated to America in the late seventeen hundreds, where are you originally from?
Bay area.
Are your folks there?
My mother died a long time ago I don't know where my father is. I have a brother somewhere but sounds like you have a tight family I can tell. In L.A. the city of lights, in Fuji they have these iridescent algae that come out once a year in the water, it looks like L.A. at night.
You've been there?
No, I'm going there some day.
When are you gonna get a lady?
When I get around to it.
Anyone want some pie?
I gotta go use the john.

I had to get it on. He was making a move. *I had to get it on.*


Split's in the car. Took it out of ours, evenly. To make up for his full end. Because I want to pay off and get rid of this motherfucker right now.



HOLD IT!


Chris. Hey - Chris. Listen to me. Nate's gonna pick you up. He's gonna take you to his place.
Where's Charlene?
We gotta get outta here. We're all over the six o'clock news. We gotta get outta here.
I'm not going with... out her.
Think about that. I will meet you at Nate's.
Where're you going?
I gotta find out if our out got spilled along with every other damn thing.
Who did it?
Who wasn't there? Trejo. - I'll see you at Nate's.

Look at me. *Look at me!*

Look at me!




What happened out there?
Don't ask...
Don't move. Don't fuckin' move. Put your hands in the air. Put your hands in the air. Put 'em up.
Here we go.
211! 211! We're being held up!
211, armored car...
There's the call. Three minutes.
Clear!
80 seconds left!
Get back. Get back!
Hey slick, see that shit comin' outta their ears? They can't fucking hear you! Cool it!
All right guys! Let's go!
You had to fuck with me.
You wanna fuck with me?
Who was that guy?
Nobody.
Who was that guy?
Nobody.
Who is he?
His a broker from Las Vegas
Chris is going to straighten it up with you.
It's too late I'm sick of it.
SHUT UP, here's the deal: You'll give Chris one last shot. If he fucks up, I'll finance setting you up any way you want. Dominick too; and my word counts, but you will give him the shot. Now clean up and go home.
Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner.
yeah?
security, there's a fire on three, we have to evacuate all floors.
I can't leave here
look, why don't we just talk about this a bit, brother?
And I am double the worst trouble you ever had.
Our problem is take the bank or split right now, do not go home, do not pack, nothing. 30 secs flat from now we are gone on our separate ways, that's it...

what the hell happens to Van Zant's seven fifty?
With the heat we got now you want to play world war two in the streets with Van Zant?
No I want my seven fifty he gets a pass?
I got more motivation to whack Van Zant than either of you right now he is a fucking luxury
I'll roll with you Neil whatever
No not on this one, on this one you're on your own
You figure this is the best thing to do?
I got plans I'm going away after this for me the reward is worth the stretch but Elaine takes good care of you, you got plenty put away, T-Bonds real estate if I were you I would be smart, I'd cut loose of this
What is it?
It's a bank, the depot's cash for distribution on Thursdays to the other branches to cover Friday's payroll checks so on Thursday's the command branch has got a full whack
On the prowl or strong?
Strong through the front door
How many guys?
Four or three plus a driver, you walk in you knock the guards over and you walk out,
You want a hundred advance plus ten percent cut for that? Sounds like an address to a ""cowboy score"" they hit the holdup alarms I've got to get out before the cops show, what that is that?
They have three multiple alarm systems ,two teller codes and a cellular but the signals aren't going anywhere because the night before you cut in and trick out the alarm system's computer to turn itself and the video recorders off twenty minutes before you walk in the door
What about architectural and electrical engineering plans?

I've seen you in the book store from time to time, I work there, if you don't want to talk to me that's ok, I'm sorry I bothered you
I didn't mean to be rude. I didn't recognize you. I work in metals I'm a salesman, you like working there?
Sure, I get a discount there's a whole section of books in my area.
What area is that?
Graphic design, the store's a day job until I got enough going.

You go to school for that?
Yeah I went to Parsons
Where's that?
New York City
How long you've been here?

I'm not good at meeting people.
You met me, take off with me for a while
Where are we going?

When?
I have to separately but you'll meet me there.
What about my job?
You don't need money I got plenty, you could set up a studio and do work there
I don't know.
What's there to know?
Are you married?
What?
You come and go.
Last thing I am is married. I'm a needle starting at zero, and all of a sudden someone like you comes along.
You don't know me.
I know enough come with me.
What's wrong?
Nothing's wrong everything's right, will you go?

So, how is he?
His got blood loss and shock, so I'll give him some morphine for the pain.
What's the bottom line?
It's mostly tissue damage which is good but his clavicle is fractured, can he rest for a while?
Six to seven hours.
That's it?
That's it.
Who did this?
They made me
Who?
Waingro
Waingro, on his own?
No, with the guy his working for, Van Zant.

Malibu Equity Investments
They run investment portfolio for offshore drug money
What'd we got?
We ripped off his bearer bonds
His got insurance.
That's the point, he collects a hundred percent from the insurance, he is a ""player"" and maybe buys his bonds back from us for sixty percent of their value make forty percent on top of the hundred percent but instead of selling it back to him we sell it out on the street that's an extra three hundred thousand to you.
Try it on.
Right now I want you to sit on the floor and put your hands on your head, anybody feels sick, anybody got heart trouble, go ahead and lean against the wall.
Waingro, where is he?
Where is he?
How the hell would I know?

I bought it.
Good, I told you his legit.
As I was saying, that's not really an estimate, those are exact figures. I got a record of the cash flow to this bank for the past two months.
how do you get this information?
It comes to you, this stuff just flies through the air, they send this information ""beamed"" out over the fucking place, you just got to know how to grab it, see, I know how to grab it.

clean up, go home"
Rodney Skinner,"AK, AV","Gentleman Thief, Loveable Rogue","I've been waiting all week to do that.
Get a grip, man.
Well, I thought I just did.
Oooh, Mina...
Report.
Well, hello to you, too. And need I remind you, I am naked in the snow. I can't feel any of my extremities. And I mean... any of them.
So, how did M get you?
None of your business.
You're a little testy, Mr. Q.
Mrs. Harker, I doubt if you measure danger the way I do.
And I imagine you with quite the library, Mr. Quatermain. All those books you must have read merely by looking at their covers.
I've had women along on past exploits, and found them to be, at best, a distraction.
Do I distract you?
My dear girl, I've buried two wives and many lovers... and I'm in no mood for more of either.
You can send 'em my way.
Skinner, shut up.
That's the last time I ever play with matches.
And they'll provide an antidote... well, that's if I'm a good boy.
And are you a good boy?
I guess you'll find out, won't you?
This is a charming spot. Does Jack the Ripper live here?
Oh, chemist, eh? Do we get to blow something up, then?
OW. You scratched me.
Better me than him.
Are you okay?
That's the last time I play with matches!
Allow me to introduce myself. Rodney Skinner, gentleman thief. Now, I thought invisibility would be a boon to my work. Well, you can imagine, it was my undoing. Once you're invisible, it's bloody hard to turn back.
And I thought I was special. You're invulnerable to harm.
I don't like to boast.
I've been waiting all week to do that.
Get a grip, man.

Nick Wells,AK,Gentleman Thief,"Nice working with you, ace. Okay, bye-bye.
You want my advice? Make a list of everything you want now and spend the next twenty five years getting it, slowly, piece by piece.
After this no more jobs. This is the last one I'm doing. I'm quitting for good.
Yeah? How many times have you told me that in twenty-fie years. I mean, I'm gonna believe that when the pigs eat my brother, right?
I've never seen anything like that! What do you have in mind?
I don't know, but if somebody built it, somebody can unbuild it.
In all the years you've been doing this, what's the biggest gamble you ever took? On job, the biggest long shot?
I don't take long shots and I never have
I know you're careful, I'm careful too, that's not what I mean, when you were starting out you must've taken some ""flyers"" here and there, did something that was a little wild, I'm just curious
You're smart, talented and you know a few things but talent means nothing in this game if you don't make the right choices, there's plenty of talented people that never see the light of day anymore, this whole thing takes discipline because it's one big long shot and if you don't have the discipline to stay away from the"" flyers"", the ""gambles"", or whatever else you want to call a stupid move, then one day you will go down it's inevitable
So did you make it out?
Fuck you."
Khan Noonien Singh,BF,Revenge,"Khan, you bloodsucker! You're going to have to do your own dirty work now! Do you hear me? Do you?
Kirk? Kirk, you're still alive, my old friend?
Still, ""old friend""! You've managed to kill just about everyone else, but like a poor marksman, you keep missing the target!
Perhaps I no longer need to try, Admiral.
Oh, no! Let go! He can't take it...!
Khan... Khan, you've got Genesis, but you don't have me. You were going to kill me, Khan. You're going to have to come down here. You're going to have to come down here!
I've done far worse than kill you. I've hurt you. And I wish to go on hurting you. I shall leave you as you left me, as you left her; marooned for all eternity in the center of a dead planet... buried alive! Buried alive...!
KHAAANNNN!
KHAAANNNN!
To the last, I will grapple with thee... from Hell's heart, I stab at thee! For hate's sake, I spit my last breath at thee!
We're all with you, sir. But, consider this. We are free. We have a ship, and the means to go where we will. We have escaped permanent exile on Ceti Alpha V. You have defeated the plans of Admiral Kirk. You do not need to defeat him again.
He tasks me. He tasks me and I shall have him! I'll chase him 'round the moons of Nibia and 'round the Antares Maelstrom and 'round perdition's flames before I give him up!
They're still running with shields down.
Of course! We are one big, happy fleet! Ah, Kirk, my old friend, do you know the Klingon proverb that tells us revenge is a dish that is best served cold?
It is very cold in space!
Captain, Captain, Captain... save your strength. These people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he never told you the tale? To amuse your Captain, no? Never told you how the Enterprise picked up the Botany Bay, lost in space from the year 1996 with myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
I never even met Admiral Kirk.
'Admiral?' 'Admiral!' 'Admiral'... Never told you how 'Admiral' Kirk sent seventy of us into exile in this barren sandheap with only the contents of these cargo bays to sustain us?
You lie! On Ceti Alpha Five there was life! A fair chance...
THIS IS CETI ALPHA FIVE! Ceti Alpha Six exploded six months after we were left here. The shock shifted the orbit of this planet and everything was laid waste. 'Admiral' Kirk never bothered to check on our progress. It was only the fact of my genetically-engineered intellect that allowed us to survive. On Earth, two hundred years ago, I was a prince with power over millions...
Captain Kirk was your host. You repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him!
This is Admiral Kirk. We tried it once your way, Khan, are you game for a rematch? Khan, I'm laughing at the ""superior intellect.""
Full impulse power!
No, sir! You have Genesis! You can have whatever...
FULL POWER! DAMN YOU!
You see, their young enter through the ears and wrap themselves around the cerebral cortex. This has the effect of rendering the victim extremely susceptible to suggestion. Later, as they grow, follows madness and death.
Khan, listen to me...
These are pets, of course. Not quite domesticated.
Joachim?
Yours... is... superior...
I shall avenge you.
Let them eat static.
They still haven't raised their shields.
Raise ours.
Their shields are going up.
Lock phasers on target.
Locking phasers on target.
They're locking phasers.
Raise shields!
Fire!
Surely, I have made my meaning plain. I mean to avenge myself upon you, Admiral. I deprived your ship of power, and when I swing around, I mean to deprive you of your life.
Our shields are dropping.
Then raise them!
I can't!
The override. Where's the override?
There she is! There she is! Ah... not so wounded as we were led to believe. So much the better!
Sir, I demand...
You are in a position to demand *nothing*. I, on the other hand, am in a position to *grant* nothing.
Khan!
You still remember, Admiral. I cannot help but be touched. I, of course, remember you.
Khan, how do I know you'll keep your word?
Oh, I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative."
Col. Douglas Mortimer,BF,Revenge,"Ten thousand... twelve thousand... fifteen... sixteen... seventeen... twenty-two. Twenty-two?
...Twenty-seven.
Any trouble, boy?
No, old man. Thought I was having trouble with my adding. It's all right now.
Tell me, Colonel... Were you ever young?
Yup. And just as reckless as you. Then one day, something happened. It made life very precious to me.
What's that?
Or is the question indiscreet?
No. No, the question isn't indiscreet. But the answer could be.
Well well, if it isn't the smoker. Well... Remember me, amigo?
M-Mm.
'Course you do. El Paso.
It's a small world.
Yes, and very, very bad. Now come on, you light another match.
I generally smoke just after I eat. Why don't you come back in about ten minutes?
Ten minutes you'll be smoking in hell. *Get up!*
Hey, Mister, you just can't pull the emergency cord and jump off! Tell me, why did you stop that train? If you wanna get off, you're...
Well, the railroad company would might be pleased to make any arrangements for any passenger, if you wanna get off, Dear Sir.
I did get off. Thanks.
One from the outside one from the inside.There's no other way.One of us will have to join Indio's gang.
Why did you look at me when you said one of us?
Because they don't know you.Wild sees me and his hump will catch on fire.
Tell me Colonel.How do you propose that I join up with Indio?Maybe bring him a bunch of roses.
When two hunters go after the same prey, they usually end up shooting each other in the back. And we don't want to shoot each other in the back.
Then the Colonel dies...
There seems to be a family resemblance.
Here.
Naturally, between brother and sister.
How can somebody in my business go around with a contraption like this?
That contraption almost sent you to your grave.
Tickets. Tickets, please. Tickets. Tickets. Thank you. Tickets.
Is this part of Tucumcari?
We should pass there in about 3 to 4 minutes.
Thanks.
Well, eh, excuse me, but you made a mistake, Reverend. I couldn't help hearing you're going to Tucumcari. I sell goods around here, and I gotta tell you, you're on the wrong train. I think the nearest stop to Tucumcari is Amarillo. By getting off at Santa Fe and returning by way of Amarillo, you should be able to get right where... you're... going.

Er, you see the train doesn't stop at Tucumcari.
This train'll stop at Tucumcari...
And you will wait a month to get your share.
Naturally!... I'll be in the tavern.
I was worried about you - all alone, with so many problems to solve...
My boy, you've become rich.
You mean *we've* become rich, old man.
No, it's all yours. I think you deserve it.
What about our partnership?
Maybe next time.
Take it to the station.The gentleman's leaving.
Hold it.Take it back.
Take it to the station.
Go inside.
The station.
You mind telling me how you got here?
I just reasoned it out. I figured you'd tell Indio to do just exactly the opposite of what we agreed, and he's suspicious enough to figure out something else. Since El Paso was out of the question, well, here I am!
To try robbing us would be so futile that only a complete fool would attempt it.
Yeah.Or a complete madman.
Indio!Listen to me.This is Colonel Mortimer.Douglas Mortimer.Does the name mean anything to you!
Leave Indio to me.
Alright."
Leonard,BF,Revenge,"We all lie to ourselves to be happy.
OK, so what am I doing?
Oh, I'm chasing this guy.
No... he's chasing me.
I have to believe in a world outside my own mind. I have to believe that my actions still have meaning, even if I can't remember them. I have to believe that when my eyes are closed, the world's still there. Do I believe the world's still there? Is it still out there?... Yeah. We all need mirrors to remind ourselves who we are. I'm no different.
I'm not a killer. I'm just someone who wanted to make things right. Can't I just let myself forget what you've told me? Can't I just let myself forget what you've made me do. You think I just want another puzzle to solve? Another John G. to look for? You're John G. So you can be my John G... Will I lie to myself to be happy? In your case Teddy... yes I will.
Memory can change the shape of a room; it can change the color of a car. And memories can be distorted. They're just an interpretation, they're not a record, and they're irrelevant if you have the facts.
Now... where was I?
If we can't make memories, we can't heal.
What's the last thing that you do remember?
My wife...
That's sweet.
...dying.
I don't even know how long she's been gone. It's like I've woken up in bed and she's not here... because she's gone to the bathroom or something. But somehow, I know she's never gonna come back to bed. If I could just... reach over and touch... her side of the bed, I would know that it was cold, but I can't. I know I can't have her back... but I don't want to wake up in the morning, thinking she's still here. I lie here not knowing... how long I've been alone. So how... how can I heal? How am I supposed to heal if I can't... feel time?
I can't remember to forget you.
Remember Sammy Jankis.
I have this condition.
We all need mirrors to remind ourselves who we are. I'm no different.
I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.
I fucking hope not.
Hey! Hey, that's not your car!
It is now.
Jesus Chri- you can't take it!
Why not?
Because the guy you killed owns it; somebody will recognize it!
Well, I rather be mistaken for a dead guy than a killer.
...who did this to you?
What?
Who did this to you?
You did.
There are things you know for sure.
Such as?
I know what that's going to sound like when I knock on it. I know that's what going to feel like when I pick it up. See? Certainties. It's the kind of memory that you take for granted.
These tracks are just a few days old.
What are you, Pocahontas?
But even if you get revenge you're not gonna remember it. You're not even going to know that it happened.
My wife deserves vengance. Doesn't make a difference whether I know about it. Just becuase there are things I don't remember doesn't make my actions meaningless. The world doesn't just disappear when you close your eyes, does it? Anyway, maybe I'll take a photograph to remind myself, get another freaky tattoo.
Tell me about her again.
Why?
Because you like to remember her.
She was beautiful. To me, she was perfect.
No, don't just recite the words. Close your eyes... and remember her.
You can just feel the details. The bits and pieces you never bothered to put into words. And you can feel these extreme moments... even if you don't want to. You put these together, and you get the feel of a person. Enough to know how much you miss them... and how much you hate the person who took them away.
You're living.
Only for revenge.
You know how many towns, how many guys called James G? Or John G? Shit, Leonard, I'm a fuckin' John G.
Your name's Teddy.
My *mother* calls me Teddy.
I don't want your fucking money.
Then what? What do you want?
I want my fucking life back!
Hi. Uh, Lincoln Street?
Oh, you just take the main road...
Hang on, let me write this down.
Oh, it's easy. You just...
Trust me, I need to write this down.
When I looked into his eyes I thought I saw recognition. Now I know. You fake it. If you think you're supposed to recognize somebody you, you just pretend. You bluff it to get a pat on the head from the doctors. You bluff it to seem less like a freak.
How can you read that again?
It's good.
Yeah, but you read it like a thousand times.
I enjoy it.
I always thought the pleasure of a book was wanting to know what comes next.
Hey, don't be a prick. I'm not reading it to annoy you, I enjoy it. Just let me read... please.
Beg my wife's forgiveness, before I blow
your brains out.
I found you, you fuck.
I always thought the joy of reading a book is not knowing what happens next.
Sammy Jankis wrote himself endless notes. But he'd get mixed up. I've got a more graceful solution to the memory problem. I'm disciplined and organized. I use habit and routine to make my life possible. Sammy had no drive. No reason to make it work.
I take it I've told you about my condition.
Only every time I see ya.
If we talk for too long, I'll forget how we started. Next time I see you, I'm not gonna remember this conversation. I don't even know if I've met you before.
I've told you this before, haven't I?
My car.
This is your car.
Oh, you're in a playful mood. It's not good for you to make fun of somebody's handicap.
Just trying to have a little fun.
You don't know who you are anymore.
Of course I do. I'm Leonard Shelby. I'm from San Francisco.
No, that's who you were. Maybe it's time you started investigating yourself.
Was he scared?
Yeah, I think it was your sinister moustache.
Fuck you.
It's just an anonymous room. There's nothing in the drawers. But you look anyway. Nothing except the Gideon bible, which I, of course, read religiously.
Awake. Where am I?
You know, I can remember so much. The feel of the world... her.
She's gone. And the present is trivia, which I scribble down as fucking notes.
What's it like?
It's like waking. Like you just woke up.
That must suck.
Facts, not memories. That's how you investigate. I know, it's what I used to do.
Oh shit. This is the wrong room. You're in 304 now. I'm sorry. I fucked up.
This is not my room?
No, come on, let's go.
Why is this my handwriting?
...This was your room, but now you're in 304.
When was I in here?
Last week. But then I rented you another room on top of it.
Why?
Business is slow. I mean, I told my boss about the - your condition and stuff, and he said try and rent him another room.
So how many rooms am I checked into in this shit-hole?
Just two, so far.
Well, at least you're being honest about ripping me off.
Well, you're not gonna remember anyway.
You don't have to be *that* honest, Burt.
Leonard, always get a receipt.
That's good advice. I'll have to write that down.
So where are you? You're in some motel room. You just - you just wake up and you're in - in a motel room. There's the key. It feels like maybe it's just the first time you've been there, but perhaps you've been there for a week, three months. It's - it's kind of hard to say. I don't - I don't know. It's just an anonymous room.
Natalie, right?
Who the fuck is Dodd?
Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.
Hmmm. I don't feel drunk.
Get rid of Dodd for me. Kill him. I'll pay you.
Are you crazy? I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
What then? Love? What would you kill for? You'd kill for your wife, wouldn't you?
That's different!
Not to me, I wasn't fucking married to her!
Strip!
Take off your pants too.
Why?
I don't want to get blood on them.
You really want to get this guy, don't you?
He killed my wife. He took away my fucking memory. He destroyed my ability to live.
Sammy had no drive, no reason to make it work.
Me? Yeah, I got a reason.
Probably burned truck loads of your stuff before. Can't remember to forget you.
I was the only guy who disagreed with the cops - and I had brain damage.
My wife deserves revenge, whether I know about it or not.
I meet Sammy through work. Insurance. I was an investigator. I'd investigate the claims to see which ones were phony. I had to see through people's bullshit. It was useful experience, 'cause now it's my life.
Ah, fuck... Sorry."
Conan the Barbarian,BF,Revenge,"I suppose nothing hurts you.
Only pain.
Into the boat!
Enough talk!
I think we made the merchant angry.
Are you surprised?
But we didn't steal everything he had!
We didn't have time.
Death to the world.
Life for Valeria.
Conan! There are six of them against her!
One, two, three... I think you're right.
I need you.
I'm yours!
Could there ever be anyone else?
Drunk - Another Queen? Lot on your knife... Uh, not on your life!
Good. Now you're ready to take on anybody!
I go where I feel myself led.
So I've noticed.
Why are they trying to kill us?
Maybe they want to capture us, and torture us to death."
Randal Graves,H,Bromantic Foil,"Oh yeah, I don't know how you top off a night like this... oh wait... sex in a car.
What? What is the big deal? Since when did it become a crime to say porch monkey?
Oh, I don't know, since forever?
Why?
Because porch monkey's a racial slur against black people!
No it's not! Nigger is.
Randal!
What?
Excuse me, but did you just call Mr. Dante a nigger?
Shut up, Elias!
No I did not just call Mr. Dante a nigger, I simply said that nigger is a racial slur towards black people.
So is porch monkey!
Oh, it is not! Coon, spook, spade, moolie, jigaboo, nig-nog, *those* are racial slurs towards black people! Porch Monkey is not!
All right, look, there's only one ""Return,"" okay, and it ain't ""of the King,"" it's ""of the Jedi.""
Oh, Star Wars geek.
Oh, I'm the geek? Look at you two whipping out your preciouses.
You'll have to excuse him, he's not ""down"" with the trilogy.
Oh, what the fuck happened to this world? There's only one trilogy, you fucking morons.
You know what, maybe we should start calling your friend Padme, because he loves Manakin Skywalker so much, right?
Danger danger, my name is Anakin. My shitty acting is ruining saga.
Yea-Yeah, you're crazy, Jar-Jar.
Oh, I'm crazy? Those fuckin' hobbit movies were boring as hell. All it was, was a bunch of people walking, three movies of people walking to a fucking volcano.
I'm not eating something that was cooked by some cracker-ass hatemonger!
I will. Baby, you can't taste racism!
What racism, ""porch monkeys?""
It just centers me, alright? Kinda the way jerking off at work centers you.
I only did it that one time. And it wasn't to center me.
Yeah, it was to cum. Well I dunno about you, but cumming centers me.
Then why did we have to leave work so you can ride the Go-Karts to clear you head?
Well, I don't wanna jerk off in the Mooby's bathroom! What if a customer comes in and my jerking off gets him all sex nuts and retard strong, and suddenly I'm fighting him off as he tries to jam my dick in his mouth!
The most likeliest of scenarios.
Why because I enjoyed what I did? I got to watch movies fuck with assholes and hang out with my best friend all day, can you think of a better way to make a living? Yeah maybe it wasn't what everyone does but it was pretty fucking good.
Have you become so embittered that you now feel the need to attack the handicapped?
What handicap? They guy's just in a wheelchair, it's not like he's Anne Frank or something.
Anne Frank?
Yeah, Anne Frank. The chick that was all duhhh, till the miracle worker showed up and knocked some smarts into her.
You're talking about Helen Keller.
No I'm not, I'm talking about Anne Frank. She was deaf, dumb and blind.
No she wasn't. Helen Keller was deaf, dumb and blind.
Are you sure?
Yup.
Then who the fuck's Anne Frank?
Why haven't you fucked Myra yet?
Well, we can't because of Pillow Pants.
What the fuck's Pillow Pants?
Pillow Pants is a little troll who lives in her pussy.
Pillow Pants is her pussy troll?
Duh. You know how every girl's parents put a pussy troll in them when the girls are young, to keep them from having premarital sex?
...Sure.
Well Myra's is named Pillow Pants. And so even though she totally wants to have sex with me, Myra says if I put my... thing in her, Pillow Pants will bite it off. So, I gotta wait until Pillow Pants gets peed out of her body on her 21st birthday before we can have sex.
And Myra told you this?
Boyfriends and girlfriends talk to each other about sex stuff Randal. You'd know this if you ever had a girlfriend.
Have you and Myra even kissed yet?
We would have already if it wasn't for Listerfiend.
Listerfiend is her mouth troll, isn't it?
Women.
Since God created man, and man created the Transformers, the Transformers are like a gift from God, Randal!
No sir. They are not a gift from God. They are an unholy curse from the beast we call the Desolate One.
I don't really want to hear this Randal.
The First of the Fallen. The Spoiler of Virgins, the Master of Abortions!
You know I don't like to talk about dark forces Randal.
Let me help you out of your chair, Grandma!
Grandma what was it like? To be on that holiday site
Late that night I awoke from my sleep.
Hearing! Unknown! Voices!

Laughing insane!

Laughing insane!
We were just killing time with those classes! One semester we took Criminology, for Christ's sakes. What the fuck were we training to be, Batmen?
That look was so gay. I thought Sam was gonna tell the little hobbits to take a walk so he could saunter over to Frodo and suck his fucking cock. Now *that* would have been an Academy Award worthy ending.
Hey faggot, they're not gay! They're hobbits!
And then, right after the Sam/Frodo suckfest, right before the credits roll, Sam fucking flat out bricks in Frodo's mouth.
Before he was the Mad Ducats guy, he was just Pickle Fucker. You see, freshman year, the seniors would hunt us down and put us through what they called ""initiations."" They'd stuff us into lockers or throw us in the girl's shower room naked, but Lance here got the worst of it. The seniors yanked down his pants and shoved a pickle up his ass and made him walk ten feet. If the pickle fell out before he hit the ten-foot mark, he had to take a bite of it, re-insert it, and walk again.
Ewwwwww...
Yeah. But, don't worry. He made it. His pickle was small enough to stay wedged after only four bites.
I'll bet you're the only guy in the world who still remembers that, Graves.
Oh, I bet you still remember it pretty vividly, Pickle Fucker.
What the fuck?
PORCH MONKEY?
Oh, no no, it's cool, I'm taking it back.
It must be nice to have a job with so much downtime.
Downtime's important. If I had to deal with all the fucking mouthbreathers non-stop without a break, I'd put my head in the deep-fryer.
Balls, too...
Fuck, I had to take a fuckin' order off a guy I blew after Junior Prom, once.
Yeah, I've waited on your brother, too.
You wouldn't wanna be with a girl with an oversized clit?
No, 'cause the next step is a guy with an undersized dick.
Man, you must love this fucking guy, 'cause he's the biggest pussy I ever met, the dude who lives his life according to everyone else's standards. ""I have to go down to Florida and get married because that what's expected of me."" And the fucking insane part is, he ain't even crazy about the chick he's marrying or Florida, never mind the fact that he's got a perfectly good chick right here in Jersey who he's nuts about, and even Anne fucking Frank could see she's nuts about him too. And she likes you for who you are, man. She ain't trying to stuff you into a box you'll never fit into, not to mention that she's carrying your hideous fucking chud of a kid. Jesus, if you had any sense whatsoever, you'd fucking stop trying to bray it up with the rest of the sheep and live your life the way it makes sense to you, you fucking ass.
Terrorists?
I left the coffee pot on again, didn't I?
Shit! Now where am I gonna bring chicks to fuck when my mom's home?
You fuckin' freak.
I'm not even gonna point out the irony, here.
Here's the first movie.
And here's the second movie.
He is way off, loser.
You ready for the third movie?
Jail cell design hasn't changed much in centuries, has it? Maybe it's time they brought in the laser bars, or something.
Oh, they can make a hard plastic cage like Magneto's in X-Men 2! Nauw.
Come on, dude, let's keep it in the real world, alright? But you know what wouldn't be a bad idea? Carbonite. What do you think, Dante?
I think I'm gonna kill you!
What up, steel cage match!
You ruined my life!
Your life was already ruined, get off of me!
What were you thinking? A fuckin' Donkey show?
It was your going away present!
Sure was! I just never thought I'd be going away to prison!
Boys? You can't be imprisoned for watching an inter-species sex act. You'll walk. The worst I'll get is a huge fine for animal abuse, and alot of disgusted looks from ass-wipe conservatives who can't appreciate sexual exploration.
I miss my donkey.
I can't believe you.
I finally get my shit together, I'm hours away from getting out of here, and you somehow manage to obliterate all that and reduce me to a convict!
Oh yeah, it's my fault that your life's so fucked up! I'm the engaged guy who knocked up my boss!
You knocked up the guy that owns Mooby's? Sick!
Would you just shut up?
Chicks dig Lord of the Rings, Randal.
Shyeah, the kind of chicks into swords and elves and shit, and I wouldn't fuck them with the Torch of Gondor.
Oh, you're so gross!
Why *do* the Go-Karts help?
I don't know. They just remind me of a better time in my life.
Like when?
Like when we were young and the world was still in front of us.
We're not that old.
Yeah. But, sometimes I get the feeling the world kinda left us behind a long time ago.
You know, you can do something about that.
I told you, I don't wanna jerk off in the bathroom at work!
I know you've given a blowjob, right?
I haven't even put my purse down, yet.
That's a yes.
And I know you've gone down on chicks.
What's your point?
Well, when you're done chowing down on the no-no parts of your lover you kiss 'em, right? That's just like going ass to mouth.
Okay, I'm pretty sure you just compared a vagina to an asshole.
And?
Have you restocked all the napkin holders yet?
That's an Elias job!
That comparison of pink and brown eyes just made it a Randal job.
Zing!
Shut the fuck up, GoBot!
I could probably sue this whole corporation right now for sexual harassment. You're just making me restock the napkin holders because of my firmly held beliefs on the subject of ass to mouth.
You never go ass to mouth!
Would you grow up?
Since when did porch monkey suddenly become a racial slur?
When ignorant racists started saying it a hundred years ago!
Oh, bullshit! My grandmother used to call me a porch monkey all the time when I was a kid because I'd sit on the porch and stare at my neighbors!
Despite the fact that your grandmother might've used it as a term of endearment for you, it's still a racial slur! It'd be like your grandmother calling you a little kike!
Oh, it is not. Plus, my grandmother had nothing but the utmost respect for the Jewish community. When I was a kid she told me to always treat the Jewish kids with the utmost respect, or they'd put the sheni curse on me.
What the fuck, man?
What?
Sheni's a racial slur, too!
Oh, it is not.
Yes, it is!
She never called any Jews 'sheni', she just used to say sheni curse a lot. It was cute!
It wasn't cute! It was racist!
I disagree, man, she was just an old timer, that's the way people talked back then! Didn't mean they were racist... Although my grandmother did refer to a broken beer bottle once as a nigger knife... You know, come to think of it, my grandmother was kind of a racist.
You think?
Well,I still don't think porch monkey should be considered a racial term. I mean, I've always used it to describe lazy people, not lazy black people! I think if we really tried, we could re-claim it, and save it.
It can't be saved, Randal! The sole purpose for its creation, the only reason it exists in the first place, is to disparage an entire race! And even if it could be saved, you can't save it because you're not black!
Well listen to you! Telling me I can't do something because of the color of my skin! You're the racist! I'm taking it back, you watch!
Hey, what can I get for you, you little porch monkey?
Its cool, I'm taking it back.
Hey man.
Welcome to Mooby's, may I take your order?
Yeah um, let's see... Give me one udderly delicious Moo-ilk shake, Skinny Calf and a, order of onion rings. Thanks.
""One ring to rule them all.""
""One ring to find them.""
Oh Jesus.
""One ring to bring them all.""
""And in the darkness bind them!""
Yes! How many times?
Umm, three for 'Fellowship', two for 'Towers', *four* for 'Return'.
Five for return.
Dude.
Okay, look. There's only one 'Return', okay, and it ain't of 'The King', it's of 'The Jedi'.
Oh, Star Wars geek.
Oh I'm the geek? Look at you two whipping out your preciouses.
You'll have to excuse him. He's not 'down' with the trilogy.
Oh, what the fuck happened to this world? There's only one trilogy you fucking morons.
You know what, maybe we should start calling your friend Padme, because he loves Mannequin Skywalker so much, right?
Danger, danger, my name is Anakin. My shitty acting is ruining saga.
Yeah, you're crazy, Jar-Jar.
Oh I'm crazy? Those fucking hobbit movies were boring as hell. All it was was a bunch of people walking. Three movies of people walking to a fucking volcano... Here's the first movie...
... And here's the second movie...
...
He is way off. Loser.
...You ready for the third movie?
Fuckin' A.
What are you writing over there, your memoirs?
I'm battling this jackass on his blog's message boards.
About what?
About how he's got too much free time and no life. A guy in a wheelchair who's always preying on other people's sympathies, writing these long diatribes about how he'll never walk again, and how walkers should appreciate the blessings of their functioning legs, so I've been getting into it with him, throwing it right back in his stupid crippie-boy face about how I love to just sit around, and how I'd rather drive to the end of the block than walk!
The guy's in a wheelchair.
Yeah. That's why I called him ""crippie-boy.""
Emma, are you like this 'cause you have an unnaturally large clit?
You just *had* to tell him, didn't ya?
It kinda came out one day!
He says it's so big it's almost like a little cock, which says all kinds of weird things about him that I don't even wanna think about.
You became persona non-nookie to me the minute he started diddling your pooter.
So thinking of me in terms of being a girl kind of creeps you out, does it?
Sweetheart, I don't think of you in terms of being a girl, I don't think of you in any way...
Oh, that was just *wrong*.
If you don't get the fuck out of here so that I can spend some quality time with my man, next I'm gonna show you my pooter.
Why would you wanna do something like that?
Alright, alright, I'm leaving!
I don't think these look right.
Jesus! Step away from the fryer before you burn us all alive!
It's not my fault you abandoned your post!
Was it too much to ask that you handle the fries? The machine does all the work! What's a machine gotta transform into some giant fuckin' robot before you'll take it seriously? Go home!
That's bestiality, Randal!
At its finest, I hope.
Who would want to see something like that?
Me, Dante, *you*.
I don't wanna see something like that! Why would you wanna see something like that?
Because it's fucked up! And, I wanna see if a chick with a mouth full of donkey spunk swallows. Alright, here we go. Kinky Kelly and the Sexy Stud. Straight from their dirty debut in Tijuana, Kelly's taking it on the road. Taking it in the ass, that is. You gotta give it up for Oscar Wilde-like wordplay that good.
Do they show pictures?
Only one of Kinky Kelly sucking off Optimus Prime.
Really?
Ow.
Lemme borrow your cell phone.
Oh... 'Cause I'm only supposed to use it to call my parents in case of an emergency.
This is an emergency. We gotta lock up Kinky Kelly for tonight so we can give Mr. Dante a memorable send off. You love Mr. Dante, don'tcha?
In a non-gay way.
How the fuck do you always have like two good-looking girls who want you? You're the most hideous fucking chud I've ever met, and you always have a pair of girls fighting over you.
You swung at me!
You ducked.
Because you swung at me!
I can't believe you. I finally get my shit together. I'm hours from getting outta here, and really starting my life, and you somehow figure out a way to obliterate all that and reduce me to a convict.
Oh, yeah, it's my fault your life's fucked up. ""I'm the engaged guy who knocked up my boss!""
You knocked up the guy who owns Mooby's?
What?
You're my best friend, and I love you... In a totally heterosexual way.
Yeah, right.
Ladies and gentlemen, and you, Elias! Straight from the debauchery capital of the world, Tijuana Mexico!
Oh, God, no.
Oh, God, yes!
Seventeen year olds nowadays are crazy. They're up for anything. They even like it when you go ass to mouth.
Oh, my God.
What?
Are you serious?
I don't fuck around when it comes to ass to mouth.
You never go ass to mouth!
It's never my idea!
What's the point in having an Internet connection if you're not using it to look up weird, fucked-up pictures of dirty sex you'll never have yourself?
No, we had sex one night after work a few weeks ago.
What? Where?
Here, on the prep station table.
Ew, that's my prep table.
If Peter Jackson really wanted to blow me away with those ""Rings"" movies, he would have ended the third one on the logical closure point, not the 25 endings that followed.
Even the fuckin' trees walked in those movies.
I'd buy the Quick Stop and reopen it myself. That's what I'd do. That's what we should do.
Avert your eyes, ya' perv!
Not very hygienic. That's all I'm gonna tell you.
You're gonna be rolling in the pussy, man!
Don't be gross!
Says the guy who was just playing tonsil hockey with his mother.
The best part of this job is all the barely legal pussy that comes in here. And they all look up to me 'cause I've got a driver's license. It's awesome.
You know something? You're not even supposed to be here today!
Randal...
""One ring to rule them all.""
And you wonder why no chick'll let you stick your cock in her.
I never wondered that.
Yeah, 'cause you've accepted the fact that you'll never get a chick a long time ago.
I could get a chick if I wanted.
Who are you kidding? You can't get a chick ya mook, you're too weird and sad.
I turn down chicks left and right.
Your chicks are your ""left"" and ""right.""
Yeah right, what do you know?
Ahh, I know that you're a huge fucking nerd of Potsie-like proportions, and no chicks dig nerds. Especially nerds that are into Lord of the Rings.
Chicks dig Lord of the Rings, Randal.
Yeah. The kind of chicks that are into swords and elves and shit, and I wouldn't fuck them with the torch of Gondor.
Oh, you're so gross!
The best part of this job is all the barely legal pussy that comes in here. And they all look up to me 'cause I've got a driver's license. It's awesome.
You're thirty-three.
You show me one thirty-three year old chick who's buck wild in bed as your seventeen year old counterpie. Seventeen year olds nowadays are crazy. They even like it when you go ass-to-mouth.
Oh... My... God.
What?
Are you serious?
I don't fuck around when it comes to ass-to-mouth.
You never go ass-to-mouth.
It's never my idea. These young girls, they get all horned up and they tell you to go ass-to-mouth.
You never go ass-to-mouth, Randal.
You sound like my Mom.
Becks, do you ever go ass-to-mouth?
You never go ass-to-mouth.
You've never gone ass-to-mouth.
You never go ass-to-mouth.
I've never gone ass to mouth.
Not even once?
Not even ever.
You're both so repressive.
Alright look, I know you've given a blowjob, right?
I haven't even put my purse down yet.
That's a yes.
And I know you've gone down on chicks.
What's your point?
Well, when you're done chowin' down on the no-no parts of your lover, you kiss 'em, right? That's just like going ass to mouth.
Okay, I'm pretty sure you just compared a vagina to an ass hole.
Sometimes, in the heat of the moment, it's forgivable to go ass to mouth.
Heh. I knew it.
So, where're we doin' this thing?
Oh, right inside the restaurant.
You're kidding.
Not spacious enough?
No, it's plenty spacious, just kinda weird, isn't it?
Kinda weird? You're in the bestiality business, dude.
Hey, Fucko, we like to call it inter-species erotica.
Intriguing.
Can you feel it?
Feel what?
Today is the first day of the rest of our lives.
I made fun of ""Lord of the Rings"" so hard, it made some supergeek puke all over the counter. Where do we keep the mop and bucket so I can have Elias clean it up?
In the closet, with the rest of the cleaning products.
We have cleaning products?
Ease up, Pillow Pants. The dude's not into your D&D; GoBots bullshit.
""One Ring to rule them all.""
""One Ring to find them.""
Oh, Jesus.
""One Ring to bring them all.""
""And in the darkness, bind them!""
As you know, my online handle is Optimus Prime.
I know that, I wish I didn't.
I'm having second thoughts.
About your sexuality?
I got to rent movies, fuck with assholes, and hang out with my best friend, Dante.
You can't get a chick, ya mook. You're too weird and sad.
I turn down chicks left and right.
Your chicks *are* your left and right.
Hey! Freddy fucking Mercury! Where the fuck is Kelly?
This is Kelly!
I thought that was the sexy stud.
*I'm* the sexy stud.
But this donkey is a dude!
Kelly can be a guy's name too. Hey!
When it's over, if you want, you can fuck Kelly.
Really? Sweet!
Yeah.
If he's gonna jerk off, I'm gonna jerk off, too
I don't think he's gonna jerk off.
May your first child be a masculine child!
How the fuck did you father a child with a chick that's not your fiancé? Holy shit, she got pregnant off the toilet seat you jerked off onto! I fucking knew it!
Dude, I'm pretty sure your old lady wants to get you and me together in a three-way!
The Transformers were a total slight against God. In as much as God sent his only begotten son to die on the cross to redeem mankind and all we did to pay him back was make terrible fucking cartoons, like the Transformers.
Do we have a mop?
Yeah it's in the closet with the other cleaning supplies.
We have cleaning supplies?
I don't mind people snickering at the stupid uniform I've gotta wear, but I'll be damned if I let some self-righteous lucky turd come in here and treat me and Dante like we're a couple of fucking porch monkeys!
Well, I mean, as you know, my online handle is Optimus Prime.
I know that. I wish I didn't.
I thought you weren't even allowed to watch a lot of TV in your house cause you're all Christian and shit.
Well, as it turns out, cars and trucks that turn into robots aren't really that blasphemous. Because my pastor says that machines can turn into other machines and it's not a slight against God.
Transformers are a TOTAL slight against God. Inasmuch as God sent his only begotten son to die on the cross to redeem mankind, and all we did to pay him back was make terrible fucking cartoons like the Transformers.
While you guys were gone I had to wait on a guy I gave a blow-job to when I was in 9th grade.
Yeah, I've waited on your brother before, too.
You ever see a chick give a mule a blowjob?
And you wonder why no chick will let you stick your cock in her.
I never wondered that.
Dude, the Transformers sucked.
Oh no they didn't, they're more than meets the eye."
Brodie Bruce,"H, BI","Bromantic Foil, Slacker","But they're engaged.
Doesn't matter, it can't happen.
Why not? It's bound to come up.
It's impossible. Lois could never have Superman's baby. Do you think her fallopian tubes could handle his sperm? I guarantee he blows a load like a shotgun right through her back. What about her womb? Do you think it's strong enough to carry his child?
Sure, why not?
He's an alien, for Christ sake. His Kyrptonian biological makeup is enhanced by Earth's yellow sun. If Lois gets a tan, the kid could kick right through her stomach. Only someone like Wonder Woman has a strong enough uterus to carry his kid. The only way he could bang regular chicks is with a Kryptonite condom, but that would kill him.
How is it that I go from the verge of hot Floridian sex with Brandi to Man of Steel coital debates with you in the food court?
Cookie stand isn't part of the food court.
Of course it is.
The food court is downstairs. The cookie stand is upstairs. It not like we're talking quantum physics here.
The cookie stands counts as an eatery, eateries are part of the food court.
Bullshit! Eateries that operate within the designated square downstairs qualify as food court. Anything outside, of said designated square, is considered an autonomous unit for mid-mall snacking. Now, if you're going to wax intellectual about the subject...
One time my cousin Walter got this cat stuck up his ass. True story. He bought it at our local mall, so the whole fiasco wound up on the news. It was embarrasing for my relatives and all, but next week, he did it again. Different cat, same results, complete with another trip to the emergency room. So, I run into him a week later in the mall and he's buying another cat. And I says to him, ""Jesus, Walt! What are you doing? You know you're just gonna get this cat stuck up your ass too. Why don't you knock it off?"" And he said to me, ""Brodie, how the hell else am I supposed to get the gerbil out?"" My cousin was a weird guy.
Second suitor, would you ever make whoopie in public?
I already did once today.
But my cousin Walter jerked off in public once. True story. He was on a plane to New Mexico when all of the sudden the hydraulics went. The plane started spinning around, going out of control, so he decides it's all over and whips it out and starts beating it right there. So all the other passengers take a cue from him and they start whipping it out and beating like mad. So all the passengers are beating off, plummeting to their certain doom, when all of the sudden, snap! The hydraulics kick back in. The plane rights itself and it land safely and everyone puts their pieces or, whatever, you know, away and deboard. No one mentions the phenomenon to anyone else.
Well, did he cum, or what?
Jesus *Christ*, man! There's just some things you don't talk about in public!
You wanna say something?
Yeah. About a million things, but I can't express myself monosyllabically enough for you to understand 'em all.
You're giving up? You? You used to be stand-up guy, what happened to him? The guy who punched Amanda Gross's mother after she called him ""low class"".
That wasn't me. It was you.
Oh, yeah.
And it wasn't her mother, it was her grandmother.
No wonder the bitch went down so fast.
I took you shopping all the time!
You took me where you went shopping, you jerk! You think I care what store in that shitpit dirt mall has the latest Godzilla bootlegs? Do you call eating pizza in the same dive pizzeria every night eating out? Do I give a shit when two major comic book labels are crossing over characters, selling two editions of the same book in varied-ink chromium covers? I'm a girl, damn it! I wanna do girly things! Like fix up someone's hair and get phone calls expressing romantic sentiments!
Is he gone?
Halfway to Buy Me Toys by now.
Man, that bastard's faster than Walt Flanagan's dog...
After all he's done to you, you should still kinda stick it to him.
How do you propose I do that?
You stinkpalm him.
Stinkpalm?
You take your hand and stick it in your ass like this. You been walkin' all day and you're nervous, so no doubt you'll be sweaty as hell.
You should see yourself right now, a grown man with his hand down his pants.
Yeah i probably look like my old man. So you shake hands with the guy, ""Hello Mr. Svenning how have you been?""
Whats the point?
You know how long it takes for that smell to come off? Scrub all you want, it'll stick around for at least two days. How does he explain it to his colleagues and family? They'll think he doesn't know how to wipe his ass properly.
Meanwhile you yourself are left with a hand that smells like shit.
Small price to pay for the smiting of one's enemies.
Suitor number 3, is your kiss like a soft breeze, a firm handshake or a jackhammer?
Definitely a jackhammer, I'm in there with some pressure and when I'm done, you're not the same as before. You're changed.
Where do you come up with this shit? That's the cheesiest response to an honest question I have ever heard. I saw you kiss and it wasn't anything like that.
Suitor #2, you'll have to wait until you're addressed before you respond.
Richard Dawson, why don't you just go back to your podium until it's time to play The Feud. All right?
Who the hell did you see me kiss?
Some dude backstage. I don't know who he was but he seemed unimpressed.
I didn't kiss any guy backstage. I swear. I'm not gay.
Hey, Suitorette, this guys a homophobe. You heard how repulsed he sounded. Is this the kind of guy you want to spend a vacation with? This hate-monger?
I don't hate gay people.
So you love them?
Yes. I mean no.
Textbook closet case self-loather. Can't be comfortable with his own sexuality.
That's it. You're dead, mallrat! I'm gonna fuck you up beyond repair!
Ladies and gentlemen, this tall drink of water headed my way is a pillar of the shopping community who informed me earlier today of a nefarious plan of his to screw my girlfriend in an extremely uncomfortable place.
What... like the back of a Volkswagen?
Second suitor: if we were making whoopee, what sounds would you make?
Wait, what's whoopee?
You know, being intimate.
What? Like fucking?
Yeah, who's your favourite New Kid. Yeah, call me Joey. Oh, come on. Don't make me get loose. Yeah, that's right. Call me Donnie. Oh, girl. Oh, please don't go girl.
Goddamn. This is one wacky game show.
Hey! That girl's only 15!
Ah, 15. I thought she was 36!
Come on, guys. Tell me you wouldn't have popped her.
Shit, bitch, we're gonna bust up that stage like a high school kegger. We're just gonna outwit Lafours, X-Men style.
Should I call you Logan, Weapon-X?
No, *Wolverine*! Shnickty shnickty shnoine!
See, what he's doing is imitating Wolverine's berserker attack with his adamantium claws.
I never would have guessed.
My Grandmother always used to say ""why buy the cow, when you can get the sex for free"".
She didn't!
All the time, before she became a lesbian on her 60th Birthday, but that's besides the point.
Say, would you like a chocolate covered pretzel? They're a little melty but damn are they exquisite.
How is it that you recall the most trivial events?
I'll never forget it. How many times do you get to see Smokey fuck the Bandit?
Didn't I look just like Burt Reynolds?
, :
Except for the moustache.
, :
Except for the moustache.
Hell hath no fury like a woman's scorn for Sega.
Hey, look at that ring. What is that?
That is, um, my Junior College class ring. Cum Laude, '69.
I also hope to cum loud one day, preferably in a 69.
You're fucking kidding me! The Easter bunny did this?
All I said was that the Easter bunny at the Menlo Park mall was more convincing and he just jumped the railing and knocked me down.
He's fucking dead!
Oh let it go, he's under a lot of pressure.
What the hell happened?
The guy in the Easter bunny suit kicked his ass.
I had it coming.
Fuck all that shit! Come on, Silent Bob.
What really happened?
The proprietor of Fashionable Male beat a raincheck into my stomach.
Shannon Hamilton?
You know that guy?
I went out with him once after we dated. He tried to screw me some place very uncomfortable.
What? Like the back of a Volkswagen?
Sounds like his M.O.
You know about this game show they got goin' on here? We need you guys to somehow ensure that it doesn't happen.
Is that it? We were gonna do that anyway.
Really? Why?
What else are we gonna do?
How much longer are we gonna be in this chick store? I'm starting to get a mean hard-on.
That kid is *back*... on the escalator again!
That was too little too late.
Too little? You said it was a good size!
The effort, you retard. The effort was too little too late.
But, now that you mention it, when a girl says its a good size, that's a nice way of saying that it's small.
Hey!
Jesus Christ! What the hell gives with the cover boy?
None of your business, but he'll kick your ass if he knows what you just pulled.
Are you insane? The guy looks like a date rapist! Is that my jacket?
Start the elevator.
Not until you tell me what the situation is with you and the Sperminator out there! How long has this been going on?
Since I mustered the good sense to send you packing. He's a much more suitable companion than you any day.
Are you nuts? The guy's pure testosterone! He's a walking hard-on just looking for a hole!
Why do palm reading topless?
It makes the news easier to take. She could tell me I was going to die in ten minutes, just as long as she told me topless.
Your maleness amazes me sometimes.
I threw her away like a parking ticket.
Suitor number one. If we fell in love, how would you propose to me?
When Jaws popped out of the water...
If we were making whoopee, what kind of noises would you make?
Rrrruff... rr... rruff...
You know, that's kind of a personal question, I don't think I should answer that.
Suitor #2...
Hey, what about me?
Aw Gil, just shut the fuck up!
What are you doing? You promised me breakfast.
Breakfast, shmreakfast. Look at the score, for Christ's sake. It's only the second period and I'm up 12 to 2. Breakfasts come and go, Rene, but Hartford, ""the Whale,"" they only beat Vancouver once, maybe twice in a lifetime.
Listen, not a year goes by, not a year, that I don't hear about some escalator accident involving some bastard kid which could have easily been avoided had some parent - I don't care which one - but some parent conditioned him to fear and respect that escalator.
You have my Punisher War Journal #6, my copy of ""Fletch"" and the remote control to my TV. Now, I know it's going to be hard to give this stuff up because of it's sentimental attachment...
Sentimental attachment? Look, if I have any of that crap it's because you brought it over my house and left it there.
Okay, then let's talk about coming up with a schedule for visitation rights.
For what?
For the mall. I figure you can take the odd days, I'll take the even days and weekends. When there's any special feature like a sidewalk sale...
Brodie, Brodie...
...or a boat show...
Brodie! I've always taken you with a grain of salt. On your birthday, when you told me to do a striptease to the theme of ""Mighty Mouse"", I said okay. On prom night at the hotel when you told me to sleep under the bed in case your mother burst in, I did it. And even during my grandmother's funeral when you told my relatives that you could see her nipples through her burial dress, I let that slide.
But if you think I'm gonna suffer any of your shit with a smile now that we're broken up, you're in for some serious fucking disappointment!
Maybe he's calmed down, we'll talk about it reasonably.
Reasonably shmeasonably, you should go over there and give him shit.
Brandi is the past my friend. You face forward, or you face the possibility of shock and damage.
You should learn to heed your own advice.
Where the hell did that come from? What's going on here?
Looks like a stage is being erected.
What is this monstrosity?
Maybe it's for the Easter Bunny pictures.
Impossible, the Easter Bunny Court is down at the other end of the mall, it's been there since two days after Christmas. I want answers!
I would've made a sexy chick!
You fuckers think just because a guy reads comics he can't start some shit?
You've probably had a slew of women since her, am I right?
Oh, lots of women. Jagger and me, we had a running contest to see who had the most. In fact, last time I checked I was way ahead.
DAMN that's hot!
I love the smell of commerce in the morning.
Suitor Number Three, what would our first date be like?
Well, uh, first I'd take you shopping to stores you wanna shop in, and then we'd do a little lunch, probably at the Cheese Haus, followed by some golfing. And then at night, we'd take in an opera, probably Die Fledermaus, and then I'd follow it up with a drive to a secluded beach where I'd pop on the radio and we could slow-dance till the sun came up.
That was the biggest load of crap I've ever heard! I mean, look at you. You're the kind of guy who would beg for sex. And I should know, we can smell our own.
How easily do you quit? Say you wind up with one of us?
Hopefully not Rush Limbaugh over here.
Well, now, I'm not like Rush Limbaugh.
Well, why not? Because he's fat? Now you have something against fat people, too?
T.S. Quint, meet Tricia Jones. They call her ""Trish the Dish.""
Nobody calls me that.
You two are retarded for each other.
Why don't they ever bring back or remake good shows, like 'BJ and the Bear.' Now there's a concept I can't get enough of, a man and his monkey.
You should see yourself right now - a grown man with his hand down his pants.
Yeah, I probably look like my old man.
Hey, what's going on in there?
I was warned about you. Take it easy before I have you removed from the mall.
Warned? What the fuck are you talking about?
Tell him, Steve-Dave!
Fuck you, Fanboy!
When you two testosterone-seething, he-man, comic book fans finish up with this display of tough guy back-and-forth? I have some questions that need answering.
I was going to propose to her.
Where?
The Universal Tour.
You're kidding. What part?
When Jaws popped out of the water.
That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard.
Too bad I'm not trying to marry you.
I heard that you were going to propose to Brandi Svenning at some theme park. When are men going to learn that women want ROMANCE, not Mr. Toad's Wild Ride...
Be fair. EVERYONE wants Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.
You're going to listen to *me*? To something that *I* said? Hell, most of the time I'm just talking out of my ass... or sticking my hand in it.
Yeah, and she also said I had no dick. Which precedes the financial question, proving once more what women really look for.
What's he doing?
Shithead here watched Empire and Jedi last week and ever since then, he's been trying to do the Jedi mind trick. The crazy fuck thinks he can levitate shit with his thoughts.
Knock it off!
The force is strong with this one.
Dude, don't encourage him.
Free your minds.
I'd like to free something...
They look happy, don't they?
What, the bras?
Woah, she calls you ""callow"" in here.
You say that like it's bad.
It means frightened and weak-willed.
Really? Shit. That was the only part of the letter I thought was complimentary.
Once I realized the both of you were in the mall together, I decided to set up this little ambush to remove you and your sidekick here from the premises, permanently.
Hey, why am I his side-kick? How do you know he's not *my* side-kick?
Look, if I had any kind of glow it's because I just got laid. I would look the same had I banged anyone in that elevator... present company excluded.
Deny it all you want. I think that you're too proud to admit that you want her back.
I suddenly want something very bad to happen to you.
See, that's what you get for fucking with me.
I call you all time!
""Rene, my mom's asleep. Come over."" You call that romantic? When was the last time you pulled out my chair, or told me I was beautiful?
And this guy does all this in a day?
This guy already introduced me to his mother.
Really?
When I walked away, did you make any effort to repair that breach? No, you ran off and cried on the shoulder of Bumble the Boy Wonder over there.
Boy Wonder? Hey, I'm all man, lady!
Want a sip of my soda?
You used to like tits too.
Hey, I love tits as much as the next guy, but why should I pay some old hag good money for some supernatural chicanery coupled with a pair of sagging wrinkled weathered boobs?
Tell me about the elevator.
It goes up-and-down. Ba-dump-tsss.
You're a fickle broad...
It's the third nipple that does it.
Oh, you have a third nipple? I didn't notice.
What are you *talking about*? It's as clear as day! Look at it for god's sake!
You can stare at it. I don't mind.
That is one of your more admirably deplorable traits. You, unlike me, would beat up somebody's grandmother or an entire senior citizens' community if you believed in the principle.
Yeah, but only if they were really old.
Why are you glowing?
I'm *not* glowing!
The Thing! Is his dork made out of orange rock like the rest of his body?
I don't know. It's a superhero secret.
They look happy don't they?
I suppose, as far as couples go.
You know, it reminds me of an issue of Spider-man I did. When Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy went lingerie shopping. Of course, the Green Goblin showed up, and he pumpkin-bombed the hell out of the place. But aside from that, it's pretty much the same thing.
Oh, my god... *holy shit*! Aren't you...
Oh, Stan Lee, hi.
Hey, you know where you're going, they screw people in a very uncomfortable place.
Really?
Yeah.
Hey, hey! You can't strike a prisoner in police custody.
Oh, come on. Just once?
All right, but make it fast.
Did you see that shit? You call that romance?
I call that illegal.
Second Suitor? If you were a comic book character, what character would you be?
Wow! That's a great question. Tough one, though I mean, what does one gauge his response on? Physical prowess? Keen detection skills? The ability to banter well with super villians?
How's your comic book collection, Brodie?
Oh it's goin' good. But, I mean...
Oh, comics? what are you talkin' about lady? I don't collect comics! Comics are for kids!
You're gonna listen to me? To something I said? Hasn't it become abundantly clear during the tenure of our friendship that I don't know shit?
Tell me, did you ever fart in front of her?
No, why do you ask?
I never farted in front of Renee. Not once. Last week, I let one slip and today she dumps me.
You think that's why Renee dumped you? Come on, she's not the shallow type. You're not insinuating...
She was going down on me at the time.

What can I say, I was feeling very relaxed, when I'm relaxed I squirt.
If all she did was dump you, you got off light.
The usual vault rules apply: Touch not, lest ye be touched.
You're such an anal retentive bastard.
Hey, I tried to teach you how to handle comics in the sixth grade, but oh no. You wanted to play little league instead.
Silent Bob stole the schematics from some foolish carpenter and found a weakness just like the fucking Death Star. You knock this crossbeam out and, fuckin' bickety-bam, the whole stage comes crashing down.
Well we were thinking of something simple, but hey, if you want to destroy the stage, we're all for that.
There is something out there that can help us ease our simultanious double loss.
What? Ritual suicide?
No, you idiot, the fucking mall!
I'd prefer ritual suicide.
Oh come on man it'll be great. They have these new cookies at the cookie stand, you have to try 'em. They're awesome.
Smart-ass ex-boyfriend! I've got two things to tell you. One: I don't like you. I see you every week in this mall. I don't like you shiftless layabouts. You're one of those loser fucking mallrat kids. You don't come to the mall to shop or work. You hang out all day, act like you fucking live here. Well, I have no respect for people with no shopping agenda.
Is this what's known as motivated salesmanship?
Rene told me to leave you alone, but she's fucking clueless. The newly single always feel a bit protective of the ex-boyfriend.
If this is her idea of protective, I'd hate to have her mad at me.
You see, Bruce, I like to pick up girls on the rebound from a disappointing relationship. They're much more in need of solace and they're fairly open to suggestion. And, I use that to fuck them some place very uncomfortable.
What, like the back of a Volkswagen?
No. More like someplace girls dread.
I got to hit the bathroom.
PLEASE. Don't say ""hit"".
Come on, this is the dirt mall. Cops don't come here.
Neither does any self-respecting consumer.
Do you really wanna know?
I asked, didn't I? I'm playing the role; the concerned guy.
Fucussa.
That's what I was thinking.
She said 'focus'.
Whatever.
You know how when someone lays with their back to you, and you lay behind them really close and you throw one arm over them?
It's called spooning.
Yeah, but you gotta put the other arm somewhere. You can either lay on it or shove it between your bodies. The only other option is to stretch it above your head. But sometimes my arm pops out of socket when I'm sleeping like that. So I was constantly searching for someplace to keep my arm while still laying close to her.
And?
What do you mean, 'and'? That's like a metaphor for our whole relationship. I'm all out. I'll meet you at the food court.
I know exactly how he feels. Excuse me.
Hey Hamilton! Let's try and wrap this up, alright? I promised her breakfast!
These should have boards in them. Bloody savage.
Little Trisha here is only fifteen, but somehow she's a senior.
How did you manage that?

Don't listen to him. I studied my ass off.
Yeah, right. So what do you say? You wanna nail T.S. Or what?
Jesus, Brodie!
Hey guys, you'll never guess who I just met.
What happened to these two?
Power of the dark side.
Wait a minute. There's only two. There's supposed to be three! What happened to the third guy?
I never saw a third guy.
What happened to these two?
Um... they got light headed.
You got that right.
So, what's going to happen now? They going to cancel the show?
What do you care, asshole?
I'm supposed to be on it. I'm Gil Hicks, Suitor Number Three.
We're gonna take their places. Hi. I'm T.S. Quint, this is my friend Brodie Bruce.
Hey, didn't Svenning have you arrested?
Look man, don't give him any shit!
Something's going on here. Where's Mr. Svenning?
Mr. Svenning has come down with a sudden case of depheria.
What happened to these two?
The homeboys got a case of the mad munchies!
Hey, Roddy Roddy, isn't this the guy that Svenning had arrested?
Why yes it is. All right Quint, I don't know how you got back in here, but we're postponing the start of the show until I call Mr. Svenning. You've brought down the fire, well now you've got it! Security!
Hey, Roddy!
Somebody call security? What happened here?
Oh, these two guys got stonned and knocked this guy out. I think he needs medical attention.
That's not what happ...
Yeah, could you get him and these two guys out of here? The show's about to start.
Whatever.
Look asshole, just go out there with us and behave, and you'll be just fine.
Jay, when Tricia shows up here with a video tape, you give it to Silent Bob.
Check. Say, where is that tubby bitch?
But they're engaged.
Doesn't matter, it can't happen.
Why not? It's bound to come up.
It's impossible. Lois could never have Superman's baby. Do you think her fallopian tubes could handle his sperm? I guarantee he blows a load like a shotgun right through her back. What about her womb? Do you think it's strong enough to carry his child?
Sure, why not?
He's an alien, for Christ sake. His Kyrptonian biological makeup is enhanced by Earth's yellow sun. If Lois gets a tan, the kid could kick right through her stomach. Only someone like Wonder Woman has a strong enough uterus to carry his kid. The only way he could bang regular chicks is with a Kryptonite condom, but that would kill him.
How is it that I go from the verge of hot Floridian sex with Brandi to Man of Steel coital debates with you in the food court?
Cookie stand isn't part of the food court.
Of course it is.
The food court is downstairs. The cookie stand is upstairs. It not like we're talking quantum physics here.
The cookie stands counts as an eatery, eateries are part of the food court.
Bullshit! Eateries that operate within the designated square downstairs qualify as food court. Anything outside, of said designated square, is considered an autonomous unit for mid-mall snacking. Now, if you're going to wax intellectual about the subject...
One time my cousin Walter got this cat stuck up his ass. True story. He bought it at our local mall, so the whole fiasco wound up on the news. It was embarrasing for my relatives and all, but next week, he did it again. Different cat, same results, complete with another trip to the emergency room. So, I run into him a week later in the mall and he's buying another cat. And I says to him, ""Jesus, Walt! What are you doing? You know you're just gonna get this cat stuck up your ass too. Why don't you knock it off?"" And he said to me, ""Brodie, how the hell else am I supposed to get the gerbil out?"" My cousin was a weird guy.
Second suitor, would you ever make whoopie in public?
I already did once today.
But my cousin Walter jerked off in public once. True story. He was on a plane to New Mexico when all of the sudden the hydraulics went. The plane started spinning around, going out of control, so he decides it's all over and whips it out and starts beating it right there. So all the other passengers take a cue from him and they start whipping it out and beating like mad. So all the passengers are beating off, plummeting to their certain doom, when all of the sudden, snap! The hydraulics kick back in. The plane rights itself and it land safely and everyone puts their pieces or, whatever, you know, away and deboard. No one mentions the phenomenon to anyone else.
Well, did he cum, or what?
Jesus *Christ*, man! There's just some things you don't talk about in public!
You wanna say something?
Yeah. About a million things, but I can't express myself monosyllabically enough for you to understand 'em all.
You're giving up? You? You used to be stand-up guy, what happened to him? The guy who punched Amanda Gross's mother after she called him ""low class"".
That wasn't me. It was you.
Oh, yeah.
And it wasn't her mother, it was her grandmother.
No wonder the bitch went down so fast.
I took you shopping all the time!
You took me where you went shopping, you jerk! You think I care what store in that shitpit dirt mall has the latest Godzilla bootlegs? Do you call eating pizza in the same dive pizzeria every night eating out? Do I give a shit when two major comic book labels are crossing over characters, selling two editions of the same book in varied-ink chromium covers? I'm a girl, damn it! I wanna do girly things! Like fix up someone's hair and get phone calls expressing romantic sentiments!
Is he gone?
Halfway to Buy Me Toys by now.
Man, that bastard's faster than Walt Flanagan's dog...
After all he's done to you, you should still kinda stick it to him.
How do you propose I do that?
You stinkpalm him.
Stinkpalm?
You take your hand and stick it in your ass like this. You been walkin' all day and you're nervous, so no doubt you'll be sweaty as hell.
You should see yourself right now, a grown man with his hand down his pants.
Yeah i probably look like my old man. So you shake hands with the guy, ""Hello Mr. Svenning how have you been?""
Whats the point?
You know how long it takes for that smell to come off? Scrub all you want, it'll stick around for at least two days. How does he explain it to his colleagues and family? They'll think he doesn't know how to wipe his ass properly.
Meanwhile you yourself are left with a hand that smells like shit.
Small price to pay for the smiting of one's enemies.
Suitor number 3, is your kiss like a soft breeze, a firm handshake or a jackhammer?
Definitely a jackhammer, I'm in there with some pressure and when I'm done, you're not the same as before. You're changed.
Where do you come up with this shit? That's the cheesiest response to an honest question I have ever heard. I saw you kiss and it wasn't anything like that.
Suitor #2, you'll have to wait until you're addressed before you respond.
Richard Dawson, why don't you just go back to your podium until it's time to play The Feud. All right?
Who the hell did you see me kiss?
Some dude backstage. I don't know who he was but he seemed unimpressed.
I didn't kiss any guy backstage. I swear. I'm not gay.
Hey, Suitorette, this guys a homophobe. You heard how repulsed he sounded. Is this the kind of guy you want to spend a vacation with? This hate-monger?
I don't hate gay people.
So you love them?
Yes. I mean no.
Textbook closet case self-loather. Can't be comfortable with his own sexuality.
That's it. You're dead, mallrat! I'm gonna fuck you up beyond repair!
Ladies and gentlemen, this tall drink of water headed my way is a pillar of the shopping community who informed me earlier today of a nefarious plan of his to screw my girlfriend in an extremely uncomfortable place.
What... like the back of a Volkswagen?
Second suitor: if we were making whoopee, what sounds would you make?
Wait, what's whoopee?
You know, being intimate.
What? Like fucking?
Yeah, who's your favourite New Kid. Yeah, call me Joey. Oh, come on. Don't make me get loose. Yeah, that's right. Call me Donnie. Oh, girl. Oh, please don't go girl.
Goddamn. This is one wacky game show.
Hey! That girl's only 15!
Ah, 15. I thought she was 36!
Come on, guys. Tell me you wouldn't have popped her.
Shit, bitch, we're gonna bust up that stage like a high school kegger. We're just gonna outwit Lafours, X-Men style.
Should I call you Logan, Weapon-X?
No, *Wolverine*! Shnickty shnickty shnoine!
See, what he's doing is imitating Wolverine's berserker attack with his adamantium claws.
I never would have guessed.
My Grandmother always used to say ""why buy the cow, when you can get the sex for free"".
She didn't!
All the time, before she became a lesbian on her 60th Birthday, but that's besides the point.
Say, would you like a chocolate covered pretzel? They're a little melty but damn are they exquisite.
How is it that you recall the most trivial events?
I'll never forget it. How many times do you get to see Smokey fuck the Bandit?
Didn't I look just like Burt Reynolds?
, :
Except for the moustache.
, :
Except for the moustache.
Hell hath no fury like a woman's scorn for Sega.
Hey, look at that ring. What is that?
That is, um, my Junior College class ring. Cum Laude, '69.
I also hope to cum loud one day, preferably in a 69.
You're fucking kidding me! The Easter bunny did this?
All I said was that the Easter bunny at the Menlo Park mall was more convincing and he just jumped the railing and knocked me down.
He's fucking dead!
Oh let it go, he's under a lot of pressure.
What the hell happened?
The guy in the Easter bunny suit kicked his ass.
I had it coming.
Fuck all that shit! Come on, Silent Bob.
What really happened?
The proprietor of Fashionable Male beat a raincheck into my stomach.
Shannon Hamilton?
You know that guy?
I went out with him once after we dated. He tried to screw me some place very uncomfortable.
What? Like the back of a Volkswagen?
Sounds like his M.O.
You know about this game show they got goin' on here? We need you guys to somehow ensure that it doesn't happen.
Is that it? We were gonna do that anyway.
Really? Why?
What else are we gonna do?
How much longer are we gonna be in this chick store? I'm starting to get a mean hard-on.
That kid is *back*... on the escalator again!
That was too little too late.
Too little? You said it was a good size!
The effort, you retard. The effort was too little too late.
But, now that you mention it, when a girl says its a good size, that's a nice way of saying that it's small.
Hey!
Jesus Christ! What the hell gives with the cover boy?
None of your business, but he'll kick your ass if he knows what you just pulled.
Are you insane? The guy looks like a date rapist! Is that my jacket?
Start the elevator.
Not until you tell me what the situation is with you and the Sperminator out there! How long has this been going on?
Since I mustered the good sense to send you packing. He's a much more suitable companion than you any day.
Are you nuts? The guy's pure testosterone! He's a walking hard-on just looking for a hole!
Why do palm reading topless?
It makes the news easier to take. She could tell me I was going to die in ten minutes, just as long as she told me topless.
Your maleness amazes me sometimes.
I threw her away like a parking ticket.
Suitor number one. If we fell in love, how would you propose to me?
When Jaws popped out of the water...
If we were making whoopee, what kind of noises would you make?
Rrrruff... rr... rruff...
You know, that's kind of a personal question, I don't think I should answer that.
Suitor #2...
Hey, what about me?
Aw Gil, just shut the fuck up!
What are you doing? You promised me breakfast.
Breakfast, shmreakfast. Look at the score, for Christ's sake. It's only the second period and I'm up 12 to 2. Breakfasts come and go, Rene, but Hartford, ""the Whale,"" they only beat Vancouver once, maybe twice in a lifetime.
Listen, not a year goes by, not a year, that I don't hear about some escalator accident involving some bastard kid which could have easily been avoided had some parent - I don't care which one - but some parent conditioned him to fear and respect that escalator.
You have my Punisher War Journal #6, my copy of ""Fletch"" and the remote control to my TV. Now, I know it's going to be hard to give this stuff up because of it's sentimental attachment...
Sentimental attachment? Look, if I have any of that crap it's because you brought it over my house and left it there.
Okay, then let's talk about coming up with a schedule for visitation rights.
For what?
For the mall. I figure you can take the odd days, I'll take the even days and weekends. When there's any special feature like a sidewalk sale...
Brodie, Brodie...
...or a boat show...
Brodie! I've always taken you with a grain of salt. On your birthday, when you told me to do a striptease to the theme of ""Mighty Mouse"", I said okay. On prom night at the hotel when you told me to sleep under the bed in case your mother burst in, I did it. And even during my grandmother's funeral when you told my relatives that you could see her nipples through her burial dress, I let that slide.
But if you think I'm gonna suffer any of your shit with a smile now that we're broken up, you're in for some serious fucking disappointment!
Maybe he's calmed down, we'll talk about it reasonably.
Reasonably shmeasonably, you should go over there and give him shit.
Brandi is the past my friend. You face forward, or you face the possibility of shock and damage.
You should learn to heed your own advice.
Where the hell did that come from? What's going on here?
Looks like a stage is being erected.
What is this monstrosity?
Maybe it's for the Easter Bunny pictures.
Impossible, the Easter Bunny Court is down at the other end of the mall, it's been there since two days after Christmas. I want answers!

Suitor Number Three, what would our first date be like?
Well, uh, first I'd take you shopping to stores you wanna shop in, and then we'd do a little lunch, probably at the Cheese Haus, followed by some golfing. And then at night, we'd take in an opera, probably Die Fledermaus, and then I'd follow it up with a drive to a secluded beach where I'd pop on the radio and we could slow-dance till the sun came up.
That was the biggest load of crap I've ever heard! I mean, look at you. You're the kind of guy who would beg for sex. And I should know, we can smell our own.
How easily do you quit? Say you wind up with one of us?
Hopefully not Rush Limbaugh over here.
Well, now, I'm not like Rush Limbaugh.
Well, why not? Because he's fat? Now you have something against fat people, too?
T.S. Quint, meet Tricia Jones. They call her ""Trish the Dish.""
Nobody calls me that.
You two are retarded for each other.
Why don't they ever bring back or remake good shows, like 'BJ and the Bear.' Now there's a concept I can't get enough of, a man and his monkey.
You should see yourself right now - a grown man with his hand down his pants.
Yeah, I probably look like my old man.
Hey, what's going on in there?
I was warned about you. Take it easy before I have you removed from the mall.
Warned? What the fuck are you talking about?
Tell him, Steve-Dave!
Fuck you, Fanboy!
When you two testosterone-seething, he-man, comic book fans finish up with this display of tough guy back-and-forth? I have some questions that need answering.
I was going to propose to her.

The Universal Tour.

Yeah, but only if they were really old.
Why are you glowing?
I'm *not* glowing!
The Thing! Is his dork made out of orange rock like the rest of his body?
I don't know. It's a superhero secret.
They look happy don't they?
I suppose, as far as couples go.
You know, it reminds me of an issue of Spider-man I did. When Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy went lingerie shopping. Of course, the Green Goblin showed up, and he pumpkin-bombed the hell out of the place. But aside from that, it's pretty much the same thing.
Oh, my god... *holy shit*! Aren't you...
Oh, Stan Lee, hi.
Hey, you know where you're going, they screw people in a very uncomfortable place.
Really?
Yeah.
Hey, hey! You can't strike a prisoner in police custody.
Oh, come on. Just once?
All right, but make it fast.
Did you see that shit? You call that romance?
I call that illegal.
Second Suitor? If you were a comic book character, what character would you be?
Wow! That's a great question. Tough one, though I mean, what does one gauge his response on? Physical prowess? Keen detection skills? The ability to banter well with super villians?
How's your comic book collection, Brodie?
Oh it's goin' good. But, I mean...
Oh, comics? what are you talkin' about lady? I don't collect comics! Comics are for kids!
You're gonna listen to me? To something I said? Hasn't it become abundantly clear during the tenure of our friendship that I don't know shit?
Tell me, did you ever fart in front of her?
No, why do you ask?
I never farted in front of Renee. Not once. Last week, I let one slip and today she dumps me.
You think that's why Renee dumped you? Come on, she's not the shallow type. You're not insinuating...
She was going down on me at the time.

What can I say, I was feeling very relaxed, when I'm relaxed I squirt.
If all she did was dump you, you got off light.
The usual vault rules apply: Touch not, lest ye be touched.
You're such an anal retentive bastard.
Hey, I tried to teach you how to handle comics in the sixth grade, but oh no. You wanted to play little league instead.
Silent Bob stole the schematics from some foolish carpenter and found a weakness just like the fucking Death Star. You knock this crossbeam out and, fuckin' bickety-bam, the whole stage comes crashing down.
Well we were thinking of something simple, but hey, if you want to destroy the stage, we're all for that.
There is something out there that can help us ease our simultanious double loss.
What? Ritual suicide?
No, you idiot, the fucking mall!
I'd prefer ritual suicide.
Oh come on man it'll be great. They have these new cookies at the cookie stand, you have to try 'em. They're awesome.
Smart-ass ex-boyfriend! I've got two things to tell you. One: I don't like you. I see you every week in this mall. I don't like you shiftless layabouts. You're one of those loser fucking mallrat kids. You don't come to the mall to shop or work. You hang out all day, act like you fucking live here. Well, I have no respect for people with no shopping agenda.
Is this what's known as motivated salesmanship?
Rene told me to leave you alone, but she's fucking clueless. The newly single always feel a bit protective of the ex-boyfriend.
If this is her idea of protective, I'd hate to have her mad at me.
You see, Bruce, I like to pick up girls on the rebound from a disappointing relationship. They're much more in need of solace and they're fairly open to suggestion. And, I use that to fuck them some place very uncomfortable.
What, like the back of a Volkswagen?
No. More like someplace girls dread.
I got to hit the bathroom.
PLEASE. Don't say ""hit"".
Come on, this is the dirt mall. Cops don't come here.
Neither does any self-respecting consumer.
Do you really wanna know?
I asked, didn't I? I'm playing the role; the concerned guy.
Fucussa.
That's what I was thinking.
She said 'focus'.
Whatever.
You know how when someone lays with their back to you, and you lay behind them really close and you throw one arm over them?
It's called spooning.
Yeah, but you gotta put the other arm somewhere. You can either lay on it or shove it between your bodies. The only other option is to stretch it above your head. But sometimes my arm pops out of socket when I'm sleeping like that. So I was constantly searching for someplace to keep my arm while still laying close to her.
And?
What do you mean, 'and'? That's like a metaphor for our whole relationship. I'm all out. I'll meet you at the food court.
I know exactly how he feels. Excuse me.
Hey Hamilton! Let's try and wrap this up, alright? I promised her breakfast!
These should have boards in them. Bloody savage.
Little Trisha here is only fifteen, but somehow she's a senior.
How did you manage that?

Don't listen to him. I studied my ass off.
Yeah, right. So what do you say? You wanna nail T.S. Or what?
Jesus, Brodie!
Hey guys, you'll never guess who I just met.
What happened to these two?
Power of the dark side.
Wait a minute. There's only two. There's supposed to be three! What happened to the third guy?
I never saw a third guy.
What happened to these two?
Um... they got light headed.
You got that right.
So, what's going to happen now? They going to cancel the show?
What do you care, asshole?
I'm supposed to be on it. I'm Gil Hicks, Suitor Number Three.
We're gonna take their places. Hi. I'm T.S. Quint, this is my friend Brodie Bruce.
Hey, didn't Svenning have you arrested?
Look man, don't give him any shit!
Something's going on here. Where's Mr. Svenning?
Mr. Svenning has come down with a sudden case of depheria.
What happened to these two?
The homeboys got a case of the mad munchies!
Hey, Roddy Roddy, isn't this the guy that Svenning had arrested?
Why yes it is. All right Quint, I don't know how you got back in here, but we're postponing the start of the show until I call Mr. Svenning. You've brought down the fire, well now you've got it! Security!
Hey, Roddy!
Somebody call security? What happened here?
Oh, these two guys got stonned and knocked this guy out. I think he needs medical attention.
That's not what happ...
Yeah, could you get him and these two guys out of here? The show's about to start.
Whatever.
Look asshole, just go out there with us and behave, and you'll be just fine.
Jay, when Tricia shows up here with a video tape, you give it to Silent Bob.
Check. Say, where is that tubby bitch?"
Banky Edwards,H,Bromantic Foil,"Always some white boy gotta invoke the holy trilogy. Bust this: Those movies are about how the white man keeps the brother man down, even in a galaxy far, far away. Check this shit: You got cracker farm boy Luke Skywalker, Nazi poster boy, blond hair, blue eyes. And then you got Darth Vader, the blackest brother in the galaxy, Nubian god!
What's a Nubian?
Shut the fuck up! Now... Vader, he's a spiritual brother, y'know, down with the force and all that good shit. Then this cracker, Skywalker, gets his hands on a light saber and the boy decides he's gonna run the fuckin' universe; gets a whole clan of whites together. And they go and bust up Vader's hood, the Death Star. Now what the fuck do you call that?
Intergalactic civil war?
Gentrification! They gon' drive out the black element to make the galaxy quote, unquote, safe for white folks. And Jedi's the most insulting installment! Because Vader's beautiful black visage is sullied when he pulls off his mask to reveal a feeble, crusty, old white man! They tryin' to tell us that deep inside we all wants to be white!
Well, isn't that true?
Archie is *not* fucking Mr. Weatherbee!
Since you like chicks, right, do you just look at yourself naked in the mirror all the time?
Alright, now see this? This is a four-way road, okay? And dead in the center is a crisp, new, hundred dollar bill. Now, at the end of each of these streets are four people, okay? You following?
Yeah.
Good. Over here, we have a male-affectionate, easy to get along with, non-political agenda lesbian. Down here, we have a man-hating, angry as fuck, agenda of rage, bitter dyke. Over here, we got Santa Claus, and up here the Easter Bunny. Which one is going to get to the hundred dollar bill first?
What is this supposed to prove?
No, I'm serious. This is a serious exercise. It's like an SAT question. Which one is going to get to the hundred dollar bill first? The male-friendly lesbian, the man-hating dyke, Santa Claus, or the Easter bunny?
The man-hating dyke.
Good. Why?
I don't know.
Because the other three are figments of your fucking imagination!
I just have to get something.
Look, man, we miss this train, I'm gonna shitcan you and just hire Charles Schulz.
Oh my God. Who are you, Larry fucking Flynt? What are you gonna do with all of those?
Read the articles. What do you think I'm gonna do with them? They're stroke books, stupid!
You've got like thirty books there! We're only going to be gone for two days!
Variety's the spice of life. I like a wide selection. Sometimes I'm in the mood for nasty close-ups, sometimes I like them arty and air-brushed. Sometimes it's a spread brown-eye kind of night, sometimes it's girl-on-girl time. Sometimes a steamy letter will do, sometimes - not often, but sometimes - I like the idea of a chick with a horse.
Okay, I'm telling you, she's never even been with a guy, much less these two fucking zeroes.
I'm telling you the bitch could be a bigger fucking germ farm than that monkey in Outbreak.
What is it about this girl man? You know you have no shot at getting her into bed. Why do you bother wasting time with her? Because you're Holden fucking McNeil, the most persistent traveler on the road that's *not* the path of least resistance. Everything's gotta be a fucking challenge for you and this little relationship with that *bitch* is a prime example of your fucking condition. Well, I don't need a magic 8-ball to look into your future. You want a forecast? Here, will Holden ever fuck Alyssa? Oh, what a shock, ""Not fucking Likely."" This relationship is affecting you, our work and our friendship and the time's gonna come when I throw down the gauntlet and say it's me or her. Then what are you gonna say?
I think you should let this one go.
No, what would you say? Would you trash twenty years of fucking friendship because you got some idiotic notion that this chick would even let you sniff her panties, let alone fuck her?
Look fucking asshole, I'm telling you, okay, let it go!
What the fuck, man! What the fuck makes this bitch all that important?
'Cause I'm fucking in love with her, man, okay?
How do you manage to get away with this all the time? I mean, shouldn't the cops be busting your head open right about now?
Wrong coast.
What does it matter if I refer to her as a dyke? Or if I call the Whalers a bunch of faggots in the privacy of my own office, far from the sensitive ears of the rest of the world?
I'm going to prove to you beyond the shadow of a doubt that Archie is all about pussy.
You're mucking with a G, you fuckin' tracer.
I'll trace a chalk line around your dead fucking body, you fuck!
Will you get him out of here!
Hey wait a second! He jumped me, you fucking tracer!
YOUR MOTHER'S A TRACER!
Fucking is not limited to penetration, Banky. For me it describes any sex, when it's not totally about love. I don't love Kim, but I'll fuck her. I'm sure you don't love every girl you sleep with.
Some of them I downright loathe.
So, uh, what do you wanna do tonight?
I dunno. Get a pizza, watch ""Degrassi Jr. High"".
You got a weird thing for Canadian melodrama.
I got a weird thing for girls who say, ""Aboot.""
Now *that*, my friend, is a shared moment.
Fuck you.
Not even if you let me video tape it.
All every woman really wants, be it mother, senator, nun, is some serious deep-dickin'.
Let me ask you a question. Can men fuck each other?
What, are you asking for my permission?
In your estimation.
Sure.
So, for you, to fuck is to penetrate. You're used to the more traditional definition. You inside some girl you duped, jackhammering away, not noticing that bored look in her eyes.
Hey, I always notice that bored look in their eyes, alright?
How should I sign this?
I don't want you to sign it, man. I want the guy that draws Bluntman and Chronic to sign it.
You're just a tracer.
Tell him, little shaver.
What the fuck is going on here?
I'm starting a new page?
Not with this shit, with you. What the fuck is going on with you and that girl?
We're just friends!
She's programming you!
I beg your pardon? Programming?
Yeah, and apparently you don't even fucking realize it!
And then, Black Beauty couldn't take it any longer and he finally did some of his own mounting.
Can I explain the audience principle to you? If you insult and accost them, then we have no audience!
He started it! Fucking cock-knocker! He's lucky I didn't put my pen through his thorax!
So where's your better half?
Takin' a piss. The guy's got a bladder like an infant.
That's funny. He says you're hung like an infant.
Does his mother tell him everything?
You seemed weirded out back there.
That was my couch you were fucking on.
Sorry.
I wanted to watch some T.V. Hard to do when your best friend's wrapped around his naked rug muncher on your couch.
She had boxers on.
You're way too conservative for that girl. She's been around and seen things we've only read about in books.
This is all gonna end badly.
I feel a hate crime coming on.
You gotta handle it like CNN and the Weather Channel: constant updates.
I need to sell the image to sell the book. I mean, would the audience still buy the whole black rage angle if they found out the book was written by a... you know...
Faggot?
When you say it, it sounds so sexy.
Holden!
What?
Let's go!
You see that dent in the hood of your car?
Son of a bitch!
Everybody has an agenda, alright? Everyone.
Bring on the free hooch!
Fucking faggot, man! Did you *see* that? Your dyke-courting ass just got me scored on.
Here.
What?
I want you to go down to the corner store, and buy yourself a clue.
Catholic school girls. The uniform's what does it for me. I wish I had've went with more Catholic school girls when I was a kid. As it stands I have no, ""And then she unzipped her jumper,"" stories.
What did I tell you? She just needs the right guy.
How was your pseudo date?
Leave it alone.
That chick bugs me.
No, everyone bugs you.
She's never even been with a guy.
That's what she says.
I suppose you're both wondering why I asked you over here tonight.
I just figured you'd wanna tell her to fuck off with me here so you wouldn't have to go through the story again later.
Fuck you
Not even if you let me videotape it
I'm only going to tell you this once. Shut up.
We gotta beat that traffic, huh?
What traffic? It's 1:30 in the morning!
And rush hour starts in six hours. Let's go."
Ed,H,Bromantic Foil,"'Purple Rain'?
No.
'Sign o' the Times'?
Definitely not.
The 'Batman' soundtrack?
Throw it.
'Dire Straits'?
Throw it.
Ooh, 'Stone Roses'.
Um, No.
'Second Coming'.
I like it!
Ahhh! 'Sade'.
Yeah, but that's Liz's!
Yeah, but she did dump you.
Oh!
What's the plan then?
Right.
We take Pete's car, we drive over to Mum's, we go in, take care of Philip - ""I'm so sorry, Philip"" - then we grab Mum, we go over to Liz's place, hole up, have a cup of tea and wait for this whole thing to blow over.
Why have we got to go to Liz's?
Because we do.
But she dumped you!
I have to know if she's all right!
Why?
Because I love her!
All right... gayyy... I'm not staying there, though.
Why not?
If we hole up, I wanna be somewhere familiar, I wanna know where the exits are, and I wanna be allowed to smoke.
Okay.
We take Pete's car, go round Mum's, go in, deal with Philip - ""Sorry, Philip!"" - grab Mum, go to Liz's, pick her up, bring her back here, have a cup of tea and wait for this whole thing to blow over.
Perfect!
No, no, no, no, no, wait, we can't bring her back here.
Why not?
Well, it's not really safe, is it?
Yeah, look at the state of it.
Where's safe? Where's familiar?
Where can I smoke?
Take car. Go to Mum's. Kill Phil - ""Sorry."" - grab Liz, go to the Winchester, have a nice cold pint, and wait for all of this to blow over. How's that for a slice of fried gold?
Yeah, boyyyeee!
He's not my boyfriend!
It might be a bit warm, the cooler's off.
Thanks, babe.
Any zombies out there?
Don't say that!
What?
That!
What?
The zed-word. Don't say it!
Why not?
Because it's ridiculous!
All right... are there any out there, though?
I can't see any. Maybe it's not as bad as all that.
Oh, no, there they are.
What's up, niggas?
Shaun?
Yeah?
You see what I'm saying?
Yep, totally.
I know he's your best friend, but you do live with him.
I know.
It's not that I don't like Ed.
Ed, it's not that I don't like you.
It's all right.
It would just be nice if we could...
Fuck!
...spend a bit more time together...
Bollocks!
...just the two of us.
Cock it!
It's just with Ed here, it's no wonder I always bring my flat-mates out and then that only exacerbates things.
What do you mean?
Well you guys hardly get on, do you?
No, what does ""exacerbate"" mean?
It means um, to make things worse.
Right. Well I mean, it's not that I don't like David and Di.
Guys, it's not that I don't like you.
, :

It's all right.
, :

It's all right.
And it's not that I don't want to spend time with you cause I do. It's just... Ed doesn't have too many friends.
Can I get... any of you cunts... a drink?
It's four in the fucking morning!
It's Saturday!
No, it's not. It's fucking Sunday. And I've got to go to fucking work in four fucking hours 'cos every other fucker in my fucking department is fucking ill! Now can you see why I'm SO FUCKING ANGRY?
Fuck, yeah!
We're coming to get you, Barbara!
Hey, Shaun, look who it is!
Fuck-a-doodle-do!
What happened to your hand, man?
I got mugged on the way home.
By who?
I dunno by some crackheads or something, one of them bit me.
Why'd they bite you?
I don't know, I didn't stop to ask them! Now, I have a splitting headache, and your stupid hip hop isn't helping. And the front door is open... AGAIN!
It's not hip hop, it's Electro. Prick... Next time I see him, he's dead.
Do you want anything from the shop?
Cornetto.
Do you want your messages?
What?
Well, your mum rang about you going around tomorrow night, and then Liz rang about the two of you eating out tonight, and then your mum rang back to see if I wanted to eat her out tonight.
*What*?
I'm not staying here.
David, don't, that's suicide.
I think you should go.
Who died and made you fucking king of the zombies?
Feel free to step in any time!
You did all right.
I didn't want to cramp your style.
Are you all right?
Come on, let's just go.
Hello?
He's going to be dead either way.
Ed, that's not the point!
Oh, thank God for that.
Goodbye, Ed. Love you.
Cheers!
I love you too, man.
Gaaayy!
Some men tried to get into the house.
Well are they still there?
I'm not sure, we've shut the curtains.
Did you try the police?
Well I thought about it.
Are you OK? Did they hurt you?
No I'm fine. I'm fine.
Mum...
Well they were a bit... bitey.
Mum, have you been bitten?
No... But Philip has.
Oh, OK.
Has she been bitten?
No, Philip has.
Oh, OK.
Listen, Mum, what sort of state is he in?
Oh, he's fine. Bit under the weather.
I see.
What's the deal?
We may have to kill my step-dad.
Why didn't you just shoot him, man?
Ed, for the last time...
I fucking knew it!
Don't forget to kill Philip!
Pete? Pete?
Why don't we just go up?
No. No. Wait. No. No! Don't go up there!
Why not?
Because A, he might be one of them, and B, he might still be annoyed. Pete? Maybe he went into work.
Well, how come he didn't drive? His keys are still here.
Well, maybe he got a lift; he said he wasn't feeling very well. Pete?
OI, PRICK!
, :

He's not in.
, :

He's not in.
Well maybe one should do the other, and then do themselves.
Oh maybe you should do me, I'll only muck it up if I have to do myself.
You know, I don't think I've got it in me to shoot my flatmate, my mum, and my girlfriend all in the same night.
What makes you think I'd have taken you back?
Well... You don't want to die single do you?
That's it. I would like to be shot.
Besides, I've changed. I haven't had a fag since yesterday, I promise!
He hasn't!
Player two has entered the game.
Ed!

I don't think he'd leave us, Davs.
Wouldn't he? Lizzy, how can you put your faith in a man you spectacularly binned for being unreliable? A man whose idea of a romantic nightspot and an impenetrable fortress are the same thing? It's... This is a pub! We are in a pub! What are we going to do now?
We could get a round in.
To recap, it is *vital* that you stay in your homes. Make no attempt to reach loved ones, and avoid all physical contact with the assailants.
Do you believe everything you hear on TV?
See? You don't need Liz to have a good time.
Oh, don't, man.
No! Go ahead, look at me. Can I just say one more thing? I'm not gonna say, you know, there's plenty more fish in the sea. I'm not going to say if you love her, let her go. And I'm not going to bombard you with clichés. But what I will say is this?
It's not the end of the world.
You still haven't met his mum?
Not yet!
Don't you get on with your mum, Shaun?
It's not that I don't get on with her...
Are you ashamed by your mum, Shaun?
No! I love my mum!
I love his mum too.
Ed!
She's like butter!
Ed!

I'm not a chartered accountant!
Well, you look like one!
YEAH!
I'm a lecturer.
You're a twat!
YEAH!
I've got nothing.
Shaun, what's going on?
Shit, it's engaged!
How about an ambulance?
It's engaged, Ed.
A fire engine?
It's one number, Ed, and it's busy! Okay? What you want a fire engine for, anyway?
Anything with flashing lights, you know?
My, how you've grown!
Yeah, you'd better believe it.
Two seconds!
Oi! What are you doing?
What am I doing? What are you doing, you stupid moron?
Fuck off!
You fuck off! Fuck fucking off! I've spent... look at me! I've spent my entire life sticking my neck out for you and all you ever do is fuck things up! Fuck things up and make me look stupid! Well, I'm not going to let you do it any more. OK? Not today!
Shaun!
What?
Oh.
All right, what about her, then?
Ooooooh... cockacidal maniac. Ex-porn star. She's done it all. They say she starred in the world's first interracial hardcore loop...
Café au lait...
... pour vous!
They still out there?
Yeah. What you think we should do?
Have a sit down?
Whoa, mama!
Christ! What the hell do you think you're doing?
Chill out. Everyone's all right.
Stop telling me to chill out!
Oh! Hello! Who's a pretty boy, then?
You didn't tell me Barbara had a Jag. I've always wanted to drive one of those.
Yeah, well, it's Philip's, okay? He won't let anybody near it. Honestly, I put half a Mars bar in the glove box once and he chased me around the garden with a bit of wood.
Fuck. It's gorgeous.
You gonna thank me then?
For what?
Tidying up!
Doesn't look that tidy.
Well, I had a few beers when I finished.
What are we going to eat?
Toasties!
There's a Breville out back.
Great. Saved by nibbles.
I'm sorry, Shaun.
It's OK.
No, I'm *sorry*, Shaun.
What?
Oh, God, that's rotten!
I'll stop doing it when you stop laughing!
I am not laughing!
Who the hell put this on?
It's on random.
For fuck's sake!
Big Al says so.
Yeah, but Big Al says dogs can't look up!
There's a girl in the garden.
What?
In the garden, there is a girl.
Don't point that gun at my mum!
Don't point that gun at Barbara!

Don't point that gun at my mum!
Don't point that gun at Barbara!

Arthur Bach,Y,Ditz,"My Name is Lillian and I am an alcoholic. I'm rich, I'm fabulously rich. I'm also generous and kind hearted. My father died when I was young and my mother was absent most of the time. Is this an excuse for making a mockery of my life? Oh it all looks very wild from the outside, I once went to bed with three European Princesses at the same time but A, I cant remember anything about it, and B, apparently I vomited over two of them before losing control of my bladder on the third, oh yes all such fun. Until the fog parts and suddenly there's a hole so big that all the vintage champagne and all the bat mobiles on the world can't fill it. Then I'm all alone on my magnetic bed, wondering what venereal disease I've just caught.
Always the quiet ones.
We shouldn't get married... we have nothing in common. You love horses. I don't trust them. Their shoes are permanent. Who makes that kind of a commitment to a shoe?
You're drunk again Arthur
No... I have remained drunk since our last encounter
Why didn't you tell me before?
I didn't want you to feel bad.
Why are you telling me now?
Because I want you to feel bad.
Could I stay for a minute, please?
Why?
Because it will reduce the proportion of my life that I spend feeling totally miserable.
Tiffany, this is my nanny Hobson, my best friend in the whole world.
Your nanny?
Hes merely shaped like an adult.
What was that?
A French kiss.
Really? Because the French always surrender, that was decidedly German.
I wouldn't recommend letting him get used to your breasts dear, hes got an addictive personality. He was at mine till he was six.
Hobson!
I had to dab tabasco on the nipples to see him off
That lady has never once breastfed me
Despite his best efforts.
You're running from yourself Arthur.
I wish I was, because I'd let me get away.
I'm going to take a bath.
I'll alert the media.
Grape shears, what an innovation! You can use them for my castration!
Congratulations, you're winning the dead parent game. But it's not too late to run home and butcher my mother.
Could you detach the half-naked business woman from under my bed?
I know what a jobs are, Snobson.
Hello Hobson!
Morning Arthur. And Friend.
Tiffany.
Ohhh, Points for knowing her name and saying it with confidence.
I made a Mental association with my lamp.
Who wouldn't want to marry a sexy clown.
I'm talking about Tuscany! White truffle gelato! Have you ever tried white truffle gelato? It makes all other gelato taste like shit.
First your father and then the horse - when will my testicles get some rest?
Look! It's orphan Annie, but as a man. Orphan Mannie!"
Nick,Y,Ditz,"Now, give me the fucking code.
Alright. 69-69-69.
You gotta be fucking kidding me.
What the fuck? Is that thing real?
Chet, if I don't get to the money in time. This thing gonna blow.
And your first though was to come to a school, filled with young children
Okay, climb through the window.
You climb through the window!
No, I'm holding the bag.
I'm holding the bomb!
Guess what? You just brought a gun to a bombfight, officer!
Now, listen to me... We're obviously, uh, stealing the car! And you won't report it stolen until later tonight, let's say... 5 o'clock. Or 6, to be safe!
6:15!
Yeah, right! 6:15.
Don't even bother calling the cops! We own the cops!
Why did that engine explode?
Remember that bomb I was telling you about? I kind of typed in the code, reactivated it and put in the back of that guy's van.
What? That's some John McClane shit! Yes!
How did you remember the code?
It doesn't matter. We are alive, and we are rich.
Okay, what if we saw off both of your arms, slip the vest over your head, than go to the hospital, they'll re-attach your arms. We'll just keep your arms on ice the whole time.
Fuck that!
I don't know what to do, man. All these sites have different shit. There's not a lot of consensus in the bomb disarming community. What did they do in the Hurt Locker?
You wanna fuck my sister?
I said your sister was sexually attractive.
Uh, my twin sister? Which is basically like fucking me?
Remember graduation night?
When you were nailing Tina Scotto?
Actually, I was having the best night of my life with your sister.
EVERYBODY! GET DOWN ON THE GR...
Shhh! Jesus!
Everybody! Get down on the ground NOW and go get us our money!
Uh, how are they supposed to get the money when you just told them...
Go get us our money and THEN everybody get down on the ground!
You're twins. Did you feel it when I was fucking her?
I taught myself how to do this shit. Went online, looked all this up!
Oh I hear ya. I taught myself how to eat pussy and cut my own hair!
You're late.
No, no, I'm 45 minutes late, which is, like 10 minutes early for me."
Henry Roth,Y,Ditz,"It's gonna be alright, Luce.
Don't call me Luce. I barely know you.
Sweetie, you're sorta dating him.

Sorry I'm not better looking.
Appreciate your time. Not everybody would have stopped like you. You're real sweet.
Oh, yeah. Thank you.
Okay.
Okay.
Hah! I can't believe you fell for that!
Well... my grandfather died while trying to jump-start a car...
Oh... I'm so sorry. I was just joking around.
I can't believe you fell for THAT!
Happy birthday, sir. What are you, like, 200 today?
So, you must be Lucy's friend. The one who made the tape.
I think he's more than my friend. You're my boyfriend, right?
Yes, ma'am.
So every day you help her to realize what happened and you wait patiently for her to be okay with it... then you get her to fall in love with you again?
Yes, ma'am.
Gosh!
You asshole! You don't even open the fricking car door for me anymore.
You're in trouble!
I gotta go tinkle.
Yeah, that's right. Take that! And that! And that! And that! And that!
You got him. You got him. Enough. Enough.
Are you okay?
Yes.
Okay, I'll be right back. Hey! Come here!
No, no, no. I think he's had enough. I'm sorry.
My eye!
You got him!
Not good enough.
Oh, Kamehameha!
He learned his lesson!
And now ladies and gentlemen I would like to introduce you to our most distinguished clinical subject: Tom
Hi, I'm Tom.
Henry.
Marlin.
Doug.
Lucy.
Hi. Oh, those are cool flip flops. Where did you get them?
You like those? It's interesting story. I was over on the North Shore the other day...
Hi, I'm Tom.
Henry.
Hi.
Marlin.
Hey, Mr. Peanut Butter Cups!
Hey, Mr. Could-Kill-Me-In-One-Punch!
Thanks buddy. What does it mean, again?
Bring me back a t-shirt
Can I have that? I need something to wipe my ass with.
Ha ha ha. Shut up!
See what happens when you play with sharks.
Sharks are like dogs, they only bite when you touch their private parts.
All I know about walruses is that out of all mammals they have the second largest penis. I have the first.
That's my joke.
Did Alicia marry that guy?
yea.
Doug, did you win the Mr. Hawaiian contest?
I didn't know there wath gonna be a urine tethst.
Did we have sex?
No, we didn't. Just so everyone knows
We want to!
Just kidding.
Okay, this is her. Start beating me up. Make it look good.
Give me your wallet. Okay, haole, what do you think? You can come to this island, eat our pineapple.
Help me! Not so hard. Take it easy.
Try to bang our women. Making my sister clean your hotel room.
Okay. What does that have to do with this? Relax. Hey! Hey! Help me, please!
Stupid haole!
Are you staring at me or her? 'Cause you're starting to freak me out.
Settle down and eat your pancakes, huh.
I don't think that's an option, Lisa.
Linda.
I know. I changed your name for your protection.
Pardon me. Sorry to interrupt, but I notice we were both eating alone and I thought perhaps I could sit with you, maybe build a syrup Jacuzzi for your waffle house?
Oh, that would be nice, but I have a boyfriend. I'm sorry.
You're making up a boyfriend so you can get rid of me?
No. I'm not.
What's his name then?
Ringo.
Is his last name, Starr?
No. McCartney.
The Beach Boys? How nice of that man to give me a CD that will remind me of all the wonderful times I shared with his daughter. What an asshole!
WHY would you do this to me?
Oh my god, is he trying to tell me something?
Can I ask you guys something? What's gonna happen down the line? Someday she's gonna wake up and look in the mirror and notice her face's aged ten years overnight.
You know something, Henry? I worry about that every day of my damn life.
Ula! Get back to cleaning the pool! And if that's one of your special brownies, don't let any of the dolphins eat that!
How do you think I get the dolphins to do double-flips and play with the white kids?
Hey! Tattoo Face!
Hey, Peanut Butter Cups!
You know, why don't you try this? It's a kind of hinge.
Now, why didn't I think of that?
You're too close to the object. Don't be too hard on yourself.
You're right. Sometimes you need an outsider's perspective.
Fresh eye never hurts.
I'm Lucy.
Yes. I'm Henry Roth. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Wait, uh... What is going on? I was kidding around with you! What's happening here? Is she crazy or something?
Lucy is a very special person. Very different from other people.
Okay.
About a year ago, Lucy was in a terrible car accident. She and her father went up North Shore to get a pineapple. Her Father broke some ribs, but Lucy suffered a serious head injury. She lost her short term memory.
So she can't remember anything?
No, no, no. She has all of her long term memory. That's a different part of the brain. Her whole life, up to the night before the accident, she remembers. She just can't retain any new information. It's like her slate gets wiped clean every night while she sleeps.
Hold on, here. This sounds like something I would tell a psycho girl so she would stop calling me. Am I the psycho girl?
I wish I was making this up! She has no memory that she ever met you.
What about the pineapple thing?
She says that every day, because each morning she wakes up thinking it's October thirteenth of last year. She comes here for breakfast because that's what she did on Sundays, and October thirteenth was a Sunday. She has no idea it's more than a year later.
She reads the newspaper though.
It's a special paper her Father puts on their porch every night. It's from the day of her accident. He got hundreds of them printed up. Lucy does the same thing everyday.
Okay, pal. When she stops, just let her pet you. Look cute. Go to the middle of the road. Thank you. Right there. Perfect.
Oh, shit.
Here she comes. Smile. Where is she? Oh, my God! Oh no! Okay that didn't work. Shit your pants? So did I!
The part of you for this reenactment will be played by my good friend, Ula.
Aloha. Sorry about your brain.
Do you have any idea who I am?
No.
No. That sucks.
Really? Even though in 10-15 years she could possibly let herself go and then sex would be like, nauseating, for you?
What, are you nuts? Your wife's right over there.
I'm just kidding, Muumuu!
Hey, Dad.
Not now, Keanu Mokokokakau.
But your stitches are bleeding.
It must have been my huge back swing. You think you can stitch me up tonight after I get back from surfing?
Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.
I wouldn't surf with a bleeding wound like that. You might attract a shark or something.
What's wrong with that, cuz? Sharks are naturally peaceful.
Is that right? How'd you get that nasty cut anyway?
A shark bit me.
Nice! Go smoke another one, bro!
Actually I'm going on a trip in a little while to study undersea Pacific walrus behaviors.
Thounds kind of fruity.
Thank you.
How long'th it going to take?
Uh... about a year.
I gueth you won't mith days like thith.
Well, maybe days like this don't have to be so bad.
What are you trying to say?
Well, when you guys tell her, she's not just finding out about the accident. She's finding out that her life is basically a setup. I think that's what freaks her out the most.
Oh, you're an exthpert now?
No. I'm just saying I wish there was another way besides: ""Sorry we couldn't trick you today. Here's some pictures of your broken head.""
You wanna broken head, huh thmart guy?
Why? You gonna give it to him?
No, Daddy, I thought you wath gonna do it.
Nobody's gotta break my head, guys. I'm gonna split anyways.
Don't go just 'cause my thon is thychotic.
Good night. Sweet dreams. Keep 'em dry there Doug.
Very funny.
I don't know who you are, Henry... but I dream about you almost every night.
Why?
What would you say if I told you that notebook you read every day used to have a lot of stuff about me in it?
I would say that that makes a lot of sense.
You erased me from your memories because you thought you were holding me back from having a full and happy life. But you made a mistake. Being with you is the only way I could have a full and happy life. You're the girl of my dreams... and apparently, I'm the man of yours.
Henry. It's nice to meet you.
Lucy, it's nice to meet you too.
Hi, I'm Tom!
Ha-ha-ha... Shut up.
I bet you twenty bucks, I can get her to have breakfast with me again.
You're on.
Good morning. Lucy! Lucy! Hey, hey, hey. Okay, I know this is hard for you to understand right now, but we are actually seeing each other.
What are you doing?
Nothing, I was just getting some lint off for you...
You were going for a feelski!
All right, I'm sorry... But this is like the twenty third time we've made out already and... they're getting blue!
What the hell is wrong with you?
Just keep going, I'll give you twenty dollars.
You got it. How's your balls?
Killing me. Hit it.
Thith ith from Nick and Thue. They thend their betht witheth for a thafe trip.
That's very nice. Spam and Reese's. All right.
I love Thpam and Reethe's, can I have it?
Um, I guess.
Doug!
Little Sammy Sosa's a bit shook up, but she'll be okay. She's watching the tape as we speak.
Good. How's my temporal lobe looking there, Doc?
Don't worry. You're not gonna suffer any short term memory loss. But was your head shaped like an egg before she hit you?
Hey! Don't make fun of Henry, all right? It'th not hith fault hith head'th thaped like that!
Note the intense overreaciton. That's the 'roids talking.
Here, you should try this out. Put this here. Swivelly door. Waffleonians can come in and out now.
Oh, are you from a country where it's okay to stick your fingers all over someone else's food?
Uh, no, I'm from this country.
Were you gonna eat that?
Okay, well, I had a great time.
Me too.
Okay.
Would you like to have breakfast again tomorrow morning, same time? Because I teach art class at ten.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
I wish I could make it, but, yes, I will be there.
Take care.
Okay.
One for the road. It is fishy.
Got you good. Aloha.
Aloha.
See you tomorrow. Oh, my God.
Oh, my goodness.
Shit. I had a bee on me.
Alright.
It was a big one.
Which means ""look at those two shit heads"".
I drew this, it's a picture of a father and son fishing off a fishing boat.
You don't speak English.
Remember to use a condom, or in your case, a Hefty bag.
Come on, I need some details. You get some booby, some assy, a pull on your poi-poi? Come on.
Daddy, what's a nympho?
Uh, the nympho is the state bird of Ohio.
You're the state idiot of Hawaii.
What's wrong with that turtle?
He has lung problems cause he smoked too much turtle weed, which is bad for you. Right Ula?
What? I don't smoke weed.
Let me ask you something, Alexa. If you made a promise to a girl's dad that you would not see her anymore... would you consider that like a binding promise?
Absolutely.
Yeah?
But then again, there are always ways around such things.
Like?
For example. If I promised a woman's father I would not see her... I would simply shut my eyes, while she serviced my manhood.
That's actually a cool way to look at it. And a very gross way.
Jocko, this is Lucy. Lucy, this is Jocko.
Wow! Thank you. Nice to meet you. He is awesome! He is so smart.
Check this out. Jocko, what does the teapot do when the water's ready? Very good.
Hey, can I ask him a question?
Go ahead.
Jocko, do you think that Henry and I are ready to take our relationship to the next level? You sure about that? And do you think that I should bring him into the other room and take advantage of him? I saw that hand gesture. And I'm glad you did it.
Really?
Stalker!
No, no, no. Don't you remember me a little?
Grandpa's here.
Hi dad.
I am grouchy due to lack of recent physical intimacy.
Oooo...
Shut up, because here comes one-time only opportunity. What I will do now is go into your office and become naked.
Next move is up to you. I may not be as limber as I once was... but yeah, I make up for it with enthusiasm and willingness to experiment.
I don't know if you realize, I'm not into guys.
And why is your foot on my pillow?
Sorry brah
And I don't want your ass on it either!
I need you to get me two fish from the barrel. Now.
Okay.
Just hang in there.
Here.
It's gonna be alright. That's a little warm. Go to the bottom of the barrel please. Okay, there. That's good. Thank you. Come on, buddy. Take it. Take it.
He's not responding!
I know, Alexa! Sorry I smacked you with that. You needed the fish-slap to calm down. Do you understand?
Yes.
Are you calm?
Yes. Fish-slap calm me.
Dude, I met this sexy blonde tax attorney from Florida at Starbucks today. I told her you the kahuna she wanna have fun on this island. You want her number?
You pimping tourists for me again, Ula?
Yes! I live vicariously through you, remember? My life sucks. Now, come on give her the Waikikiki sneaky behind the cheeky.
Actually I'm not drunk at all, Noreen, and neither are you, because there's no alcohol in these drinks. Sadly, I've used this technique many times. It helps lovely tourists such as yourself loosen up without impairing your ability to stay awake all night and have guilt free vigorous sex with me.
Wow!
I was petting my walrus all morning and I was thinking of you the whole time.
Okay, pervert. I think that you should leave.
What? I was just joking around because of what we talked about yesterday
Yesterday? I've never even met you.
You meet her, hang out, flirt, no commitment, nobody gets hurt.
She's got brain damage, you psycho.
Okay, I'll give you that one. But I think it'd be healthy for you. You haven't allowed yourself to connect with a girl for many years.
I appreciate your interest Ula, but leave me alone.
Hey, you'd be doing exactly what her father does: Giving her a wonderful day. Then when it's time for you to go on your big boat trip, poof, you just leave. She'll never even know you're gone.
See I'm not sure about the ""poofing"" part, because I'm not a very big poofer. Could you demonstrate a good poof for me.
Quit busting my coconuts for five seconds.
Alright. Would you stop poofing on that joint and do some work!
Okay. Let's get this sucker ready. Then we're gonna take her out for a spin.
Hi. Sorry for the delay. Should be a few minutes.
No problem. No worries.
Where are you coming form? Breakfast?
Yeah.
How was it?
I had waffles. They were delicious.
I like making little houses out of waffles.
You do?
That's my thing. What's your name?
Lucy.
Hi, I'm Henry.
Is this the guy?
Yeah. Mr. Roth, I have one simple request. Stay away from my daughter.
Absolutely. I just, I think I hurt her feelings and I don't want it to end like that.
Yeah, well, it's gonna end like this!
Calm down, little fella!
I'm gonna kill you. You're a dead man. Okay I'm calm! I'm calm!
I coulda whooped his ass, Daddy but this gravel - I siped on it a fwell.
Then maybe you need to do a little bit more butt flexes.
Cheap shot, Dad.
I'll see ya around.
Okay.
Really? That's it?
That's what?
All that flirting and phony ""I can't read"" stuff, and then you're not gonna ask me out or for my phone number?
I can't read.
Oh, shut up. That was one of the goofiest things I've ever seen in my life, but I thought, ""Hey, if this guy is so desperate to meet me, he might be worth talking to."" But then I get stiffed.
No, no, no, this is what happened. I...
Mahalo for the ego boost.
I'm gonna miss you buddy, but I gotta get the hell off this island.
You sure you don't want to take Doug with you?
Hey! What the heck are you guys doing here?
I just want to try something that will help her remember me.
Henry, come quickly, it's Jocko!
Alexa, get me two fish from the barrel
He's not responding.
Calm down. I'm gonna try to get him breathing manually so I need your face next to his mouth to see it if's working. Are you ready? 1, 2, 3!
Nothing, nothing.
Alright. I'm gonna try it one more time. One... two... three!
Yikes, that's a lot of vomit!
This is why I got into this business, to save sea animals.
Yeah, buddy. I knew you were gonna burp but the vomit thing was awesome! That's what she gets for eating my roast beef sandwich.
That was pathetic.
Yeah? Why don't you choke on your spam!
What did Sue say?
She said that if I talk to Lucy you'll kill me with a meat cleaver.
Officer, I think there's been a misunderstanding.
I don't."
Michael Newman,Y,Ditz,"Will you still love me in the morning?
Forever and ever, babe
Family, family... Family comes first.
Family comes first.
Honey... honeymoon
Honeymoon
I love you.
Samantha... I didn't make it to 200 but I love you.
I love you, Daddy.
No no, no no,

Consider the leprechaun.
What?
The one in the cereal commercials.
'They're magically delicious'?
That guy?
He's always chasing the pot of gold, but when he gets there, at the end of the day, it's just corn flakes.
I'm going to Derek's.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, who is Derek?
Uh, duh, my boyfriend, the hottest boy in school?
Yeah, he's gonna be really hot when I burn his house down.
Can I help you?
Hey Dad.
Hey Dad? Ben? Look how big you got! You're enormous!
Look who's talking, Captain Twinkie of the SS Fat Ass! Really good for my self esteem! Maybe if you took me to Pilates like you said you would, people wouldn't think I was Rosie O'Donnell!
Come on Ben, I love you! Bring me back the Twinkies!
Sorry I'm late. Some idiot in a red Lamborghini parked in my spot.
Prince Habeeboo drive Red Lamborghini.
Oh, did I say red Lamborghini? I meant blue Ferrari.
I thought I was already your partner.
Whoa, cowboy. I said ""Land the Watsuhita account, you'll get promoted."" I didn't mean right this second.
But I already told my wife, sir. I spent money I don't have. To do these documents is gonna take me months.
Then you better get started.
Wow, I just got a big headache! Wha - ? Was I hit by a train or something?
I didn't see anything.
Oh, I forgot to tell you. I hung out with your friend Janine this weekend.
I hope she's doing your brother right now, you big-headed buffoon
No, no, no, no. You got more.
Yeah.
Anyway, the sooner you ge - Get back to - Uh, work, they sooner you'll be partnerized. I taste shit.
You do?
Stacy! Did you put shit in my lunch? Argh!
I'm gonna get going, sir.
Ugh. STACY!
Daddy, how much longer are you going to live?
One minute.
One minute?
Daddy's gonna die in one minute?
Whoa! No no no, I'm not gonna die, okay? I'm gonna live... 200 more years, is that long enough for you and me?
You promise?
I promise!
Yes! Look at me. All showered and dressed and looking sexy. I like that. I...
Did you smoke crack, Daddy?
I mean no disrespect, Prince Hubbida Hubbida.
Hubba Bubba.
Habeeboo! Ha-bee-boo! Hubba Bubba is chewing gum. Prince Habeeboo is not chewing gum!
Samantha. One day, you are going to be the hottest chick in the world, but you still gotta have brains. So tomorrow, I'm going to teach you Calculus.
You know Calculus?
Uh, I knew you'd call me on that, alright, your mother will teach you.
He was a good man. I'm sorry, Michael. I didn't want to take him.
What?
Michael, I'm an angel.
I thought angels were supposed to protect people.
I'm the Angel of Death.
You look a little pale there, pal. Let me fix that.
You're all yellow from the scurvy. Arr, captain.
Grr... Don't get the Hulk angry. Raaaahrrr!
Oh, there's Barney.
I love you, you love me, the jogger has giant boobies.
Hey, Dad! Look at Kevin's new Robo-Dog!
That's nice.
NICE? This thing's worth more than your car!
Not anymore it ain't!
Do you need something, Mr. Newman?
Who are you?
Kirsten... your assistant?
Wha- Wha- What happen to Alice?
She moved to Accounting, couldn't handle your hours.
And she prefers to be called Allen now, remember?

No... No! No!
What kind of stereo do you have in that blue piece of shit?
You know, I never check, Kevin.
Yeah, well my father's stereo is a Bose.
Your father's stereo blows? That's too bad!
No! I said... That's not what I said!
His father stereo blows! Wheee!
How you doing, buddy? Playing some catch?
Actually, we're playing some drop, 'cause Ben hasn't caught one yet.
Darn it.
Ahh.
Ahh!
Ho-ho! You're a regular Derek Jeter yourself, O'Doyle.
MOMMY!
I was looking at our proposal. You know what? After getting to know you a little bit, I realize this is not what you're all about. In fact, let's just throw it out, all right. The river in the lobby idea, what an egghead move. Let's just keep all the plans simple, forget all the niceties, and maximize our revenue. That's what its all about anyways, the profits. But do me a favor. Just give us your account and your trust. That way we can get the hell out of this dump, go to a T.G.I. Friday's, and do some Jell-O shots 'til this guy pukes up a lung.
Fuck yeah!
Thank you, Mom for having me, I know it was a lot of pain.
You have no idea.
Hi, Dad. Sorry to bother you. Would you mind looking at my shopping mall design again? This one is cheaper, but... If you check this out, you'll see it has much better natural flow...
Cheaper one, like I said. Just, let me do my e-mail.
Yeah, yeah, you're right. Er...
He ain't right. You are a schmark, look at it!
Surprise!
Hey, grandpa!
Oh, my God...
How did you get so handsome?
So, Michael. I have a wonderful idea. Your mother is going to play canasta with her friends tonight, so I thought: ""What a great opportunity"". You, me and Ben should go and have a boys night out.
I can't.
What do you mean you can't? You have to weak some time. We can go, we can whistle the pretty ladies.
I'm down for that.
See? He's down. I don't know what that means but he's down.
Hey, please.
Don't give me that finger.
I'll make you a deal. If you come, I'll show you the quarter trick.
Will you look at the man?
I'll tell you the secret.
No, Dad.
Don't you wanna know...?
...how you do the stupid trick? I've always known. Can you let me do my job?
You've always known...
You're pathetic.
Okay... I'm so sorry I butched in. I love you son.
Don't you worry, grandpa. I'll go with you.
I love you dad.
I'll miss ya... You know that... Good-bye.
Like I Said, ""Good Guys Need A Break"". I know you'll do the right thing this time. Love Morty. P.S. Your Wife's Rockin' Body Still Drives Me Crazy.
Okay, Morty.
I guess when you combine mass quantities of cough syrup with yodels... you get acid.
Honey, you were so great.
Whoa, what are you, half a dolphin or something? That was incredible.
You just got here, Dad. I saw you.
What do you mean I just got here? Why are you saying that? I saw you. You jumped in there, you swam here.
Then what stroke was he doing, Dad?
He was doing the ""shut-up"".
That was great, son!
You're not my dad!
Only as far as you know, kid.
Are you really my dad?
Yeah!
Donna!
Donna - Oh, my God! I'm so horny now.
Oh, God. Get me out of here.
That's it! You're dead!
Oh, shit.
That's right! You better run! I kicked your father's ass in high school! So, now I'm gonna kick yours!
I hate that man.
Oh, my God. I want that so bad. A husband that I can kiss and love and give juice too.
You've already cheated on three different husbands with their brothers. I think you've given enough juice to everybody. Love juice.
You know way too much about me. I should've never done that Montel Williams show.
Even Montel Williams thinks you're crazy and he's seen a lot of shit.
I was desperate for companionship! All of my husbands... All of them have emotionally abandoned me.
They went to work. You had sex with their unemployed brothers. You're a horndog.
Aunt Peggy, is that you? God, you got old.
I'm just playing, she knows that.
Samantha, is that you? When did you get boobs?
Same time you did, Dad.
I'm gonna show you a remote we just got in that's probably the most advanced piece of technology that we have in this place.
Sounds sweet.
It is sweet. The latest, greatest universal remote not even on the market yet.
Ooh. I guess the O'Doyles' remote can kiss my advanced-technological ass then.
I don't know the O'Doyles, but... they can bite it hard.
That's not bad for your third liposuction. One more tummy tuck should take care of it.
Oh, it looks like a tongue... licking.
Once again, Michael left Donna in bed, confused and unsatisfied.
Shut up, James Earl Jones!
No! You shut up, bigmouth!
Oh, my God. Wolverine's goofy cousin.
You sell any universal remotes here?
For a shower curtain or a rug?
For a TV.
Hm, I don't think so, how about a blanket?
You have a remote control for a blanket?
Sorry dude, I don't really work here, I'm just waiting for my friends.
You're kidding.
Uh actually yes, I don't have any friends, will you be my friend?
I promise, I'm not going to work tonight, I'm going to stay home with you, and we're going to watch Dragon Tales.
Dragon Tales is for babies, Dad.
Yeah, let's go watch CSI.
Yeah! CSI!
It's the one where they find the lady's arm.
I missed the whole Dragon Tales era?
Who wants to have a pillow fight?
Yes?
You scared the...!
Honey, what's going on down there?
It's alright! I, uh...
It was a mouse! I killed it! It's dead! But...
It broke the table first.
How'd you get in here?
I had a feeling you wanted to see me.
I'm freakin' out. This thing - this thing - it's broken. It-it's just - it's fast forwarding on its own now.
It's not a malfunction it's a feature. It's using it's memory to execute your preferences.
It *remember's* stuff about me? What do you mean?
It's an advance piece of equipment like TiVo.
You could call it MeVo.
I fast forwarded through sex one time. I don't wanna skip it forever; I like sex. I-um-i-it-it feels good.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but you fast forwarded through an entire *year*. That's a lot of sex. Put it all together, it's like... thirty minute's worth for you.
Oh, no, no. So what? Everything I fast forwarded it-it's just gonna do it on its own now?
Pretty much. No more showering. No more traffic. No more arguing. No more sickness.
This is bad. This is bad. Here, you take it back.
I'm deactivating my service. I quit, I quit, I quit.
No, come on.
No, no, no. Thanks for everything, alright? But I -
You... this is not...
Come on, don't be mean.
Nice hat.
Whoa! Is this a *stick-up*, or are you just happy?
Oh, yeah? I'll take my clothes off. Then what's - ?
I wouldn't do that if I were you. There's only one place left for it to pop up.
My schmeckel got bigger now that I'm older, just so you guys know that.
It couldn't have gotten any smaller.
It looked like a little Tic Tac.
Yeah, come here. I'll freshen your breath.
I am the Angel of Death.
You bastard.
Hey, look at Sundance wrestle his duck.
Oh, no, that's not wrestling. That's... Something you shouldn't know about for another 10 to 30 years. Ten for you.
Thirty for you.
Hey, Micheal. Micheal, who are you talking to?
Jesus. I'm talking to my boss, Ma. Take it easy.
Oh, yeah? Well, tell him to get a life. You got family here. You're busy. Come on.
My mother says hello.
Twinkie. Don't need it. You don't need it, man. You do need a Yodel, though. Good job.
It took that son of a bitch a whole year to promote me?
Three days? Couldn't I have a little more time for this project?
Michael, our clients are Japanese. They can't wait for their fish to cook.
You've gotta show me how you do the quarter trick, it's driving me crazy!
A good magician never reveals his secrets... however, if you invite us over for dinner more often...
You can come over tomorrow night and the next night and the next night and whenever you want!
Change the channel!
Where am I?
You're at Bed, Bath, and Beyond. I was watching you sleep, you looked like you were having a crazy dream.
I'm back in the store?
You're not supposed to lay on the beds, but, I do sometimes.
Check it out. You hit the fast-forward button. I believe we're sometime after your conception.
No! We're in my mother's vagina?
I'm gonna be alone on the Fourth of July?
Mr. Ammer, if you need female companionship this weekend, my wife's friend, Janine, wow.
Really? What's she like?
Let's just say, uh... she will eat you up, sir.

Your first day as a partner, you come to work in a fricking bathrobe.
I - I did. I did. I - John, I just feel would should stop on wasting our energy on corporate brown nosing, and worrying who's got the better suit. Armani, Calvin Klein. Who cares? Let's concentrate on what really matters. The work.
That's the craziest thing I've ever heard. But goddamn it, you're right.
Life-changing. I feel freer.
Yeah. Uh, keep the pants on.
What was going on here, huh?
We thought you were sleeping, Daddy.
How can I sleep with two Twinkie burglers roaming around?
No problem, sir, there'll be other Junes in my life.
Uh uh uh, no cupcakes yet!
But I'm starving!
I know exactly how you feel, Michael, I'm so hungry, I could eat this quarter!
Ah, so THIS is where the quarter trick started.
How did he do that?
It's a trick coin you buy in a magic shop, I just couldn't ever let him know I knew that.
Something stinks like stale French fries.
Oh yeah, that's probably me.
You know, fast food *shortens* your life.
That's what they tell me, but the way my life's going right now, that wouldn't be so bad.
I'm on autopilot!
'I'm on autopilot', more like auto-zombie!
Ben, I promise you I'm going to finish the tree house and we are going to sleep in it next weekend! And you and I are going to exercise together and I'm not gonna wear a speedo!
Alright!
WILL YOU GIVE ME A BREAK ONE TIME?
Which of these turns on the TV?
Honey, I think you just opened the garage.
Just planning ahead.
Donna, I'm not out there drinking or gambling or hitting on chicks, I'm working my ass off so that my family can have a better life than I ever dreamed of having when I was a kid. And the only way for that to happen is for me to watch the freaking show! So relax, hon!
Linger by the Cranberries was the song playing during our first kiss, and you looked so hot in that pink sweater.
Michael! You remember what I was wearing?
Yeah, I remember what Janine was wearing, she scared the shit out of me then!
Pretty sweet, eh? Two queen beds, full kitchen, steam shower and satellite TV with surround sound.
Why are you always trying to hurt me? One day, I'm gonna hurt you back.
Michael Newman, I didn't know you smoked cigars.
And now's the time.
No, Kathy. This isn't mine. I took it out of Kevin's hands. Yeah, he was smoking like a chimney.
No, I wasn't!
I think, I smell marijuana in it.
Kevin O'Doyle, you get your ass in this house! RIGHT NOW!
I hate you!
Are you deaf? MOVE IT!
Mom, I swear!
I don't wanna have to ask you again!
Dope is for dopes, buddy!
Get your ass in this house!
Twinkie. You don't need e'm. You don't need e'm. You do need a Yodel, though.
Your mother must have had some good eyesight, 'cause... I didn't see anything.
Oh, hardy har-har.
Michael, like I said, good guys need a break. I know you'll do the right thing this time. Love, Morty P.S. Your wife's rockin' body still drives me crazy."
Chuck Levine,Y,Ditz,"The worst day we ever had on the job?
This little kid fell in a swimming pool...
Chuck was the first one there...
I dove in...
He pulled him out...
I worked on him...
worked on him, worked on him, but...
Larry stayed with me all that night. I just couldn't get... couldn't get that kid outta my head.
When my wife died.
Ah, that was the worst.
I collapsed.
He knew it was coming but...
What we have is beyond friendship.
He's the best man I know.
I'd do anything for him.
I love him.
I love him.
You know, Larry's heavyset. Is that the kind of guy you've always been attracted to?
Ah no, he's my first fattie.
You guys really seem like you have a lot of sexual chemistry.
I float his boat and he sinks mine.
You know what, I cannot deal with sleeping next to your stupid ugly face tonight, so don't bother coming in the bedroom.
Oh, wouldn't dream of it, honey!
You are a lousy best friend, and a shitty husband!
Hey! For the record, every time I laughed at one of your jokes, I was faking it.
You're a monster!
Chuck, we really pulled this one out our asses.
Bad choice of words there, Larry. Bad choice of words.
Going in straight.
Coming out... gay?
Domestic partnership.
Domestic partnership? You mean like faggots?
No, I mean yeah but, no, not us. Obviously. Just on paper.
Paper faggots?
Well, the accepted vernacular is ""gay""... but yes.
Going in alive.
Coming out the same way.
What do you got?
Maxi Pads.
What, do we have vaginas now? Put it back!
I'm not an animal! I'm a whore! You don't want to marry the town whore. Believe me, you're better than that.
Chuck. What's going on, man?
Brace yourself, Larry. What I'm gonna tell you is pretty rough. They removed your entire body. You're nothing but a head now.
What?
They said that there was enough fat in your head to rebuild you a new body, so they got scientists in the other room working on it. God willing, you're gonna be alright.
Oh, you know, you're such a dick.
Gay guys know how to dance good. It's like the law or some shit.
Civil or religious?
Religious. I'm Jewish, I don't wanna piss my mother off.
I'm Catholic, I don't wanna piss Mel Gibson off.
The only thing I'm doing with my eyes is putting a bag over your head, you toothless moron!
Let's go junior high on them.
Oh my God, it's homo-palooza!
Holy Shamo!
I'm sorry I can't get out of bed.
There's a bed under there?
Can you walk at all?
I haven't walked in five years!
Alright, maybe we strap a rocketship on this guy we'll get him outta here.
No, no, we can do this, People lift cars, it's adrenaline, you know.
Cars? This guy is more like a freaking minivan.
Hey, buddy we're gonna help you outta here, come on.
How's my mom?
If she survived the birthing process, nothing's gonna take her down.
Let me chop him off, we'll take him down in pieces.
What?
I'm kidding.
Just grab the back of our coats.
Hey, did you start this fire by lighting one of your farts?
That's funny.
I'm running momma, I'm running like the wind.
Chuck, you alright?
Oh my god, oh sweet Lord, broccoli!
That's how we roll in our house, baby.
Larry - Chuck's better half.
Two-thirds, actually.

Do you do me...?
Oh you couldn't handle it little man.
Hai.
Hey, Big Ragu! I smell your feet from here. I like it.
Oh... He thinks my feet stink.
Now that's a stink.
Uncle Chuck, you left this in the kitchen.
Hey, don't you look at that!
Actually, you know what, give me that, maybe he should look at it
Stop it, Chuck.
It's an experiment, seriously. Eric, see how this makes you feel. Open it up.
Alright, that didn't go well.
Look, this is the only way I can keep doing what I do and make sure my kids are protected.
Larry, look at us, we're not gay! But if we were gay, don't you think I'd be with someone a little hotter-looking than you? I'm Mr February, for God's sake. It would be like the Prom King fooling around with a tuba player.
Oh great, I play tuba.
Larry, I love you, but I'm not in love with you, if that makes any sense. I still want to be friends."
Prince Yu,AF,Evil Prince,"So you are leaving. Are you afraid?
You are my mother, Your Majesty.
We have been intimate for three years. You, of all people should know who I am.
I am first and foremost my father's son.

Mother!
I am not your mother!"
Crown Prince Leopold,AF,Evil Prince,"Well done.
Thank you for coming. I hope you enjoyed it.
Oh, we more than enjoyed it. Stimulated great debate among us, hasn't it? Except of course for your assistant Duchess Von Teschen. You seem to have struck her quite speechless. A feat in itself. Did you hypnotize her?
In a fashion.
I'd like to learn that trick. Rainer here seems to think you have supernatural powers. Do you claim supernatural powers?
I've never said anything of that kind.
Then you won't mind a question or two?
Now let's not ruin it.
You needn't divulge anything I can't guess.
As you wish.
Your assistants are behind the mirrors somewhere, in robes obviously. Lights in the frame perhaps to illuminate them, or angled mirrors.
That would be one way to do it.
I think I understand it all except the ghost. That was very, very good.
Another viewing, perhaps?
You must come to the Hofburg next time. We'll make an evening of it.
That would be my pleasure.
So be it.
Sophie?
And we'll gather our best minds next time. You'll really have a challenge then.
Then I shall prepare something special. Perhaps I'll make you disappear.
What do you want?
Nothing.
Then you shall get nothing.
You're late.
My apologies, your Highness. I was attending to loose ends of the case.
Are there still loose ends?
Very few.
Did he do it again?
How does he do it?
I'm afraid I still don't know.
Did you ask him?
He's not talking at this point.
Well, I'm sure you have methods for that kind of thing. I want you to put an end to it. Surely you have something on him. Something from his past?
He has tricked you, it is all an illusion!
Perhaps there is truth in this illusion.
How do I look?
Ordinary, sir. Very ordinary.
As you know... we some times follow Duchess Von Teschen for her protection... Yesterday she was seen in the company of another man...
What man?
Eisenheim, the illusionist.
What were they doing?
Well they were meeting and uh...
Touching? Kissing?... Fornicating?
I want you to put and end to it.
I know you've been with him.
It has nothing to do with you.
It has EVERYTHING to do with me!
And you? Can you even bear children? Are you any use at all?
Has he tricked you? Is that it?
No, Your Highness.
Then why are you failing me? I thought I could trust you. I thought you were a man I could bring with me when I took the throne. Am I wrong about you?
No. You're not wrong, Your Highness. No.
I need men who can complete the tasks assigned to them!
Instead I am surrounded by fools. In the end I must do everything myself. I can see this case will be no different."
Commodus,AF,Evil Prince,"Rise. Rise.
Your fame is well deserved, Spaniard. I don't think there's ever been a gladiator to match you. As for this young man, he insists you are Hector reborn. Or was it Hercules? Why doesn't the hero reveal himself and tell us all your real name? You do have a name.
My name is Gladiator.
How dare you show your back to me! Slave, you will remove your helmet and tell me your name.
My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius, commander of the Armies of the North, General of the Felix Legions and loyal servant to the TRUE emperor, Marcus Aurelius. Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife. And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next.
Arms!
The general who became a slave. The slave who became a gladiator. The gladiator who defied an emperor. Striking story! But now, the people want to know how the story ends. Only a famous death will do. And what could be more glorious than to challenge the Emperor himself in the great arena?
You would fight me?
Why not? Do you think I am afraid?
I think you've been afraid all your life.
I knew a man once who said, ""Death smiles at us all. All a man can do is smile back.""
I wonder, did your friend smile at his own death?
You must know. He was your father.
You loved my father, I know. But so did I. That makes us brothers, doesn't it? Smile for me now, brother.
Are you ready to do your duty for Rome?
Yes, father.
You will not be emperor.
Which wiser, older man is to take my place?
My powers will pass to Maximus, to hold in trust until the Senate is ready to rule once more. Rome is to be a republic again.
Maximus?
Yes.
My decision disappoints you?
You wrote to me once, listing the four chief virtues: Wisdom, justice, fortitude and temperance. As I read the list, I knew I had none of them. But I have other virtues, father. Ambition. That can be a virtue when it drives us to excel. Resourcefulness, courage, perhaps not on the battlefield, but... there are many forms of courage. Devotion, to my family and to you. But none of my virtues were on your list. Even then it was as if you didn't want me for your son.
Oh, Commodus. You go too far.
I search the faces of the gods... for ways to please you, to make you proud. One kind word, one full hug... where you pressed me to your chest and held me tight. Would have been like the sun on my heart for a thousand years. What is it in me that you hate so much?
Shh, Commodus.
All I've ever wanted was to live up to you, Caesar. Father.
Commodus. Your faults as a son is my failure as a father.
Father. I would have butcher the whole world... if you would only love me!
Have I missed it? Have I missed the battle?
You have missed the war.
Father, congratulations. I shall sacrifice a hundred bulls to honor your triumph.
Save the bulls. Honor Maximus. He won the battle.
If you're very good, tomorrow night I'll tell you the story of emperor Claudius who was betrayed by those closest to him, by his own blood. They whispered in dark corners and went out late at night and conspired and conspired but the emperor Claudius knew they were up to something. He knew they were busy little bees. And one night he sat down with one of them and he looked at her and he said, ""Tell me what you've been doing busy little bee or I shall strike down those dearest to you. You shall watch as I bathe in their blood."" And the emperor was heartbroken. The little bee had wounded him more deeply than anyone else could ever have done. And what do you think happened then, Lucius?
I don't know, uncle.
The little bee told him everything.
Lucius will stay with me now. And if his mother so much as looks at me in a manner that displeases me, he will die. If she decides to be noble and takes her own life, he will die.
And as for you, you will love me as I loved you. You will provide me with an heir of pure blood, so that Commodus and his progeny will rule for a thousand years. Am I not merciful?
AM I NOT MERCIFUL?
What am I going to do with you? You simply won't... die. Are we so different, you and I? You take life when you have to... as I do.
I have only one more life to take. Then it is done.
Then take it now.
They tell me your son...
...squealed like a girl when they nailed him to the cross. And your wife... moaned like a whore when they ravaged her again and again... and again.
The time for honoring yourself will soon be at an end.
Highness.
He sleeps so well because he is loved.
I think I understand my own people.
Then perhaps Caesar will be so good as to teach us, out of his own extensive experience?
I call it love, Gracchus. The people are my children, I am their father. I shall hold them to my bosom and embrace them tightly...
Have you ever embraced someone dying of plague, sire?
No, but if you interrupt me again, I assure you that you will.
Quintus, sword!
Give me your sword!
Sword, give me a sword!
Sheathe your swords! Sheathe your swords!
Your Emperor asks for your loyalty, Maximus. Take my hand, I only offer it once.
And now they love Maximus for his mercy. So I can't just kill him, or it makes me even more unmerciful! The whole thing's like some crazed nightmare.
He is defying you. His every victory is an act of defiance. The mob sees this, and so does the senate. Every day he lives, they grow bolder. Kill him.
No. I will not make a martyr of him.
I have been told of a certain sea snake which has a very unusual method of attracting its prey. It will lie at the bottom of the ocean as if wounded. Then its enemies will approach, and yet it will lie quite still. And then its enemies will take little bites of it, and yet it remains still.
So, we will lie still, and let our enemies come to us and nibble. Have every senator followed.
It vexes me. I'm terribly vexed.
It's a dream, a frightful dream... life is...
But the Senate IS the people, sire. Chosen from AMONG the people. To speak FOR the people.
I doubt if any of the people eat so well as you, Gracchus. Or have such splendid mistresses, Gaius."
Lord Nelson Rathbone,AF,Evil Prince,"Put her down! Put her down!
Or what, Mr. O'Bannon?
Are you gonna kick my ass?
I've read about all your ridiculous exploits. I mean, just, how does it feel to kill a mummy with your bare hands? Only a nation of uneducated rednecks would be amused by such cowboy drivel.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy. What's with the personal attacks? You don't see me making any comments about your pasty complexion or your snotty accent, or even your filthy, smutty sex books! Yeah, I saw your book. It disgusted me...
AH! Why is it always the head with you people?
Perhaps you could explain to me how Looney Lin managed to escape from the confines of Scotland Yard under the watch of the most respected police force in the world.
Yes, of course, it's absolutely fascinating. She picked the lock using a deck of rather risqué playing cards. Then scaled the walls with a mop, a fork, and various pilfered undergarments. I've got to hand it to the Chinese, they're awfully ingenious, Lord, aren't they?
Does your incompetence know no bounds?
Must you keep doing that?
I was told that I should never be seen or heard.
I'm guessing by your hasty retreat, that you're still 20th in line for the throne.
10th!
One more.
Well, what's in it for you?
Your looking at the future king of England.
You're, like, 20th line to the throne.
10th. But my friend here is about to change all that."
Prince Nuada,AF,Evil Prince,"We die and the world will be poorer for it.
You may have mused in the past, am I mortal?
Now you are.
Let this remind you why you once feared the dark...
Kill them.
He lied to us.
Abe, old buddy. We ever get outta this, we gotta talk.
Demon! What are you waiting for? This is what you want, isn't it? Look at it. The last of its kind. Like you and I. If you destroy it, the world will never see its kind again... You have more in common with us than with them. You could be a king... If you cannot command, than you must obey.
Kill me. You must. For I will not stop. I cannot.
Sorry, pal. I win, you live.
Your weapon?
Five-fingered Mary.
The humans... the humans have forgotten the gods, destroyed the earth, and for what? Parking lots? Shopping malls? Greed had burned a hole in their hearts that will never be filled! They will never have enough!
What humans do is in their nature. To honor the truce is in ours.
Honor? Look at this place! Where is the honor in this? Father, you were once a proud warrior. When did you become their pet?
I have returned from exile to wage war and reclaim our land, our birthright! And for that I will call upon the help of all my people and they will answer. The good, the bad...
... and the worst.
The Golden Army? You cannot be that mad!
Perhaps I am. Perhaps they made me so.
Sit *down*, proud, empty, hollow things that you are! Let this remind you why you once feared the dark.
To wage his war, my brother needs this.
The final piece of the crown of BethMora and this map to the location of the Golden Army chamber.
The Golden Army. The harbingers of death, the unstoppable tide...
Howdy Doody.
Your Highness, if you hand the crown piece over to us...
No. Where it goes, I go. My father died to uphold the truce with your world. We must honor his noble intentions.
The lady is in dire danger.
I take is your are vouching for her, Agent Sapien?
Most emphatically, yes.
Even so... I am sorry, but we simply cannot assume such responsibility on our own.
Lady just lost her father, what more do you want?
You may not care, but there are procedures, rules, and little handbooks that...
She's coming with us. You got that, gasbag?
What-what did you call me?
You! You will pay for what happened to my friend down there.
Yeah, right. You take checks?
Demon. Born from a womb of shadows, sent to destroy their world and you still believe you belong?
Are we going to talk all night? Because I'm really sleepy.
How long have you been there, my friend?
They're over there. I bought them today. I haven't fed them, at all. I will go up first, you will follow. And remember Mr. Wink, don't be shy.
Very creative of you. The parchment was of no importance. The cylinder... is very interesting
We will find the Golden Army here. As for the crown piece, I know it's here.I can feel that much in you. Father always tried so hard to shield your heart from mine.
It's in one of the books and I will find it.
Blue? You always look so beautiful in blue. Blue, poetry, love, and lust. Only words. I will find it.

This is outrageous! Please, take whatever you want, but leave us alone! Sir, I demand-!
Be quiet."
Nizam,AF,Evil Prince,"You murdered your family. Sharaman was your brother.
And my curse.
He plunges into a hundred foes without thought, but before marriage he stands frozen with fear! And there are those who say he is not yet wise!
I need a drink.
Out of my way!
Father.
Oh God, help us! The robe, it's poisoned!
Somebody help him.
The robe Dastan gave him!
Why?
*Somebody help him*!
Seize the murderer!
*Somebody help him*!
Nizam! Don't use the dagger to undo your past! It will unleash...!
...unleash what? God's wrath? Hell itself?
You've eased Father's anger, Uncle.
One day, you'll have the pleasure of being brother to the king, Dastan. As long as you remember your most important duty, you should do well.
Oh, and what's that?
Making sure his wine glass stays full.
In a trance we can find anything, including your nephew, Prince Dastan.
Then I hope you shall see more death. Soon.
He's here... Seal every gate. Find him!
What a glorious mess we are.
Enjoy the gutter, Dastan. It's where you'll stay under my reign.
Poor Tus. So eager for the crown.
And you, Dastan, always charging in, so desperate to prove you're more than something the king scraped off the streets.
My death would weaken your young reign.
Our orders were to subdue Koshkahn, not to attack Alamut.
Wise words, little brother.
Words won't stop our enemies, once they're armed with Alamutian blades."
Prince Otwani,AF,Evil Prince,"I am not a foolish young girl. The Shaman taught me that brave tales do not always have happy endings. I know what guns can do. I know that you and I may not live to see another sunset.
Mmmmm!
You are an enemy!
I'm what?
The Shaman taught me- an enemy is someone who takes without asking!
I'll ask then. May I?
Yes! You will be welcome in Zukuru! The head man's locust bean cakes- they will be your locust bean cakes! His fermented buffalo milk will be your fermented buffalo milk!"
Prince Humperdinck,AF,Evil Prince,"First things first, to the death.
No. To the pain.
I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
I'll explain and I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you warthog faced buffoon.
That may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me.
It won't be the last. To the pain means the first thing you will lose will be your feet below the ankles. Then your hands at the wrists. Next your nose.
And then my tongue I suppose, I killed you too quickly the last time. A mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight.
I wasn't finished. The next thing you will lose will be your left eye followed by your right.
And then my ears, I understand let's get on with it.
WRONG. Your ears you keep and I'll tell you why. So that every shriek of every child at seeing your hideousness will be yours to cherish. Every babe that weeps at your approach, every woman who cries out, ""Dear God! What is that thing,"" will echo in your perfect ears. That is what ""to the pain means."" It means I leave you in anguish, wallowing in freakish misery forever.
I think you're bluffing.
It's possible, Pig, I might be bluffing. It's conceivable, you miserable, vomitous mass, that I'm only lying here because I lack the strength to stand. But, then again... perhaps I have the strength after all.
DROP... YOUR... SWORD!

Surrender.
You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.
Mawage. Mawage is wot bwings us togeder today. Mawage, that bwessed awangment, that dweam wifin a dweam...
And wuv, tru wuv, will fowow you foweva...
So tweasure your wuv.
Skip to the end.
Have you the wing?
...and do you, Pwincess Buwwercup...
Man and wife. Say man and wife.
Man an' wife.
For the last time, surrender!
DEATH FIRST!
Your princess is quite a winning creature. A trifle simple, perhaps. Her appeal is undeniable.
I know, the people are quite taken with her. It's odd, but when I hired Vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day, I thought that was clever. But it's going to be so much more moving when I strangle her on our wedding night. Once Guilder is blamed, the nation will truly be outraged - they'll demand we go to war.
Now where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find...
Ah. Are you coming down into the pit? Wesley's got his strength back. I'm starting him on the machine tonight.
Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work, but I've got my country's 500th anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, my wife to murder and Guilder to frame for it; I'm swamped.
Get some rest. If you haven't got your health, then you haven't got anything.
You truly love each other and so you might have been truly happy. Not one couple in a century has that chance, no matter what the story books say. And so I think no man in a century will suffer as greatly as you will.
She is alive, or was an hour ago. If she is otherwise when I find her I shall be very put out.
You truly love each other? Then you might have been truly happy! No couple in a century has that chance, no matter what the storybooks say. And so I think no man in a century will suffer as greatly as you will
Not to Fifty!

Fezzik, do you hear that? That is the sound of ultimate suffering. My heart made that sound when Count Rugen killed my father. The Man in Black makes it now.
The Man in Black?
His true love is marry Prince Humperdinck tonight, so who else has cause for ultimate suffering?
Please consider me as an alternative to suicide.
""My people! A month from now... I've forgotten my line!""
Never happened.
It did! This old man said ""Man and Wife""
Did you say ""I do""
No, we sort of skipped that part.
Then you're not married. If you didn't say it, you didn't do it. Wouldn't you agree, your Highness?
A technicality that will shortly be remedied.
My father's final words were...
Hold it! Hold it, Grandpa!"
Danielle Foussard,P,Classy Cat Burglar,"Danielle, you are just a girl. She is a woman.
Why buy an old car if you can get a new one cheaper? It will run better and last longer.
Say something nice to her, Danielle.
She looks a lot older up close.
To a mere child, anything over twenty might seem old.
A child? Shall we stand in shallower water and discuss that?
I only regret one thing.
That you never asked me to marry you?
No, that I ever took the time to teach you English.
Danielle, do me a favor. Don't call me a cat.
I only do one favor a day.

Will you do as your father here asks?
Did I brush your fur the wrong way?
Well, we only met a couple of minutes ago.
That's right, only a few minutes ago.
Only a few minutes ago? And you talk like old friends...
Ah, well, that's warm, friendly France for you.
I heard some talk in the kitchen. They say, ""What a pity if they must kill The Cat!"""
Julian Noble,AQ,Hitman With A Heart,"The margaritas always taste better in Mexico.
They certainly do.
Margaritas and cock.
I hate these Catholic countries. It's all blushy-blushy and no sucky-fucky.
I'm as serious as an erection problem.
Sorry about the cock thing, it's kind of a conversation stopper.
That door over there, if it weren't locked.
A Vietnamese girl I once knew had her legs so locked together I couldn't get a whiff of her spring roll. Two drinks, half a quaalude later, I was at an all you can eat buffet. Every lock can be broken. It's just a matter of will and whether it's worth it.
Now, escape routes.
Escape routes?
Well you don't want to get caught right?
Oh, right.
Don't get caught. It sucks.
Come on! It'll be a good time!
Oh, so now killing people is a good time?
...Can be.
I'm a big fan of 'the gotta pee' theory of assassination.
I look like a Bangkok hooker on a Sunday morning, after the navy's left town.
I wouldn't do that for all the teenage twat in Thailand.
Just consider me the best cocktail party story you ever met.
I need a break. There's no retirement home for assassins is there? Archery at four. Riflery at five.
Yeah, whatever, goodbye, scoodoodle!
See you, would'nt wanna be you.
Smell ya, shouldn't have to tell ya.
Danny, Danny! Danny with the large white fanny!
Mr. Noble, how are you today?
More importantly, how are you...
...Genevive?
An assassin without confidence is a horrible thing to behold. It's like a relief pitcher who fumbles the ball.
Please tell me you know you mixed two sports in a metaphor.
Huh? Yeah, I can't do that.
I want to retire to a beautiful little Greek island, filled with beautiful little Greeks!
I'd only be interested in your mother if she lost 20 pounds and 30 years.
My handler, Mr. Randy, contacted me the way he always does, through an ad in the International Tribune looking for cat sitters in Bali.
I lie when I need to, tell the truth when I can.
Did You bring your gun?
Yes, as a matter of fact.
May I see it?
Really?
Yes, please.
Did you study the assignment?
No, I shredded it. Then I humped the bellboy on the room service cart.
I didn't mean to weird you out. I was wrong, please. I just get paranoid sometimes. I'm drunk. I'm tired, and I've just been fornicating for the past two hours, and before that I was doing shit - horrible business shit.
I'm the relief pitcher in the bottom of the ninth... and I've fumbled the ball.
How you here for business or pleasure, sir?
My business is my pleasure.
Goddamn it, Julian, you leave the game, even for a while, I don't know if they'll gonna let you back in. And then what the hell are you gonna do? Waste your days picking up illiterate teenagers for suck-and-fuck sessions behind the Old Navy store?
Sounds delightful to me."
Jimmy 'The Tulip' Tudeski,AQ,Hitman With A Heart,"You're a dentist?
Afraid so.
You suicidal?
Why would you say that?
Well, I read that dentists are prone to suicide.
Look, Jimmy, I may hate my life, but I certainly don't want to die."
Mr. Goodkat,AQ,Hitman With A Heart,"Charlie Chaplin once entered a Charlie Chaplin look-alike contest in Monte Carlo and came in third; that's a story.
The reason I'm in town, in case you're wondering, is because of a Kansas City Shuffle.
What's a Kansas City Shuffle?
A Kansas City Shuffle is when everybody looks right, you go left.
Never heard of it.
It's not something people hear about. Falls on deaf ears mostly. This particular one has been over twenty years in the making.
Twenty years, huh?
No small matter. Requires a lot of planning. Involves a lot of people. People connected only by the slightest of events. Like whispers in the night, in that place that never forgets, even when those people do. It starts with a horse.
I want to go home.
Neither of us is going home for a long time, kid.
My name is Goodkat. You can call me Mr. Goodkat.
There was a time.
4:35.
You misunderstood. I wasn't asking for the time, I was just saying... there was a time.
There was a time?
Mmm-hmm. Take Brown Sugar back there, for example. She's pretty fuckin' foxy, right?
She's 70.
If she's a day. But there was a time.
How did you find out about us?
I'm a world-class assassin, fuckhead. How do you think I found out?
At least that's how it went with old Max, who wasn't so much old as he was tired, tired of being a dog without a day. Tired of waking up and finding his dreams were only dreams, but mostly, Max was tired of not having a front lawn.
I'm gonna kill somebody!
That's all there is to it.
Is that all there is to it?
Yup... That's all there is to it.
Fuck. Shit. Jesus.
'Fuck, Shit, Jesus' is right."
John Lee,AQ,Hitman With A Heart,"The boy will die.
Not in your lifetime.
I'll need guns.
You're safer with me.
Is it my perfume or something? Because you are the second guy today to assume I need, want or will accept help. I won't.
It's not an option.
And what happens when I tell you to go fuck yourself?
O.K. If that's the way you want to play it. But when the gun is in my hand, we're gonna have this conversation again.
You know, you could've saved yourself a lot of trouble just by doing that third job.
It was wrong. Mr. Wei was taking revenge. A man named Zedkov killed his son.
Zedkov? Jesus Christ. You're getting yourself killed for a cop?
Not a cop. His son.
What?
A seven-year-old boy.
Why?
That's how Mr. Wei *deals* with his enemies. Through their families.
It will be the last death I cause.
My father taught me how to shoot.
Playing catch is so impersonal.
Now what the fuck did you get me into with Terence Wei?
He's my patron.
Patron?
He made it possible for me to come here.
What does he, sponsor you to play the violin?
...in exchange for... services.
What a nice way of saying you kill people."
Il Duce,AQ,Hitman With A Heart,"Now you will receive us.
We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
We do not want your tired and sick.
It is your corrupt we claim.
It is your evil that will be sought by us.
With every breath, we shall hunt them down.
Each day, we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
Do not kill. Do not rape. Do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.
These are not polite suggestions. These are codes of behavior, and those of you that ignore them will pay the dearest cost.
There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption, into our domain.
For if you do, one day you will look behind you and you will see we three. And on that day, you will reap it.
And we will send you to whatever god you wish.

When I raise my flashing sword, and my hand takes hold on judgment, I will take vengeance upon mine enemies, and I will repay those who hate me. Oh, Lord, raise me to Thy right hand and count me among Thy saints.
How far are we gonna take this, Da?
The question is not how far. The question is, do you possess the constitution, the depth of faith, to go as far is as needed?
Whosoever shed man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed. For in the image of God made He man.
And I shall count thee among my favored sheep, and you shall have the protection of all the Angels in Heaven.

Shut your fucking mouth!
You must watch dear. It'll all be over soon.
You must watch, dear. It'll all be over soon."
Jason Bourne,AQ,Hitman With A Heart,"Thanks for the ride.
Any time.
Well, you can come up, and you can... or you could wait here. I - I can go check it out, but you could wait...
Uh, no, no...
You could wait...
...no, no!
Um, with you, you would probably just forget about me if I... stayed... here.
How could I forget about you?
You're the only person I know.
Who has a safety deposit box full of money and six passports and a gun? Who has a bank account number in their hip? I come in here, and the first thing I'm doing is I'm catching the sightlines and looking for an exit.
I see the exit sign, too. I'm not worried. I mean, you were shot. People do all kinds of weird and amazing stuff when they are scared.
I can tell you the license plate numbers of all six cars outside. I can tell you that our waitress is left-handed and the guy sitting up at the counter weighs two hundred fifteen pounds and knows how to handle himself. I know the best place to look for a gun is the cab or the gray truck outside, and at this altitude, I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking. Now why would I know that? How can I know that and not know who I am?
Do you have ID?
Not really.
What happened?
Nothing.
Did something go wrong?
I've got the records. This guy at the front desk was smiling at me, so I thought, all this trouble, maybe it's easier to just ask for them.
You have the bill?
He made me a photocopy.
You just asked for it?
I said I was Mr. Kane's personal assistant.
Oh. Okay. Good thinking.
Let's ask Marie what she wants to do.
Actually, I don't think she gives a shit. She's dead.
I'm sorry to hear that. How did that happen?
She was slowing me down.
Who am I?
You're U.S. Government property. You're a malfunctioning $30 million weapon. You're a total goddamn catastrophe, and by God, if it kills me, you're going to tell me how this happened.
I don't want to do this anymore.
I don't think that's a decision you can make.
Jason Bourne is dead, you hear me? He drowned two weeks ago. You're gonna go tell 'em that Jason Bourne is dead, you understand?
Where are you gonna go?
I swear to God, if I even feel somebody behind me, there is no measure to how fast and how hard I will bring this fight to your doorstep. I'm on my own side now.
So...
What?
...we got a bump coming up.
You sent me to kill Wombosi.
Kill Wombosi? We can do that any time we want. I can send Nikki to do that, for Chrissakes. Mr. Wombosi was supposed to be dead three weeks ago. He was supposed to have died in a way where the only possible explanation was that he'd been murdered by a member of his own entourage. I don't send you to kill. I send you to be invisible. I send you because you don't exist.
Vertel me wie ik ben. (Tell me who I am.)
Look, I'm... you're acting like I'm trying to burn you here. I'm just trying to do the right thing.
Nobody does the right thing.
Who are you? Are you Treadstone?
Am I Treadstone? Me? What the hell are you talking about?
He's lost it!
You move, you die.
Bourne.
Gun down.
I told you to come alone, but I guess that was too hard. So try this - I'm gone.
What are you looking at?
I heard you inside.
What?
The consulate. I heard you talking? I thought maybe we could help each other.
How's that?
You need money. I need a ride outta here.
I'm not running a car service just now, thank you.
I'll give you ten thousand dollars for driving me to Paris.
What, do you think I am, a fool?
You'd be a fool not to take it.
What is this, a joke? Some kind of scam?
No, it's no scam.
And I'll give you another ten when we get there.
Jesus.
Is that for you?
Look. You drive, I pay, it's that simple.
Scheisse. I got enough trouble, okay?
Okay. Can I have my money back?
I don't wanna know who I am any more.
Shh.
I don't care. I don't wanna know.
Come on, we'll...
Everything I found out, I wanna forget.
It's okay.
I don't care who I am or what I did.
It's okay.
We have this money. We can hide. Could we do that? Is there any chance you can do that?
I don't know. Come on.
Whatever we do, we have to do it together. We have to be...
We? The only thing we had in common was that neither one of us knew who you were! We are past that now.
Marie! Listen to me! The police will find us, and the people who took that picture in the Embassy, the people who killed Wombosi, they are going to come here and they are gonna kill us.
The people you work for!
I will take you wherever you need to go. I will take you there; I will leave you there. You can do whatever you want, you never have to see me again. But not here. If we stay here, we die.
...it was amazing. It was just amazing for about three months, until it turned out that this uh, jerk, who had fronted us the lease was actually shining everyone on and...
And what?
What do you mean, what? Listen to me; I, I've been speed talking for about sixty kilometers now. I, I talk when I'm nervous, I mean, I, I talk like this when I'm nervous. I'm gonna shut up now.
What's this? You tie these knots? So it starts to come back, huh?
No, it doesn't start to come back. The knot's like everything else, I just found the rope and I did it. The same way I can, I can read, I can write. I can add, subtract. I can make coffee. I can shuffle cards. I can set up a chessboard."
Frank Falenczyk,AQ,Hitman With A Heart,"It isn't that I'm sorry I killed them; it's that I'm sorry I killed them badly.
Here's to granting others the serenity to change the things you cannot accept.
And the courage to accept large amounts of change serenely.
And the wisdom to know the difference.
You gonna run and tell mommy?
That's right, Frank. I'm going to run and tell mommy.
Shit.
Does that mean you're my sponsor?
Does that mean you're asking?
Is this the part where we kiss?
Actually, it went better than you think. It did
How do you know they won't tell the police?
It's Alcoholics Anonymous.
Somehow I don't really feel that's what they had in mind when they came up with the name, but you never know.
What are you thinking about, sitting there all serious?
My shortcomings.
Women don't even pay attention to that.
I missed dinner last night because I got drunk with little Irish people.
I was thinking he kind of looked like a prick, if you don't mind me saying.
No, no, not at all.
Also, he seems to have enormous feet.
Yeah, well, those aren't his shoes. I couldn't find his. Stole those from the Chestnut Lanes. Don't tell my Mom.
Might have to break his toes.
Whatever gets the job done.
You'd refuse a dying man his last request?
Sorry, you dying?
For fuck's sake, I'm talking about Patrick. That's what this party's all about, sending him on his way.
Thank you, really, I can't. I'm working, I... gotta keep an eye on things.
He's not going anywhere.
Are you pregnant?
No! Unless you put something in my egg-roll. And then put the egg-roll in my...
No, no, you're not suppose to eat those, they're just for show, 'kay?
Oh.
I'm kidding. I'm Tom.

Hi. This your first time?
I've had cookies before."
Wesley Gibson,AQ,Hitman With A Heart,"Shut the fuck up!
She has one single iota of tenuous power. She thinks she can push everyone around.
You don't need this.
I understand. Junior high must've been kind of tough, but it doesn't give you the right to treat your workers like horseshit, Janice. I know we laugh at you, Janice. We all know you keep a stash of jelly donuts in the top drawer of your desk.
But I want you to know, if you weren't such a bitch, we'd feel sorry for you. I do feel sorry for you. But as it stands, the way you behave - I feel I can speak for the entire office when I tell you... go fuck yourself.
Six weeks ago I was ordinary and pathetic. Just like you. Who am I now? An account manager, an assassin, just another tool that was mind fucked into killing his father. I'm all of these, and I'm none of these. Who am I now? This is not me fulfilling my destiny. This is not me falling in my fathers footsteps. This is definitely not me saving the world.
Still trying to figure out how you are?
This is not me. This is just a motherfucking decoy.
Oh fuck.
This is me taking control from Sloane, from the fraternity, from Janice from billing reports, from ergonomic keyboards, from cheating girlfriends and sack a shit best friends. This is me taking back control of my life. What the fuck have you done lately?
What the fuck have you done lately?
It's my anorexic boss' birthday. This means there's a certain amount of inter-office pressure to stand around the conference table, eating crappy food and pretending to worship her. Acting for five minutes like Janice doesn't make all our lives miserable is the hardest work I'll do all day. My job title is account manager. I used to be called an account service representative, but a consultant told us we have to manage our clients, and to not service them. I have a girlfriend who I neither manage or service. That's my best friend Barry fucking her on an Ikea kitchen table I picked up for a really good price. I'm finding it hard to care about anything these days. In fact, the only thing I do care about is the fact that I can't care about anything. Seriously, it worries me. My name is Wesley Gibson. My dad walked out on my mom when I was seven days old. Sometimes I wonder if he ever looked into my baby blue eyes and asked himself ""did I just father the most insignificant asshole of the twenty-first century""?
What did he do to deserve to die? You don't know. I didn't know if he was bad. I didn't know if he was evil. I didn't know anything about him. We get orders from a loom; fate. And we're supposed to take enough faith in what we're doing is right. Killing someone we know nothing about. I don't know if I can do that.
About twenty years ago, there was this girl. Her dad was a federal judge, so she probably had it in her mind that she would follow in his footsteps. So she's home one Christmas, and her dad's on this big racketeering case. The defendant wanted to get a softer judge who they could buy off. So they hired this guy, Max Petridge, to get him to pay her father a visit. And the way he pays people a visit is to break in, and tie up their loved ones, and force them to watch while he burns his targets alive. And then he takes a wire hanger, twists it around, and brands his initials into each one of them so they will never ever forget. After I was recruited into the Fraternity, I found out that Max Petridge's name had come up, weeks before the federal judge was killed, and that a Fraternity member had failed to pull the trigger. We don't know how far the ripples of our decisions go. We kill one, and maybe save a thousand. That's the code of the Fraternity. That's what we believe in, and that's why we do it.
You know when you have a dream and you're half-awake, but still in the fringe of your brain, and when you open your eyes you're so damn glad it was a dream?
This was nothing like that.
Wesley, listen to me...
Shut the fuck up. You don't get to talk to me. You don't get to talk to me!
Everything they told you... was a lie.
Shut up you lying piece of shit. You shut the fuck up.
You're my son.
Want to hear something sad? I use an ergonomic keyboard to keep my repetitive stress injury in check. Just the fact that I repeat something enough that it causes me stress is fucking sad.
You know there are people, beautiful people, you just wish they could see you in a different setting, a different place. Instead of where you are, what you've become. But most of all, you wish you weren't such a pussy, for wishing for things that'll never change.
Who's the man?
I'm the man!
You are a pussy!
I'm not a pussy. I got a healthy respect for the human... condition.
Fuck that! You are a pussy!
I'm sorry!
Please, please, please drive faster!
Please be quiet!
I think we lost him... I think we lost him. Can you let me off at the next corner, please?
Why did you make me do this?
Because you are the only person he wouldn't kill.
What did you say to me? It's a name, it's a target. I don't want this person dead, fate does! Well fate wanted you dead.
You're not an assassin of fate, Sloan. You're just a thug who can bend bullets.
I'm sorry.
You apologize too much.
Well, sorry about that.
I knew your father.
My father left the week I was born, so...
Your father died yesterday on the rooftop of the Metropolitan Building. Sorry.
Look, the liquor aisle is just over there, so if you want to go...
Your father was one of the greatest assassins who ever lived. The man who killed him is behind you.
Do you make sweaters, or do you kill people?
That's not too tight, is it?
No, that's... nice.
Get back in here!
I have a gun, sir!
Do you spend a lot of time with knives?
Breakfast, lunch and dinner.
That was a rhetorical question, puto. You interrupt me again, I use the business end. Here's what you need to know, puto. Knives are easy to hide. They don't jam, and they never run out of bullets. They come in handy when you want to do some close contact work.
Wesley!
What is it?
What do you mean what is it? Listen.
How the hell am I supposed to sleep with all that fucking racket? When are we going to move so that we don't have to wake up to that shit?
I kind of like it.
It helps to drown out the sound of your annoying fucking voice. Now please, let me sleep.
I'm the man? Yeah right, Barry. I'm the man. In fact, I'm so much the man that I have a standing prescription for medication to control my anxiety attacks. God, I wish I had something else to relieve my stress.
This is the Recovery Room. This bath stimulates white blood cells and speeds up the process. If you have bruises, cuts, breaks - heal in hours, not days.

Is that vodka?
Yeah.
Are you Russian?
Yeah.
Oh my God! Hey, we can't shoot a dead woman! She might be somebody's mom!
You need to know what it's like to put a bullet in a body.
I want you to curve the bullet.
How am I supposed to do that?
It's not a question of how. It's a question of what. If no one told you that bullets flew straight, and I gave you a gun and told you to hit the target, what would you do? Let your instincts guide you.
He's fucking persistent, you know?
You know, if I wanted to get beat up, I would've stayed in my cubicle!
Why are you here?
I don't know who I am!
What did you say?
I said I don't know who I am.
Have you ever thought about doing things differently?
How do you mean?
I don't know. Being somebody else? Someone... normal?
No.
Oh my God! Oh my God! What the fuck just happened?
I'm gonna go get some Post-It notes, do you want one?
No.
Really?
Yeah.
I'm the Repairman.
What do you repair?
A lifetime of bad habits.
Are we gonna ""bond,"" now?
Would you like to?
Shoot the wings off the flies.
I don't... I don't know what that means.
Shoot the wings off the flies.
I really think you have me mixed up with somebody else.
On three, either you shoot or I do.
So, bending bullets. Can you do that? You do that... hello?
I'm sorry!"
Vincent,AQ,Hitman With A Heart,"Max, six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape cause of one fat guy.
Well, who was he?
What do you care? Have you ever heard of Rwanda?
Yes, I know Rwanda.
Well, tens of thousands killed before sundown. Nobody's killed people that fast since Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Did you bat an eye, Max?
What?
Did you join Amnesty International, Oxfam, Save the Whales, Greenpeace, or something? No. I off one fat Angelino and you throw a hissy fit.
Man, I don't know any Rwandans.
You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.
Look in the mirror. Paper towels, clean cab. Limo company some day. How much you got saved?
That ain't any of your business.
Someday? Someday my dream will come? One night you will wake up and discover it never happened. It's all turned around on you. It never will. Suddenly you are old. Didn't happen, and it never will, because you were never going to do it anyway. You'll push it into memory and then zone out in your barco lounger, being hypnotized by daytime TV for the rest of your life. Don't you talk to me about murder. All it ever took was a down payment on a Lincoln town car. That girl,you can't even call that girl. What the fuck are you still doing driving a cab?
A guy gets on the MTA here L.A. and dies. Think anybody'll notice?
Get with it. Millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars, in a speck on one in a blink. That's us, lost in space. The cop, you, me... Who notices?
Take comfort in knowing you never had a choice.
Okay, look, here's the deal. Man, you were gonna drive me around tonight, never be the wiser, but El Gordo got in front of a window, did his high dive, we're into Plan B. Still breathing? Now we gotta make the best of it, improvise, adapt to the environment, Darwin, shit happens, I Ching, whatever man, we gotta roll with it.
I Ching? What are you talking about, man? You threw a man out of a window.
I didn't throw him. He *fell*
Well what did he do to you?
What?
What did he do to *you*?
Nothing. I only met him tonight.
You just met him once and you killed him like that?
What? I should only kill people after I get to know them?
They project onto you their flaws, what they don't like about themselves. I had a father like that.
Mothers are worse.
Wouldn't know. My mother died before I remember her.
What about your father?
Hated everything I did. Got drunk, beat me up. In and out of foster homes, that kinda thing.
And then?
I killed him. I was twelve.
I'm kidding. He died of liver disease.
Well, I'm sorry.
No, you're not.
I can't drive you around while you're killing folks. It ain't my job!
Tonight it is.
There's no good reason, there's no bad reason to live or to die.
Then what are you?
I'm indifferent.
Lets go.
Hey, why don't you just take the cab?
Take the cab?
Yeah, you take it. I'll - I'll chill. I'll - I'll just chill. They don't even know who's driving these things half the time anyway. They never check or anything. Okay... so... just - just take it. You, me...
You promise not to tell anybody right?
Yeah... yeah... yeah... promise.
Get in the fucking car.
Hey.
He, he, he fell on the cab. He fell, he fell from up there on the motherfucking cab. Shit. I think he's dead.
Good guess.
You killed him?
No, I shot him. Bullets and the fall killed him.
Yo, homey! That my briefcase?
First time in L.A.?
No. Tell you the truth, whenever I'm here I can't wait to leave. It's too sprawled out, disconnected. You know? That's me. You like it?
It's my home.
17 million people. This was a country, it'd be the fifth biggest economy in the world and nobody knows each other. I read about this guy, gets on the MTA here, dies.
Oh.
Six hours he's riding the subway before anybody notices his corpse doing laps around L.A., people on and off sitting next to him. Nobody notices.
Most people - same job, same gig, doing the same thing 10 years from now. Us, we don't know what we are doing 10 minutes from now.
Well, that was brilliant...
Max, I do this for a living!
You're full of shit.
I'm full of shit? You're a monument of it. You even bullshitted yourself, all I am is taking out the garbage, killing bad people.
Yeah, well that's what you said.
You believed me?
Then what'd they do?
How do I know, you know? They all got that 'witness for the prosecution' look to me. Probably some major federal indictment of somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted.
Hey! Flowers?
It's a waste of money. Won't mean a thing to her.
She carried you in her womb for nine months. People buy flowers. Buy flowers.
Someday my dream will come. One night you'll wake up and you'll discover it never happened. It's all turned around on you and it never will. Suddenly you are old, didn't happened and it never will, 'cause you were never going to do it anyway.
You're alive. I saved you. Do I get any thanks? No. All you can do is clam up. You wanna talk? Tell me to fuck off?
Fuck off.
I'm not taking you to see my mother.
Since when was any of this negotiable?
Yeah, Lenny, what's up? It's me.
Just got off the phone with the cops. Desk sergeant called to check if you brought the cab in?
Yeah, so?
So, aside from I hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the goddamn cab?
No, no, I got crashed into. I didn't...
Do I care what, where, why? You're paying.
It was an accident. You're not liable.
It was an accident. I'm not liable.
Bullshit. I'm making you liable. It's coming out of your goddamn pocket.
You tell him to stick this cab up his fat ass.
I can't do that, that's my boss.
So?
I need my job.
No, you don't.
You attract attention, you're going to get people killed who didn't need to be.
Why didn't you just kill me and get another cab driver?
Cause you're good. We're in this together. Fates intertwined. Cosmic Coincidence.
Just when I thought you were a cool guy.
I am a cool guy, with a job I contracted to do.
If you open that trunk, they go inside.
Only thing that didn't show up is the Polish cavalry.
How long have you been doing this? In case anyone asks?
Private sector? Six years.
Uh... you get health benefits? Pension...?
No, and no paid vacation. Quit stalling, and get in there.
Still there? I'm talking to you. Max. Max!
He's not paying you a damn thing.
Who the hell is this?
Albert Ricardo, Assistant U.S. Attorney, a passenger in this cab, and I'm reporting you to the D.M.V.
Let's not, oh, let's not get excited.
Not get excited? How am I supposed to not get excited? Listen, you try to extort a working man. You know goddamn well your collision policy and general liability umbrella will cover the damages. And what are you trying to pull, you sarcastic prick?
Look, I was just trying to...
Tell it to him.
Tell him he's an asshole. Go ahead.
You're an asshole.
Tell him he pulls this shit again, you're gonna stick this yellow cab up his fat ass.
And, and next time you pull any shit, I'm gonna... I'm gonna have to stick this yellow cab up... up your fat ass.
Limos, huh?
Don't start.
Hey, I'm not the one lying to my mother.
She hears what she wants to hear. I don't disillusion her.
Yeah, right. Maybe she hears what you tell her.
Whatever I tell her is never good enough anyway. It's always been that way. So whats at El Rodeo?
Just drive.
They project onto you their flaws. What they don't like about themselves, their lives, whatever. They rank on you instead.
How do you know?""
Lady Macbeth. Leave the seats. The light's green. We're sitting here.
Asshole!
You no longer have the cleanest cab in La-La Land. You gotta live with that. Focus on the job. Drive.
Don't get me cornered. You don't have the trunk space.
You got ten minutes. 10:01? I drive the cab to the hospital and execute your mother on my way out of town, and don't pretend indifference.
I can't do this.
What's your name?
Max.
Max. I'm Vincent.
You OK?
Yeah, I'm fine mate, don't worry about it.
Of all the cabbies in L.A. I get Max, Sigmund Freud meets Dr. Ruth.
What's with you, man?
As in?
As in, if somebody had a gun to your head and said, ""You gotta tell me what's going on with this person over here or I'm gonna kill you. What is driving him? What is he thinking?"" You know, you couldn't do it, could you? Because they would have to kill your ass because you don't know what anyone else is thinking. I think you're low, my brother. Way low.
Give me your wallet. Come on.
Give you my wallet. For what?
I'll hold it for you in case the people inside search you.
Who's searching?
The people inside. Go in, ask for Felix. He's expecting you.
Felix?
Yeah.
What does he look like?
I don't know. I've never met him.
Who is he?
He's connected to the guys who hired me.
I don't get it.
You destroyed my workups. Number Four is due. What'd you think? The night's over? Called on account of rain? You go in there. Say you're me. Score the backups. They'll be on flash drive or CD.
Me? How come you don't go?
I don't meet people. Risk management. Anonymity. I protect mine. You're not gonna' screw that up. I got a contract with they're bosses. These guys don't get to meet me. They don't know what I look like.
If I don't pull it off, then...
They will kill you. Now, you've got ten minutes. At 10:01 I drive to the hospital and execute your mother on my way out of town. And don't pretend indifference.
I can't do this. I can't.
What are you talking about? Sure you can, man. Come on. Hey! Hey!
Look, man. If I do this, I'm just gonna end up getting other people killed.
Out of options, Max. Just take comfort in knowing you never had a choice.
How long have you been doing this?
Why?
Just in case they ask.
Private sector, six years.
Red light, Max.
Let her go.
Max? Why? What are you gonna do about it?
Okay. All right. Six years. You get benefits? Or, you know, like insurance? Pension?
No, no paid sick leave. Quit stalling. Get out of the cab."
Professor Philip Brainard,A,Absent Minded Professor,"Ta-ta, my love.
Are you nuts?
I'll be right back!
Ouch.
Phillip, are you hurt?
Just my pride.
What happened between us, Phil?
Well, I just got tired of you stealing my ideas, Wilson.
I'm not an innovator like you, Phil. I'm an adapter, and to that end, I have profited from your ideas.
Why are you here?
Well, to be honest. I'm here this weekend to steal your fiancee. And make her my wife.
Well, I think you'll be sadly disappointed.
I was just gonna, you know, grade my lunch, eat a few tests and hope for the best.
How do you hold it in?
Well, like everybody else, Ruthie. I just cross my legs real tight.
I was talking about your excitement.
Maybe you should just go without me.
Why?
Because I get car sick.
Oh, come on. You're not gonna blow chips.
No!
You don't have a stomach.
I have a queasy gyro."

Useless garbage is broken down into its basic molecular components, which are then recombined to form a whole range of useful new products, from bedpans to bowling balls! Hey, need a new bedpan? I know I do!
It's quick, it's easy, and in no time at all... you've taken 50 lbs of yesterday's garbage and transformed it into a beautiful new bed... bowling ball!"
Dr. Reinhardt Lane,A,Absent Minded Professor,"Oh what the heck, it's always green.
NO!
That is red! THIS is green!"
Dr. Harold Medford,A,Absent Minded Professor,"Pat, if these monsters got started as a result of the first atomic bomb in 1945, what about all the others that have been exploded since then?
I don't know.
Nobody knows, Robert. When Man entered the atomic age, he opened a door into a new world. What we'll eventually find in that new world, nobody can predict.
We may be witnesses to a Biblical prophecy come true - 'And there shall be destruction and darkness come upon creation, and the beasts shall reign over the earth.'
None of the ants previously seen by man were more than an inch in length - most considerably under that size. But even the most minute of them have an instinct and talent for industry, social organization, and savagery that makes man look feeble by comparison.
And I thought today was the end of them.
No. We haven't seen the end of them. We've only had a close view of the beginning of what may be the end of us.
Search Able to Search Baker.
Say ""Over.""
Huh?
Then say ""Over.""
""Over?""
Medford in Baker to Medford in Able: Go ahead, Dad. Over.
Have you found anything yet?
Say ""Over.""
I just said it.
I know. Say it again.
Oh. ""Over!""
Baker to Able: Not yet. We're about three quarters of the way across our sector. We're now at coordinates Charlie-Six. Over.
Well, don't pass up any possibilities. Let me know the moment you find ANYTHING.
If you're finished, say ""Over and out.""
But she KNOWS I'm through talking with her.
I know she does, Doctor. It's a rule, though. You gotta say it.
Ah...
Isn't that right, General?
Right, Sergeant.
This is ridiculous! A lot of good your rules are gonna do us if we don't locate the...
Over and out.
Oh, now you're happy.
That, gentlemen, is why you are here - to consider this problem and, I hope, solve it. Because unless you solve it, unless these queens are located and destroyed before they've established thriving colonies and can produce, heaven alone knows, how many more queen ants, man, as the dominant species of life on earth, will probably be extinct within...

Allergies: always happens when I travel.
Jackson.
Those your parents?
Foster parents. What-what's this all about?
A job.
What kind of a job?
Translation: ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs. Interested?
I-I'm gonna go now.
Go where?
I mean, you've just been evicted out of your apartment, your grants have run out: everything you own are in those two bags. You wanna prove that your theories are right? This is your chance.
I can't make it out, sounds familiar. Bit like Berber, maybe Chadic or Omodic.
He's inviting us to go with him.
How can you be so sure?
Because he's
inviting us to go with him.
Colonel! What do you see?
Sandstorm comin' this way.
Well, that would have been an excellent reason to shoot everyone.
I wouldn't feed that thing.
It's got a harness, it's domesticated
I'll be damned.
It was under the cover-stones?
Yes. My father found it, 1928; made out of a mineral unlike any found on Earth.
Your job here is to re-align the star gate. Can you do that or not?
I can't."
Count Dooku,BD,Pupil Turned To Evil,"What if I told you that the Republic was now under the control of a dark lord of the Sith?
No, that's not possible. The Jedi would sense it.
The Dark Side has clouded their vision. Hundreds of senators are now under the influence of a Sith lord called Darth Sidious.
I don't believe you.
Master Kenobi, you disappoint me. Yoda holds you in such high esteem. Surely you can do better!
As you can see, my Jedi powers are far beyond yours. Now, back down.
I don't think so.
You must join me, Obi-Wan, and together we will destroy the Sith!
I will never join you.
That was brave, boy, but foolish. I would have thought you'd have learned your lesson.
I'm a slow learner.
Brave, but, foolish, my old Jedi friend. You are impossibly outnumbered.
I don't think so.
We'll see.
May I ask why a Jedi Knight is all the way out here on Geonosis?
I'm tracking a bounty hunter named Jango Fett. Do you know him?
There are no bounty hunters here that I am aware of. The Geonosians don't trust them.
Master Windu, you have fought gallantly. Worthy of recognition in the archives of the Jedi Order. Now... it is finished.
Powerful you have become Dooku, the dark side I sense in you.
I have become more powerful than any Jedi. Even you.
Much to learn, you still have.
I have good news for you, my lord. War has begun.
Excellent. Everything is going as planned.
It is obvious that this contest cannot be decided by our knowledge of the Force... but by our skills with a lightsaber.
The force is with us, Master Sidious.
Welcome home Lord Tyranus. You have done well.
Geonosians don't trust bounty hunters.
Well, who can blame them?
I will never join you, Dooku.
It may be difficult to secure your release.
Fought well you have, my old Padawan
This is just the beginnig!
You're gonna pay for all the Jedi that you killed today, Dooku.
We'll take him together.
You go slowly while I take him now!
No! Anakin, no! No!
as you see, my Jedi powers are far beyond yours. Now, back up.
I don't think so.
Master Kenobi, you disappoint me. Yoda holds you in such high steam.
Surely you can do better!
Master Windu, how pleasant of you to join us. You're just in time for the moment of truth. I would think these two new boys of yours could use a little more training.
Sorry to disappoint you, Dooku. This party's over.
Brave, but foolish, my old Jedi friend. You're impossibly outnumbered.
I don't think so. The Geonosians aren't warriors. One Jedi has to be worth a hundred Geonosians.
It wasn't the Geonosians I was thinking about. How well do you think one Jedi will hold up against a thousand battle droids?"
Aaron Hallam,BD,Pupil Turned To Evil,"What if there was a species above us in the food chain? How do you think you'd feel if that species lost total respect for us... and started slaughtering us wholesale?
If you cross this line, you better be ready to kill me.
When you kill with your own hands there is a reverence. There's no reverence in what you do.
Your actions resulted in the injuries and death of unarmed civilians.
They had weapons.
Well, that's the problem, you can't tell the sharks from the guppies any more.
They're coming for you.
They've been coming for me for a long time, L.T."
Dreyfus,BN,The Chief,"If I were my father, I'd have you tortured.
No. If you were your father, I doubt very much if I would have kissed you.
If I'm not being too nosy your highness, I read somewhere there was some dispute over the ownership of the Pink Panther.
It belongs to me. It was a gift from my late father. I shall never surrender it.
Why should you?
When the present government seized power, they claimed the diamond was the property of the people. There's even some talk of the international court deciding the issue.
I'll tell you what, why don't I steal the diamond, leave that old glove or whatever it is behind, and you and I can split the insurance.
All right.
I feel like dancing.
Your Highness?
I'd love to.
How about you, Madame?
Yes, of course.
Your leg is better, Sir. Charles?
What?
I say your leg is better.
Oh, yes. Much better. Thank you.
You know, Mr. Tucker...
Argh!
That's my beer, old man.
When I went on my first zsrafari... frazari... wild animal hunt.
I am willing to bet you ten thousand francs, that the phantom is in Cortina at this very moment. Even, perhaps, in this very room.
How exciting. What do you think, Mr. Tucker?
Oh, I agree with the inspector. You see, Ten of his last fifteen victims have been guests at Angela Dunning's parties.
What are we all talking about?
The notorious Phantom.
I'm afraid I never heard of him.
From the little I've read about him, he seems to be quite a fellow.
Believe me. There are few thieves who are as clever as the Phantom. Each theft is completely different and unique, classic in its conception.
I thought you were working on the theory that he does repeat himself.
Well, only as far as Angela Dunning's parties are concerned. However, there is one other duplication, but that is his ah... trademark, his calling card, so to speak. He always leaves a white monogrammed glove.
Sounds terribly theatrical.
Your Highness, if I were the Phantom, I'd have chosen my victim already.
Really? And who would that be?
Well, who owns the most fabulous diamond in the world?
I suppose I do.
Exactly. The Pink Panther. Such a prize he could never resist. He would be bound to try for it.
I'm afraid he'd be disappointed. The Pink Panther is in my safe, at...
Your Highness, please. Don't say it, not here.
I've never really known another man like him. He can keep ten girls in the air at once and make each one happy.
Amazing, sort of a contemporary Don Juan?"
Lt. Andrew Bogomil,BN,The Chief,"Is this the gentleman who crashed through Victor Maitland's window? Who disabled an unmarked unit with a banana?

What, can the guy hear me through the wall?
, :
Yes, he can.
, :
Yes, he can.
Why didn't you identify yourself as a police officer when you were arrested?
'Cause I was mindin' my own business. Hey, where the fuck do you guys get off on arresting somebody for getting thrown out of a window?
We have six witnesses that say you broke in and started tearing up the place, then jumped out the window!
And you guys believe that? What the fuck are you, cops or doormen?
We're more likely to believe an important local businessman than a foul-mouthed jerk from out of town.
Foul-mouthed?
Fuck you, man.
Hey, Sarge...
You watch your mouth.
Hey, man, don't square off on me with some bullshit.
You wanna start some static?
Hey, don't push me!
Fuck you, man!
Taggart!
Yes, sir.
Come here.
Sir... I apologize for striking you. I have no excuse.
Forget about it.
You expect me to believe that report?
That's the report I'm filing, sir.
Is this man?
Yes sir!
Is this the gentleman who crashed through Victor Maitland's window? Who disabled an unmarked unit with a banana?
Yes sir!
Who lured Taggart and Rosemont into a gross dereliction of duty at a striptease establishment?
Ah, it's RoseWOOD, sir!
Yes sir!
Is this the gentleman who ruined the buffet at the Harrow Club this morning?
Yes sir!
I just bet you are the pride of your department in Detroit. Lieutenant, I'd like to see you in your office.
Yes sir!
In Beverly Hills, we go strictly by the book. Now, why didn't you inform us when you came into town?
I'm on vacation.
If you're on vacation, what business did you going into Victor Maitland's office?
Had to go to the bathroom. I was walking by. It looked like a nice clean place, so I stopped.
Do you always take your gun on vacation?
No, well, I never been on vacation before, but, in Detroit, cops are required to carry a gun at all times.
Well, if you want to carry a gun, I suggest you go back there.
Well, I can't wait to go back there.
Is that so? I just got off the phone with Inspector Todd in Detroit. Does that name ring a bell?
He's my boss.
He tells me you may not be very welcomed back there. He also told me you're an outstanding young detective. I find that very hard to believe.
But it's true though.
He also says he nearly had to fire you for insubordination. I find that very easy to believe. Now, what are you doing in Beverly Hills?
I told you I'm on vacation. I went to the bathroom and next thing I know six guys throw out of a window.
Inspector Todd gave me a message for you. Want to hear it?
I don't think so.
He says if you're out here investigating the Tandino murder, you don't even need to bother coming back. He tells me if we inform you are working on this case, he'll have you brought up on charges and fired. Now last time, what are you doing in Beverly Hills?
. I told you I'm on...

VACATION!

VACATION!"

All right. Let's have it.
Have what?
You report. What have you been doing?
Well, for the past three-quarters of an hour, I've been sitting on my ass waiting on you.
Have you been following that man?
Yeah, I've been following him on my own time. And anybody can tell I didn't do that to him.
How?
Cause he looks too damn good, that's how!
Callahan? You willing to take the money to him?
When will you people stop messing around with this guy? He's gotta be stopped now!
He's got a busload of kids and I can't take that chance. I gave my word of honor on it and he will not be molested! That's a direct order, Callahan!

Transportation is a precise business.
I'd like to do some sight-seeing.
This plane isn't for tourists.
I'm not a tourist.
You don't need your mouth to pee.
The delivery will be made. My daughter will get over it. If I'm lucky, she'll see the light.
Yeah, and if she's lucky, maybe you'll get hit by a truck.
All right, that's enough juice for now.
That's your last pee break for this trip.
I'd rather see it coming.
Makes no difference to me.
Like a dogshit... You're everywhere.
I got sick of seeing my best efforts turned into bullshit, by the same people that paid me to do the job!"
Agent Smith,Q,Consummate Professional,"I'd like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here. It came to me when I tried to classify your species and I realized that you're not actually mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment but you humans do not. You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed and the only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet. You're a plague and we are the cure.
Did you know that the first Matrix was designed to be a perfect human world? Where none suffered, where everyone would be happy. It was a disaster. No one would accept the program. Entire crops were lost. Some believed we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world. But I believe that, as a species, human beings define their reality through suffering and misery. The perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from. Which is why the Matrix was redesigned to this: the peak of your civilization.
Never send a human to do a machine's job.
You hear that Mr. Anderson?... That is the sound of inevitability... It is the sound of your death... Goodbye, Mr. Anderson...
My name... is Neo.
We're willing to wipe the slate clean, give you a fresh start. All that we're asking in return is your cooperation in bringing a known terrorist to justice.
Yeah. Well, that sounds like a pretty good deal. But I think I may have a better one. How about, I give you the finger
and you give me my phone call.
It seems that you've been living two lives. One life, you're Thomas A. Anderson, program writer for a respectable software company. You have a social security number, pay your taxes, and you... help your landlady carry out her garbage. The other life is lived in computers, where you go by the hacker alias ""Neo"" and are guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for. One of these lives has a future, and one of them does not.
Yeah. That sounds like a really good deal. But I got a better one. How about... I give you the finger... and you give me my phone call?
Mr. Anderson... you disappoint me.
You can't scare me with this Gestapo crap. I know my rights. I want my phone call.
Tell me, Mr. Anderson... what good is a phone call... if you're unable to speak?
I hate this place. This zoo. This prison. This reality, whatever you want to call it, I can't stand it any longer. It's the smell, if there is such a thing. I feel saturated by it. I can taste your stink and every time I do, I fear that I've somehow been infected by it.
You're empty.
So are you.
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders.
I'm just doing my job. You give me that ""juris-my-dick-tion"" crap... you can cram it up your ass.
I think we can handle one little girl. I sent two units, they're bringing her down now.
No lieutenant, your men are already dead.
The great Morpheus. We meet at last.
And you are?
A Smith. Agent Smith.
You all look the same to me.
As you can see, we've had our eye on you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.
Check him.
He's gone.
Good bye, Mr Anderson.
She got out.
Doesn't matter.
The informant is real.
Yes.
We have the name of their next target.
The name is Neo.
We'll need a search running.
It has already begun.
I'm going to enjoy watching you die, Mr. Anderson.
Find them and destroy them
Dammit.
The trace was completed.
We have their position.
Sentinels are standing by.
Order the strike.
They are not out yet.
Never send a human to do a machine's job.
If, indeed, the insider has failed, they'll sever the connection as soon as possible. Unless...
...they're dead. In either case...
...we have no choice but to continue as planned. Deploy the sentinels. Immediately."
The Professor,Q,Consummate Professional,"Look at this. Look at what they make you give.
I work alone, like you. We always work alone."
Beth,AL,Granola Person,"DAMMIT!
It's not that hard, uhm... when he speaks to you count to three in your head before you answer him.
Don't show any interest. Don't even look at him too much.
Yeah yeah. You got it?
I said you got it?
I was counting to three!
Not that slowly! We don't what him to think you're retarded!
What are you girls doing?
Destroying a man.
Who Do I Make My Check Out to?
Your mom is SO HOT!
So I talked to John. He was sweet. He felt bad for you. He said that you were jealous because we share something special. Something that we don't have to label because...
Because it's our unspoken bond and I just love how secure you are?
And it hurts me to question it, because...
, , :

... YOU'RE THE ONLY GIRL FOR ME?
, , :

... YOU'RE THE ONLY GIRL FOR ME?
, , :

... YOU'RE THE ONLY GIRL FOR ME?
Damn! He said the same thing to all of us!
Figures. He makes up with us and he hooks up with us...
You guys hooked up?
John and I share something special.
Oh what, that they been both in your pants?
We share a vegan/nonviolent outlook on life.
Hippie slut.
Oh nice, Heather. It's not like everyone doesn't know that little Miss Cheerleader brings it on.
What, you too?
John and I belong together. He is the team captain and I am the head cheerleader.
Oh, I'm sorry, what kind of cheerleader?
Oh, like he'd take either of you two seriously?
Do not lump me with her!
Oh so what, you're now better than me?
Shut up.
, :

What?
, :

What?
Sorry.
You got something to say?
No, it's none of my business.
Okay, let me guess. Does he always use pet names like ""Baby"" and ""Sweetheart?"" Yeah, it's not out of affection, it's so he won't mix up your names. And he's all about an unspoken bond or something special, but never about a relationship. And the whole arrangement was your idea, so you feel guilty that he cheated.
Oh my God, you're dating John too?
No, I knew a guy like him... Skip.
I was so depressed, I couldn't even enjoy the break-up sex.
Oh my god, I'm such a slut!
It's not even my date and he still gets me out of my skirt!
John and I belong together. He's the varsity captain, and after all, I AM the head cheerleader.
Sorry what kind of cheerleader?
For you I don't have to give up all meat...
You know what, that was no accident!
He's mine!
Stay away from him!
Oh you little brat!
Girls, peace and love! C'mon you guys are fighting over -...
We're fighting over John Tucker, he's mine!
OH!
What the hell is your problem?
I am dating John Tucker.
ENOUGH! Let's get back in the game.
Darn it Coach!
Just let me get through. Just let me get them
PUT THOSE BALLS DOWN!
This guy is cheating on all of you and instead of taking it out on him, you are beating the shit out of each other?
LANGUAGE!
DETENTION! You, you, you, and YOU! Honestly...
Who is that?
I don't know. Pam Something.
John and I belong together. He's the varsity captain, and after all, I AM the head cheerleader.
Excuse me, what kind of cheerleader did you say?
I was so depressed I couldn't even enjoy the break-up sex.
Oh my God I am such a slut!
I want to bring down you know who.
Normally, I'm opposed to the slaughter of animals, but in John Tucker's case, I'll make an exception.
I don't even know him.
So, you don't even know anyone. You're like the Swiss, you're neutered.
Um, it's neutral. Kate, if the three of us tried this alone, we would kill each other. You brought us here. You showed us that we have something in common.
Exactly. We all want to kill John Tucker.
Wow. Okay.
She's right. I mean he always making me feel guilty.
It seems to me that if a guy treats you like that...
You'd break up with him, blah, blah, blah...
Even John would have another girlfriend in a second.
No, I didn't say break up. I'd get even.
Who are you?
I know, you're that girl that wigged out last year and got sent to rehab!
No, I...
Then you got taken away from bulimia.
No.
Fat camp?
No. My name is...
Hey, no talking!
My name is...
No talking!
You mean he was able to be intimate without being... intimate?
Unbelievable.
I'd hit him with my car if he wouldn't make body casts a fashion statement.
I can't believe I ate meat for him. I mean, it was fish, but still. I don't eat anything with a face.
It doesn't work like it will stop your hormone production.
Yeah and when you run out you will grow a mustache and a penis."
Jasper Palmer,AL,Granola Person,"Everything is a mythical, cosmic battle between faith and chance.
Maybe I shouldn't.
You already did. Take another one. Now cough. What do you taste?
Strawberries!
Strawberries? That's what it's called: Strawberry Cough!
Wicked!
So. You've got faith over here, right? And chance over there.
Like yin and yang.
Sort of.
Or Shiva and Shakti.
Lennon and McCartney!
Look, Julian and Theo.
Yeah, there you go! Julian and Theo met among a million protestors in a rally by chance. But they were there because of what they believed in in the first place, their faith. They wanted to change the world. And their faith kept them together. But by chance, Dylan was born.
This is him?
Yeah, that's him. He'd have been about your age. Magical child. Beautiful. Their faith put in praxis.
""Praxis""? What happened?
Chance. He was their sweet little dream. He had little hands, little legs, little feet. Little lungs. And in 2008, along came the flu pandemic. And then, by chance, he was gone. You see, Theo's faith lost out to chance. So, why bother if life's going to make its own choices?
Baby's got Theo's eyes.
Yeah.
Oh, boy. That's terrible. But, you know, everything happens for a reason.
That, I don't know. But Theo and Julian would always bring Dylan. He loved it here.
Pull my finger!
What did you do for your birthday?
Nothing.
Oh come on, you must have done something.
Nope. Woke up, felt like shit. Went to work, felt like shit.
That's called a hangover, Amigo.
So, the Human Project is havin' this dinner and all the wisest men in the world are there...
Human Project, why do people believe this crap? You know even if these people existed with these facilities in these secret locations, fuck me, that's strong! Even if they discovered the cure for infertility, doesn't matter! Too late. World went to shit. Know what? It was too late before the infertility thing happened, for fuck's sake.
I was just tryin' to tell a joke, man.
Oh, I'm sorry, go on.
No, I'm not tellin' it now!
No, c'mon Jasper, go on!
No, fuck it! I'm not tellin' it to you!
C'mon, I'm sorry!
Ok, the Human Project gives this great, big dinner for all the scientists and sages in the world. They're tossing around theories about the ultimate mystery: why are all the women infertile? Why can't we make babies anymore? So, some say it's genetic experiments, gamma rays, pollution, same ol', same ol'. So, anyway, in the corner, this Englishman's sitting, he hasn't said a word, he's just tuckin' in his dinner. So, they decide to ask him, they say, ""Well, why do you think we can't make babies anymore?"" And he looks up at 'em, he's chewin' on this great big wing and he says ""I haven't the faintest idea,"" he said, ""but this stork is quite tasty isn't he?""
Your baby is the miracle the whole world has been waiting for.
Here try this.
Yea, now what?
Cough!
Cough?
Yes cough!
You taste it? It tastes like strawberries!
I'm glad you don't take cream or sugar Amigo, losing you and Baby Diego in the same day... would be too hard to bare.
Well that was even worse, everybody crying. I mean... Baby Diego? Come on, the guy was a wanker!
Yeah, but he was the -youngest- wanker on Earth!

Max Dennison,AL,Granola Person,"Well, what does it say?
Well, it says to form a circle a salt to protect from zombies, witches, and old boyfriends.
And what about new boyfriends?
What happened?
A virgin lit the candle.
Welcome to High School Hell. I'm your host, Boris Karloff, Jr. Ha ha ha ha ha!
You've messed with the great and powerful Max! Now you must suffer the consequences! I'm going to summon the burning rain of death!

The burning rain of death?

It's the burning rain of death! Come, you fools!
No, no! He's a good zombie.
Hi Billy!
Wench! Trollop! You buck toothed, mop riding firefly from hell!
I've waited centuries to say that.
Say what you want; just don't breathe on me!
Billy! I killed you once, I shall kill you again, you maggoty malfeasence! Hang on to your heads!
Max, I'm not going up there. My friends at school told me all about that place. It's weird!
Dani, this is the girl of my dreams.
So take her to the movies like a normal person.
Dani! Look just do this one thing for me, and I'll do anything you say. Please? Please? Please?
Okay, okay. Next year, we go trick-or-treating as Wendy and Peter Pan...
... with tights or it's no deal.
Okay, okay, deal, deal.
Officer! Officer!
Officer, we need your help.
What's the problem?
Tell him.
Go ahead.
Well, um well, you see I just moved here. Well, you see? It's like this: I I um broke into the old Sanderson house and I brought the witches back from the dead. See, I even have the book.
You lit the Black Flamed Candle?
Yeah.
Come on. Okay, let's get on the sidewalk.
And he's a virgin.
Come here.
Are you a virgin?
Yeah.
Really?
Look, I'll get it tattooed on my forehead, okay?
Let's light this sucker and meet the old broads.
Hey, Max, how was school?
It sucked!
Hey, watch your language.
I can't believe you made me move here!
Hmm, he wasn't wearing any shoes.
Must be some form of protest.
Oh! Dad.
It's not Dad. It's Dadcula.
Oh, my goodness. Who must this charming young blood donor be?
Dad! Something terrible happened.
Dani? What's wrong? Wh
No, Dani's fine.
Good.
Excuse me. Come here.
Mom?
Mom?
Hmm?
What are you supposed to be?
Madonna. Well, you know. Well, obviously. Don't ya think?
Shoot, Max. Look, whatever it is, just tell me.
Come here.
What?
This cat here, Binx, right? He can talk. My brother's a virgin: he lit the black flame candle. The witches are back from the dead and they're after us. We need help.
How much candy have you had, honey?
Mom, I haven't O.D.'d. I haven't even had a piece. They're real witches, they can fly, and they're gonna eat all the kids in Salem. They're real!
All right, let's just find your father.
You saved my life.
I had to. I'm your big brother.
I love you, jerkface.
I love you, too.
Now you have no choice! You'll have to take me!
What a fool to give us thy life for thy sister's.
So let's have a butt.
No thanks, I don't smoke.
They're very health conscious in Los Angeles.
You got any cash Hollywood?
No.
Gee, we don't get any smokes from you. We don't get any cash. What am I supposed to do with my afternoon?
Maybe you could learn to breathe through your nose.
Whoa. Check out the new cross-trainers.
Cool.
Let me try them on.
Later, dude!
See you, Hollywood!
So, where're you from?
Los Angeles.

Yeah.

Ana Pascal,AL,Granola Person,"How are you?
I'm lousy. I'm being audited.
Of course.
By a real creep too.
I think I owe you an apology.
Really?
IRS agents, we're given rigorous aptitude tests before we can work. Unfortunately for you, we aren't tested on tact or good manners, so I apologize.
I ogled you. Sorry.
Okay, apology accepted. But only because you stammered.
Big flag-burning to get to?
Actually, it's my weekly evil-conspiracy and needlepoint group. You wanna come?
I left my thimbles and socialist reading material at home.
You keep your files like this?
No, actually I'm quite fastidious. I put them in this box just to screw with you.
I won't be paying, Mr. Crick. No matter how big the percent.
No, I know. But the percent determines how big your cell is.
Mr. Crick, it was a really awful day. I know, I made sure of it. So pick up the cookie, dip it in the milk, and eat it."
Ashley,AL,Granola Person,"You know how you told me that every night before you go to bed you'd pray that you'd get into Stanford?
Yeah?
Well the other night I prayed for something too.
What?
I prayed... that you wouldn't get into Stanford.
Why?
Well I didn't really think it was gonna work!
Look Shaun, I'm sorry you didn't get into Stanford. But if you think that going here is the only way that you can be the person you want to be, well then I just feel sorry for you.
I should have seen this coming. The one day I need my family to come through for me, they end up doing what they always do: my father goes ballistic, my mother gets plastered, and my brother burns down a building. It's like they've all come together in some evil conspiracy to prevent me from getting anywhere.
Is that what you think?
What else am I supposed to think?
You know, I really believed, that you wanted to go to Stanford, because you wanted to study with Marcus Skinner. But that's not it, is it?
What are you talking about?
You want to run away. You want to be free of everybody. And you think by coming up here, you're gonna' meet people who are smarter, and saner... and better. You know, if you went to Stanford, that'd be the end of us. It doesn't seem to me that thought's ever crossed your mind.
Oh, Ashley, come on!
Shaun, I'm sorry you didn't get into Stanford. But if you think that going here is the only way that you can be the person you want to be, well, then I just feel sorry for you."
Sheldon Mopes,AL,Granola Person,"When my brothers and I played cowboys and Indians, I was always the Chinese railroad worker.

I'll be in my office, the big one with a view!
They all have views, you dumb shit!
Not looking this way, cupcake!
So remember kids, a stepdad is a lot like a new puppy. They need patience and love while they adjust to their new surroundings. But remember - if he is ever abusive to you or mommy, what are the magic numbers?
9-1-1!
Thaaaaaaat's right!
You can't change the world but you can make a dent.
You try not to hurt anyone Roy... What would Jesus do?
Someone toss me a beach towel because my head is swimming.
Sometimes in this life, a man's gotta answer for his indiscretions!
It was a mistake! An honest mistake! I was just trying to help the children!
Oh, so you like kids, eh?
Oh, sure!
Oh, then I bet you know some fairy tales then.
Yeah!
Hey, Danny, tell him the one about the worthless prick that gets his head chopped off with an axe!
No! No! NOOOOOOOOO!
I don't think I feel so good about this all of a sudden, Tommy.
Then we took his head and played a little...
Okay, that's... way more information than I'd like to have at this point, thanks.
I never saw anyone get buzzed off of orange juice.
Let me tell you a secret - if you squirt a little liquid alfalfa in, it's blast off time.
This is the high life, Sheldon. You gotta get used to this. Pretty soon you're gonna be pissin' on hundred dollar bills just to see the look on Franklin's face!
I don't think I could ever do that. I have much too much respect for what that man accomplished.
Didn't she tell you of the love we once had. Passionate yet tender, old-fashioned yet experimental.
Randolph, you have lost your mind.
Oh, enlighten the lad, Nora. You were such a hot little brood mare, does the bridle still fit?
Hey, watch your mouth mister!
What experiments? I've had firmer handshakes, ya drunk.
Please, it's small but, it's fierce!
What about Wally the Whale?
Laura, how could you do it with Wally the Whale?
There she blows!
I don't believe this is happening. I can't believe you didn't tell me about this.
Listen, Sheldon, I'm not proud of it but, there was a time in my life when I was a bit of a kiddie host groupie.
You just fucked with the wrong rhino!
It's all about the dough, Shel. Once you get the money, you get the power. Once you get the power, you can have Smoochy walk out there with a dildo strapped to his head if you want.
I don't think I've thought of that idea specifically, but I? I do see where you're going with this.
Don't forget, this hit was meant for you, Shel. So from now on, wherever you go, we go.
I'll be fine.
Fine nothing! As Christ is my witness, no one is touching a hair on your fucking head! Spinner would have wanted it that way. Okay boys, let's all pray and get shit-faced.
Captain Kangaroo, like Jesus Christ, was someone you could really believe in. With those guys it wasn't about the bells and whistles and the rickety rackety, it was all about the work. Especially Jesus.
Now I'm not pointing any fingers, Lord knows you start pointing fingers and someone's gonna get poked. And I want you both to know that its not my intention to try and... poke either of you.
Don't talk to me like that, I am not your puppet.
Let's face it. Big junkies come from little junkies. We gotta nip this in the bud, Burke!
Has anyone ever suggested that maybe a little yoga, maybe a high colonic or two could loosen you up a lot?
This I guarantee: That fuckin' Randolph has seen his last rainbow. We're going to find him, cut off his balls, and shove 'em up his ass.
Well, maybe we should leave that for the cops, Tommy.
Cops won't do the ball thing, it's against procedure.
You work for Kidnet? Are you serious?
As a heart attack.
He's a pillow-biter, you know.
I wouldn't know anything about his sleeping disorders.
I'm telling you, Stokes cut some kind of deal with Buggy for the Smoochy slot
Wait a minute, Buggy Ding-Dong? The host of ""Buggy's Bumpy Railroad""?
Yeah, until he discovered the joys of Turkish black mule heroin.
That doesn't make any sense. Why would Stokes want to replace Smoochy with some smack addict?
I don't know.
Oh, man. Someone toss me a beach towel, cause my head is swimmin'!
My name is Moochy.
I think we've established that.

What?
Don't eat the eggs. We put LSD in the eggs.
And the water. I put LSD in the main water tank.
What? But, we drank the water!
Yeah!

It's fake.
What?

I can't dance, sir.

The Dark Side."
Peter Blood,AV,Loveable Rogue,"Who the devil may you be?
Peter Blood, Medicinae Baccalaureus.
Don't fling your French at me!
Latin, my dull friend. It means I'm a doctor.
Or a liar!
If your wit were as big as your voice, me dear, it's the great man you'd be by this.
You may find me great enough to hang you.
'Faith, yes, I don't doubt it. You've the looks and manners of a hangman.
Take him away. And the others, too.
Pirates! Spanish pirates!
This is what I call a timely interruption! Though what'll come of it - the devil himself only knows!
You would think of geraniums when every other able-bodied man is out fighting!
Hmm. It's out of favor I seem to be with you, my vinegary virgin.
Half the town is saying you're a Papist.
Why? Because I've the sense to sleep this night instead of rushing to my ruin in a hopeless attempt to put this Duke of Monmouth on the throne? He'd be even worse than King James. Make haste with that cloak there, my pretty one.
And the other half of the town that defends you claims that you're just a coward.
Mrs. Barlow, me darlin', you can tell 'em if you like that I've been most everywhere that fighting was in evidence: I fought for the French against the Spanish and the Spanish against the French... and I learned me seamanship in the Dutch navy. And having had adventure enough in six years to last me six lives, I came here. Hung up the sword and picked up the lancet; became a man of peace and not of war... a healer, not a slayer. And that I'm going to be as long as I'm on top of the sod and not under it.
Faith, there's a witness that you can't deny: yourself, sir! For if I'm not a physician, how is it I know that you're a dying man? The death to which you're dooming hundreds of poor men daily - in a frantic effor to send their souls to perdition before your own - is a light pleasantry compared to the bleeding death in the lungs to which the great Judge has condemned you.
My business was with his wounds, not his politics
Did you know the law that any person who does knowingly receive, harbor, comfort or succor a rebel is as guilty as if he himself bore arms?
I only knew my sacred duty as a physician.
Your sacred duty, rogue, is to your king!
I thought it was to my fellow man.
Up that rigging, you monkeys! Aloft! There's no chains to hold you now. Break out those sails and watch them fill with the wind that's carrying us all to freedom!
Nuttall, me lad, there's just one other little thing. Do you think you could find me a good stout piece of timber? About so thick and so long?
Yes, I think so.
Then do so and lash it to your spine - it needs stiffening. Courage! We'll join you at midnight.
We're sinking! What should we do?
Do? We'll board a ship that's not sinking!
It's a fearful thing to send a man's soul to perdition, but I am bound by my conscience and by my love of my king to deal out justice. Therefore, I instruct you gentlemen of the jury, that in as much as Peter Blood has admitted aiding a traitor to your king, you do bring in a verdict of guilty that he may be hanged for the high treason that he has committed.
What a creature must sit on the throne who lets a man like you deal out his justice.
It seems that you're continually doing me favors. Faith, I don't know why.
Neither do I. Yes I do. It's because you're so very grateful and always thank me so prettily.
Sure now, you don't blame me for resenting you and your favors.
This is interesting. I've had men tell me they had reasons for admiring me... and some few have even laid claims to reasons for loving me. But for a man to store up reasons for resenting me... how refreshing! You must tell me a few of them.
First, is reason enough: you bought me. I've had no lack of experiences in my time; but to be bought and sold was a new one. I was in no mood to thank my purchaser.
That I can understand. Go on.
I've resented you because your name's Bishop. My thoughts have lumped you with your uncle. How was I to know, be dad, that a devil could have... that a devil could have an angel for a niece.
From a resentful man that is a pretty fair compliment.
Didn't I tell you I was a gunner, sir?
You did that, you son of a Yorkshire steer - and bless your rusty heart, it's a gunner you are!
Doctor Blood! Doctor Blood!
Who, who is it?
That we'll know better when you've opened the door.
Me?
My mistake, after I've opened the door.
You'll not take her while I live.
Then I'll take her when you're dead.
Oh, oh have mercy, your Excellency. Have mercy.
Arabella, why are you here?
Uncle. I have been pleading with the governor on your behalf, asking him to be as merciful as you would be cruel. Uncle, this is the governor.
Good morning, Uncle.
It's entirely innocent, I am!
Peter Blood... guilty or not guilty?
It's entirely innocent, I am!
Take the stand and face his Lordship.
Are you guilty or not guilty? You must use the right words.
Words is it? Oh. Not guilty. And speaking of words, I'd like to say a few about the injustice of keeping an innocent man locked up for three months in such filth and heat and ill-feeding... that my chief regret is I didn't try to pull down the filthy fellow that sits on the throne!
Men, I've just heard a startling piece of news - King James is kicked out of England and good King William reigns in his stead.
For me this changes the shape of the world. For you who were slaves with me, it means that we're no longer slaves, that we once more have a home and a country. For you who are English it means a chance to fight for your native land... for I now propose to sail into Port Royal and take it from the French! Those of you who are not English will have to be content with fighting for Captain Blood... and the loot you'll find on the French ships. Are you willing to fight, men?
For those of you who aren't English it means a chance to fight for Captain Blood *and* the loot you find on the French ships!
It's a truly royal clemency we're granted, my friends... one well worthy of King James. He spares us the mercifully quick extinction of the hangman's rope... and gives us the slow death of slavery. He grants us our lives in exchange for living death. Faith, it's an uncertain world entirely.
Oh, forgive me for not recognizing you, Dr. Blood. You're so changed... and for the better.
The Governor tells me I have you to thank for that.
You don't sound very grateful, Dr. Blood.
Do you suppose I'd be grateful for an easy life, when my friends are treated like animals? Faith, it's they deserve your favors, not I. They're all honest rebels. I was snoring in my bed while they were trying to free England from an unclean tyrant.
I believe you're talking treason.
I hope I'm not obscure.
Miss Bishop, it's difficult for an Irishman to apologize; but I hope you can forgive me for having thought badly of you.
I will if you tell me how you think of me now.
How I think of you now? I think of you... I think of you as the woman who owns me - her slave. But I think the man is lucky who can count you his friend.
I think you know YOU can.
Your slave is grateful for all marks of favor.
When you forget your slavery and go so far...
Now there you're mistaken. However far this slave may go, he won't forget. That's a characteristic that the Irish have in common with the elephants.
We, the undersigned, are men without a country. Outlaws in our own land and homeless outcasts in any other. Desperate men, we go to seek a desperate fortune. Therefore, we do, here and now, band ourselves into a brotherhood of bucaneers... to practice the trade of piracy on the high seas. We, the hunted, will now hunt! Therefore, to that end, we enter into the following Articles of Agreement: First: We pledge ourselves to be bound together as brothers in a life and death friendship, sharing alike in fortune and in trouble. Second Article: All monies and valuables which may come into our possession shall be lumped together into a common fund... and from this fund shall first be taken the money to fit, rig, and provision the ship. After that, the recompense each shall receive who is wounded is follows: for the loss of a right arm: 600 pieces of eight; left arm: 500; for the loss of a right leg: 500; left leg: 400.
A fella can get rich if he's lucky.
Greedy, greedy.
If a man conceal any treasure captured or fail to place it in the general fund, he shall be marooned. Set ashore on a deserted isle, and there left with a bottle of water, a loaf of bread and a pistol with one load. If a man shall be drunk on duty he shall recieve the same fate. And if a man shall molest a woman captive against her will... he, too, shall receive the same punishment. These Articles entered into this 20th day of June, in the year 1687.
Now, men, you've heard the Agreement. It's the world against us and us against the world!
""His hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him."" Genesis, 16th chapter, 12th verse.
Those of you in favor of these Articles raise your right hands and say, ""Aye!""
Have we an English battle flag on board, Hagthorpe?
We have every manner of battle flag on board, including a lady's purple petticoat.
No, wait. I've a better idea. When an English lion creeps up on a nest of French foxes he does well to wear a bushy tail. Hoist the French flag, Hagthorpe.
Aye, sir.
And that my friend ends a partnership that should never have begun.
Such a partnership requires sober thought. My poor head has been dancing with rum this whole week past.
Even so drunk, your brain is the greatest this side the Carribean. With your brain and my strength, there is nothing we cannot do.
But there's very little I can't do all by myself.
Women will be the death of yet, Levasseur.
Then it is a very pleasant way to die, even if it is expensive.
The greatest captain on the coast, is it? Well be dead when he thinks the greatest captain on the coast has just made the greatest mistake the most ordinary common fool could make.
I must congratulate you, Levasseur. I didn't so much as sight a sail.
The fortunes of war, my partner.
And these are also the fortune of war?
Indeed fortunes, a noble Englishmen and the niece of the governor of Jamaica.
Really? I suppose congratulations are again in order, but have you forgotten there is an article in our agreement forbidding the taking of women prisoners?
That's a foolish article of yours.
I was not aware you regarded it so when we signed it."
Capt. Louis Renault,AV,Loveable Rogue,"What in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
The waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
I was misinformed.
What is your nationality?
I'm a drunkard.
That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
How can you close me up? On what grounds?
I'm shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
Your winnings, sir.
Oh, thank you very much.
Everybody out at once!
Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then, and it all adds up to one thing: you're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
But, Richard, no, I... I...
Now, you've got to listen to me! You have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten, we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn't that true, Louie?
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.
You're saying this only to make me go.
I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us, we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it. Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life.
But what about us?
We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we, we lost it until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.
When I said I would never leave you.
And you never will. But I've got a job to do, too. Where I'm going, you can't follow. What I've got to do, you can't be any part of. Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Someday you'll understand that.
Now, now...
Here's looking at you kid.
And remember, this gun is pointed right at your heart.
That is my *least* vulnerable spot.
Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
It's not particularly my beloved Paris.
Can you imagine us in London?
When you get there, ask me!
Hmmh! Diplomatist!
How about New York?
Well there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.
You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.
We musn't underestimate ""American blundering"". I was with them when they ""blundered"" into Berlin in 1918.
What was the meaning of that phone call?
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?
Ask Mr. Rick.
Get away from that phone!
I would advise you not to interfere.
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault and I'm willing to shoot you.
Hello?
Put that phone down!
Get me the radio tower.
PUT IT DOWN!
Major Strasser's been shot.
Round up the usual suspects.
Oh no, Emil, please. A bottle of your best champagne, and put it on my bill.
Very well, sir.
Captain, please...
Oh, please, monsieur. It is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear up the bill. It is very convenient.
By the way, last night you evinced an interest in Señor Ugarte.
Yes.
I believe you have a message for him?
Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?
You would find the conversation a trifle one-sided. Señor Ugarte is dead.
Oh.
I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided yet whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.
I've often speculated why you don't return to America. Did you abscond with the church funds? Run off with a senator's wife? I like to think you killed a man. It's the Romantic in me.
It was a combination of all three.
Major Strasser has been shot... round up the usual suspects.
How can you close me up? On what grounds?
I'm shocked... shocked to find that gambling is going on in there.
Your winnings sir.
Oh, thank you very much.
This is the end of the chase.
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
Is that a serious offer?
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
Make it ten. I'm only a poor corrupt official.
Have you lost your mind?
I have. Sit down!
Put that gun down!
I don't want to shoot you, but I will if you take one more step!
Under the circumstances I will sit down.
Captain Renault... may I?
Oh no! Not here please! Come to my office tomorrow morning. We'll do everything businesslike.
We'll be there at six!
I'll be there at ten.
Carl, see that Major Strasser gets a good table, one close to the ladies.
I have already given him the best, knowing he is German and would take it anyway.
Hello Rick.
Hello Louis.
How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that. Someday they may be scarce. You know, now I think I shall pay a call on Yvonne. Maybe get her on the rebound. Hmm?
When it comes to women, you're a true democrat.
Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca with less scruples than I.
What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?
Because, one, you bet 10.000 francs he'd escape. Two, you've got the letters of transit. Don't bother to deny it. And you might want to do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't like them either.
They're all excellent reasons.
My dear Ricky, you overestimate the influence of the Gestapo. I don't interfere with them and they don't interfere with me. In Casablanca I am master of my fate! I am...
Major Strasser is here, sir!
You were saying?
Excuse me.
Who is Rick?
Mamoiselle, you are in Rick's! And Rick is...
Who is he?
Well, Rick is the kind of man that... well, if I were a woman, and I were not around, I should be in love with Rick. But what a fool I am talking to a beautiful woman about another man.
In 1935, you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain, on the Loyalist side.
I got well paid for it on both occasions.
The *winning* side would have paid you *much better*.
Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this café, but we know that *you've* never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.
Oh? I thought it was because I let you win at roulette.
That is *another* reason.
No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa... or I should say two?
Why two?
He is traveling with a lady.
He'll take one.
I think not. I have seen the lady.
We are very honored tonight, Rick. Major Strasser is one of the reasons the Third Reich enjoys the reputation it has today.
You repeat *Third* Reich as though you expected there to be others!
Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
Realizing the importance of the case, my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects.
If he ever gets a *word* in, it'll be a major Italian *victory*.
She was asking about you earlier in a way that made me very jealous...
*You* are becoming your *own* best *customer*!
Why Ricky, I'm *pleased* with you- *Now* you're beginning to live like a *Frenchman*!
I was informed that you were the most beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca. That was a *gross* understatement.
You're very kind.
Is everything ready?
I have the letters right here.
Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
Sam's piano.
Serves me right for not being musical.
Rick, have you got those letters of transit?
Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed."
Abu,AV,Loveable Rogue,"I am Abu the thief, son of Abu the thief, grandson of Abu the thief.
How can you be so ungrateful?
Grateful? Slaves are not grateful. Not for their freedom!
Where are we now ?
Above the roof... of the world
Has the world got a roof ?
Of course. Supported by seven pillars, and the seven pillars are set on the shoulders of a genie whose strength is beyond thought, and the genie stands on an eagle, and the eagle on a bull, and the bull on a fish, and the fish swims in the sea of eternity..."
Eames,AV,Loveable Rogue,"You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling.
Eames, I am impressed.
Your condescension, as always, is much appreciated, Arthur, thank you.
Inception. Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible...
No, it's perfectly possible. It's just bloody difficult.
So, once we've made the plant, how do we go out? Hope you have something more elegant in mind than shooting me in the head?
A kick.
What's a kick?
This, Ariadne, would be a kick

""I will split up my father's empire."" Now, this is obviously an idea that Robert himself would choose to reject. Which is why we need to plant it deep in his subconscious. Subconscious is motivated by emotion, right? Not reason. We need to find a way to translate this into an emotional concept.
How do you translate a business strategy into an emotion?
That's what we're here to figure out, right? Now, Robert's relationship with his father is stressed, to say the least.
Well, can we run with that? We could suggest to him breaking up his father's company as a ""screw-you"" to the old man.
No, 'cause I think positive emotion trumps negative emotion every time. We all yearn for reconciliation, for catharsis. We need Robert Fischer to have a positive emotional reaction to all this.
Alright, we'll try this, umm... ""My father accepts that I want to create for myself, not follow in his footsteps.""
That might work.
Might? We're gonna need to do a little better than 'might'.
Oh, thank you for your contribution, Arthur.
Forgive me for wanting a little specificity, Eames.
Specificity?
That price on my head, was that dead or alive?
Not sure. See if he starts shooting.
Brain function in the dream will be about twenty times to normal. When you enter a dream within that dream, the effect is compounded: it's three dreams, that's ten hours times twen...
I'm sorry, uh, maths was never my strong subject. How much time is that?
It's a week the first level down. Six months the second level down, and... the third level...
...is ten years! Who would wanna be stuck in a dream for ten years?
Depends on the dream.
If we are gonna perform Inception then we need imagination.
What about his security? It's gonna get worse as we go deeper.
I think we run with Mr. Charles.
No.
Who's Mr. Charles?
Bad idea.
The second we get in that hotel with Fischer, his security is gonna be all over us. We run with Mr. Charles like we did on the Stein job.
So you've done it before?
Yeah, and it didn't work. The subject realized he was dreaming and his subconscious tore us to pieces.
Excellent. But you learned a lot, right?
They come here every day to sleep?
No. They come to be woken up. The dream has become their reality. Who are you to say otherwise, son?
Great. Thank you. So, now we're trapped in Fischer's mind battling his own private army, and if we get killed, we'll be lost in limbo till our brains turn to scrambled egg.
You couldn't have peed before you went under?
Sorry.
A bit too much free champagne before take off, Yusuf?
Ha ha, bloody ha.
Hey, I see you've changed.
Sorry?

Ahh... I'm sorry. I mistook you for a friend.
Well, good-looking fellow, I'm sure.
That's Fischer's projection of Browning. Let's follow him and see how he behaves.
Why?
Because how he acts will tell us if Fischer is starting to suspect him just the way we want him to.
Fischer's OK, unless he gets car-sick.
Eames, I am impressed.
Your condescension, as always, is much appreciated, Arthur. Thank you.
Ah. So, this is your idea of losing a tail, huh?
Different tail.
All right, we continue on with the job, and we do it as fast as possible, and we get out using the kick, just like before.
Forget it. We go any deeper, we just raise the stakes. I am sitting this one out on this level, boys.
You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling.
What you have to do it start at the absolute basic.
Your condescension, as always, is much appreciated, Arthur, thank you!"
Wolverine,AV,Loveable Rogue,"Hey! It's me.
Prove it!
You're a dick.
Okay.
You actually go outside in these things?
Well, what would you prefer, yellow spandex?
When they come out... does it hurt?
Every time.
You know, you should wear your seat belt.
Now look, kid, I don't need advice on auto...
Logan, is that you?
Something is wrong.
Come on. We need to regroup.
There's just one problem.
You're not part of the group!
The first boy I ever kissed ended up in a coma for three weeks. I can still feel him inside my head. It's the same with you.
There's not many people that'll understand what you're going through. But I think this guy, Xavier, is one of them. He seems to genuinely want to help you. And that's a rare thing, for people like us. So... what do you say, we give these geeks one more shot?
C'mon, I'll take care of you.
You promise?
Yeah... Yeah, I promise.
Why do none of you understand what I'm trying to do? Those people down there- they control our fate and the fate of every other mutant! Well, soon our fate will be theirs.
You're so full of shit! If you're really so righteous, it'd be you in that thing.
Where are you going?
To find her.
How?
The traditional way: look!
Ah, Logan. I'd like you to meet Ororo Monroe, also called Storm. This is Scott Summers, also called Cyclops. They saved your life. I believe you already know Dr. Jean Grey. You are in my School for the Gifted for Mutants. You'll be safe here from Magneto.
What's a Magneto?
A very powerful mutant. He believes that a war is brewing between mutants and the rest of humanity. I've been following his activities for some time. The man who attacked you is an associate of his called Sabertooth.
Sabertooth?
Storm.
What do they call you? ""Wheels""? This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Students.
And Cyclops, right?
You wanna get outta my way?
Logan, it's been almost fifteen years, hasn't it? Living from day to day, moving from place to place, with no memory of who or what you are.
Shut up!
Give me a chance. I might be able to help you find some answers.
How do you know?
You're not the only one with special gifts.
You going to tell me to stay away from your girl?
If I had to do that, she wouldn't be my girl.
Well, then I guess you've got nothing to worry about, do ya, Cyclops?
It must burn you up that a boy like me saved your life, huh? Gotta be careful. I might not be there next time. Oh, and Logan - stay away from my girl.
What did she do to me...?
Whenever Rogue touches someone, she takes their energy: their life force. In the case of mutants, she absorbs their gifts for a short while; in your case your ability to heal.
Felt like she killed me...
If she held on any longer, she could have.
How is she?
She's fine.
I think she's still taken with you.
Well you can tell her... my heart belongs to... someone else.
I think you'll be comfortable here.
Where's your room?
With Scott, down the hall.
Is that your gift? Putting up with that guy?
Actually, I'm telekinetic. I can move things with my mind.
Really? What kind of things?
All kinds of things. I also have some telepathic ability.
Like the Professor?
Nowhere near that powerful. But he's teaching me to develop it.
I'm sure he is. So read my mind.
I'd rather not.
C'mon. You afraid you might like it?
I doubt it.
Magneto's right: there is a war coming. Are you sure you're on the right side?
At least I've chosen a side.
All right, we can insert here at the George Washington Bridge, come around the bank just off of Manhattan, land on the far side of Liberty Island, here.
What about harbor patrol, radar?
If they have anything that can pick up our jet, they deserve to catch us.
Wait a second! You said this machine draws its power from Magneto, and that it weakened him.
Yes, in fact it nearly killed him.
He's going to transfer his power to Rogue and use her to power the machine.
You owe me some money.
Come on, Stu.
No one takes a beating like that without a mark to show for it.
Come on, Stu...
I know what you are.
You lost your money. You keep this up you'll lose something else.
Gotta get her out of there. Cyclops, can you hit it?
The ring's moving too fast.
Just shoot it!
I'll kill her!
Well, it certainly is a big, round room.
You could fly right over the torch.
Then let me go. If I don't make it, then at least you can still blast the damn thing!
All right, do it. Jean use your power, try to steady him.
Hang on to something.
Jean...
Scott, when I tell you, open your eyes.
No!
Trust me.
You drop something?
This is a military base situated near Alkali Lake. It isn't much, but if you go there, you might get a few clues as to what happened to you.
Thank you.
Are you going to say goodbye to her?
Sorry.
You call that a landing?
Hey, bub, I'm not finished with you yet.
So... couldn't wait to get my shirt off again.
This is mine!
That tickles.
Hey.
Hey!
How are you feeling?
Fantastic."
Kevin Flynn,BA,Playful Hacker,"Hey! Hold it right there!
Yes.
What do you mean, ""yes""?
Yes.
Is that all you can say?
No.
Know anything else?
Yes.
Positive and negative, huh? You're a Bit.
Yes.
Well, where's your program? Isn't he going to miss you?
No.
*I'm* your program?
Yes.
Another mouth to feed.
Yesyesyesyesyes!
Pretty good driving, huh?
No!
Who asked you?
On the other side of the screen, it all looks so easy.
There's nothing special about you. You're just an ordinary program.
So are you, one that should have been erased.
You invented Space Paranoids?
Paranoids, Matrix Blaster, Vice Squad, a whole slew of them. I was this close to starting my own little enterprise, man. But enter another software engineer. Not so young, not so bright, but very very sneaky. Ed Dillinger. So one night, our boy Flynn, he goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file. I get nothing on there, it's a big blank. Okay, now we take you three months later. Dillinger presents ENCOM with five video games, that's *he's* invented. The slime didn't even change the names, man! He gets a big, fat promotion. And thus begins his meteoric rise to... what is he now, Executive V.P.?
Senior exec.
*Senior* exec...?
Meanwhile, the kids are putting eight million quarters *a week* into Paranoids machines. I don't see a dime except what I squeeze out of here.
I still don't understand why you want to break into the system.
*Because*, man, *somewhere* in one of these memories is the *evidence*! If I got in far enough, I could reconstruct it!
You shouldn't have come back, Flynn.
Hey, hey, hey, it's the big Master Control Program everybody's been talking about.
Sit right there; make yourself comfortable. Remember the time we used to spend playing chess together?
That isn't going to do you any good, Flynn.
I'm afraid... Stop! Please! You realize I cannot allow this!
How are you going to run the universe if you can't answer a few unsolvable problems, huh? Come on, big fella, let's see what you got.
I'd like to go against you and see what your made of.
You know, you look nothing like your pictures.
I'm warning you. You're entering a big error, Flynn.
I'm going to have to put you on the game grid.
Games? You want games? I'll give you games...
Alan?
Where did you hear that name?
Well that's your name, isn't it?
The name of my User. How did you know?
I'm a program from a User that knows Alan.
What good will that do?
I'm gonna jump! It's the only way to help Tron!
Don't! You'll be de-rezzed!
Don't worry.
Clu, we don't have much time to find that file. This is top priority.
Yes, sir. I know, sir,
This just isn't correcting my bank statement or phone bill problem, okay - this is a must.
I understand, sir.
Come on, you scuzzy data, be in there. Come on.
Try to look official. Here comes the boss.
Pick me up in an hour. Thanks.
Greetings, programs.
It's time I leveled with you. I'm what you guys call a User.
You're a User?
I took a wrong turn somewhere.
If you are a User, then everything you've done has been according to a plan.
Ha! You wish! Well, you know what it was like. You just keep doin' what it looks like what you're supposed to be doin', no matter how crazy it seems.
Well, that's the way it is for programs, yes.
I hate to disappoint you, pal, but most of the time, that's the way it is for Users too.
Stranger and stranger.
You were never much for small talk, were you?
She still leave her clothes all over the floor?
Flynn!
No!
Alan!
I mean, not that often.
Now you can see why all his friends are 14 years old!
Touche, touche.
Oh, man, this isn't happening, it only thinks it's happening.
Vacate entry port, program! I said, move out!
Hey! Look, if this is about those parking tickets, I can explain everything, okay?
Who's that guy?
That's Tron. He fights for the Users.
I shouldn't have written all of those tank programs.
Hey Flynn, how'd you do it?
It's all in the wrists.
This is Blue Leader to Blue Bikes. Run these guys into your jet walls.
Copy Blue Leader.
Copy Blue Leader.
This is Gold-1 to Gold-2 and 3. Split up. Take them one-on-one.
Watch it! Watch it!
Aah!
Taking him into the maze.
This is it. Come on. Gold-3 to Gold-2 and 1. I'm getting out of here right now, and you guys are invited.
Got it.
Ready?
Ready!
So long, suckers!
Greetings, programs!
Video game warriors escaping game grid. This is an illegal exit. You must return to game grid. Repeat! This is an illegal exit. You must return to the grid.
Gold-3 to Gold-2. Those demons are coming down.
Get them! Send out every game tank in the grid!
Get them!
Now for some real User power.
Greetings, programs.
Did we make it?
Yeah.
Hooray for our side.
Flynn, are you embezzling?
""Embezzling"" is such an ugly word, Mr. Bradley.
Like the man says, there's no problems, only solutions.
Look... just so I can tell my friends what this dream is about, okay? Where am I?
You're a... guest of the Master Control Program.
Oh, great.
They're going to make you play video games.
No sweat. I play video games better than anybody.
You are going to stick with me, right?
What for? You're the one who never needed help, remember?
Come on, I'm - I'm scared of the dark. All this technology scares me.
Damn recognizer. Just go straight! I gotta get to that I/O tower.
Hey Ram, what were you, you know, before?
I was an actuarial program. Worked for a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling helping folks plan for their future needs. Of course, if you take the payments as an annuity over the years, the cost is really quite minimal.
Okay, Clu, tonight we check everything in ENCOM.
Come on, come on. Where are you?
There you are. Clu?
Yes, sir?
Clu, we don't have much time left to find that file. This is top priority.
Yes, sir. I know, sir.
This isn't just correcting my bank statement or phone bill problem again. This is a must.
I understand, sir.
Now, I wrote you.
Yes, sir.
I taught you everything I know about the system.
Thank you sir, but I'm not sure...
No buts, Clu. That's for Users. Now, you're the best Program that's ever been written. You're dogged and relentless, remember?
Let me at 'em!
That's the spirit. Now keep that tank rolling, and I'll try and cover you from this end. Go."
Sam Flynn,BA,Playful Hacker,"Flynn shared them with me. I've read them all.
Huh. Light reading. Tolstoy, Dovstoyevski, I Ching. ""Journey Without a Goal"". Must have a killer ending.
Flynn is teaching me about the art of the selfless. About removing oneself from the equation. But between you and me, Jules Verne is my favorite. Do you know Jules Verne?
Sure.
What's he like?
Dad?
Sam.
Long time.
You have no idea.
Alan, you're acting like I'm going to find him sittin' at work, just, ""Hey, kiddo, lost track of time.""
Wouldn't that be something.
Your disc. Dad, it's gone.
It is.
I'm sorry. I know I messed up. We can go back. I can go back.
No, we stay together.
Dad, I can do this.
You've done enough already! Sam, you're really...
You're messing with my Zen thing, man.
You can't steal something that's designed to be given away free.
You remember that night when you didn't come home? You said...
I said I'd show you the Grid. Should have seen this place back then. Couldn't wait to show it to you.
Must have been something before Clu screwed it up.
No, no, he's... he's me. I screwed it up, chasing after perfection, chasing after what was right in front of me.
Right in front of me.
Look what you've accomplished. It's incredible.
Sam... I'd have given it all up for one more day with you.
She risked herself for me.
Some things are worth the risk.
Why are you here, Alan?
I was paged last night.
Oh, man, still rocking the pager? Good for you.
Yeah, your Dad once told me I had to sleep with it, and I still do. Page came from your Dad's office at the arcade.
So?
So? That number's been disconnected for twenty years. Sam, two nights before he disappeared, he came to my house. ""I've cracked it,"" he kept saying. He said he was about genetic algorithms, quantum teleportation. He said he was about to change everything. Science, medicine, religion. He wouldn't have left that, Sam.
He wouldn't have left you.
Uh, can somebody tell me what the...
... Hey, Hey. It's got a zipper...
This can't be good.
Attention, Program. You will receive, an identity disc. Everything you do, or learn, will be imprinted on this disc. If you, lose your disc, or fail, to follow commands, you will be subject to immediate de-resolution.
Marrying complete, disc activated and syncronized, proceed to games.
Games?
What am I supposed to do?
Survive.
Clu! Remember what you came for.
Dad!
I knew I beat you, and still you did all this, for him?
No... no, why?
He's my son!
Go!
Dad!
Sam! It's time!
Sam, it's what he wants!
I'm not leaving you!
Take her!
Yes!
Goodbye, kiddo.
No!
Now that is a big door.
Greetings, Program! I'm Castor! Your host. Provider of any and all, entertainment and diversions.
At your service.
I'm looking for Zuse.
Indeed.
Many are.
Where can I find him?
This, prettiness,
is a conversation best had behind closed doors. Perhaps we should retire to my private lounge.
Ah! Designed it myself, you know. It's true! I'm steppin' away for moment, boys!
Change the scheme, alter the mood. Electrify the boys and girls if you'd be so kind.
Excellent words, sir. Were you pleased with my execution? The crowd seemed quite energized.
It wasn't meant for them.
What's this? What do you do with this?
I'll give you a hint, not that.
What's next, Sam?
Guess we're suppose to change the world.
Come on, I want to show you something.
She's an ISO.
Yeah. The last ISO.
All this time, you were just protecting her.
She's the miracle, man. Everything I ever worked for. ""A digital frontier to reshape the human condition.""
I always thought that was a plug line.
In our world, she can change everything.
Your father was the creator.
Where do I find him?
Make it there alive and he'll find you.
What's she doing?
Taking herself out of the equation.
I have a three-inch version of you on my shelf!
Combatants Three and Eleven - Disc Wars.

You definitely didn't do that!
Wait, what's your plan?
I'm a User, I'll improvise.
Light jets. Here they come.
Sam, take the turret.
Huh?
Man, I'm all over this.
What am I supposed to do?
Survive.
My disk is everything, Sam. It's the master key, the golden ticket. The way out. And not just for me.
What do you mean?
Our worlds are more connected than anyone knows. Clu figures if I can be in...
He can be out?
With my disk, it's possible.
And then what?
Game over. The guy doesn't dig imperfection. What's more imperfect than our world?
What's it like?
The sun?
Yeah.
Wow. I've never had to describe it. Warm, radiant... Beautiful.
Ice caps are melting, war in the Middle East, Lakers/Celtics back at it. I don't know, rich are getting richer, poor are getting poorer. Cell phones, online dating, Wi-fi.
What's Wi-fi?
Wireless interlinking.
Of digital devices?
Yeah.
Huh. I thought of that in '85.
I'm Quorra!
They're turning around!
Not by choice. Their vehicles aren't designed to go off grid. They'll not function on this terrain.
What about us?
Obviously not.
Where are you taking me?
Patience, Sam Flynn. All of your questions will be answered soon.
I've come to meet Zuse.
You just did.
There's someone I once knew. A program named Zuse, who fought alongside the ISOs. I, haven't seen him in a long time. But they say, he still runs the underground, manages the dissident factions, forges data, for the rogue programs. Moves them around the grid. They say he can get anyone, anywhere.
Where do I find him?
This is his sector. Make it there alive, and he'll find you."
Riley Poole,BA,Playful Hacker,"What do you see?
2:22.
What time is it now?
Almost 3.
We missed it.
No, we didn't. We didn't miss it because... you don't know this? I know something about history that you don't know.
I'd be very excited to learn about it, Riley.
Hold on one second, let me just take in this moment. This is cool. Is this how you feel all the time? Well, except now.
Riley!
All right! What I know is that daylight savings wasn't established until World War I. If it's 3 p.m. now that means that in 1776 it would be 2 p.m.
Riley, you're a genius.
You all right?
No, those - those lunatics...
You're not hurt, are you?
You're *all* lunatics!
You hungry?
What?
Are you all right?
Still a little on-edge from being shot at but I'll be fine, thanks for asking.
Yeah, well *I'm* not all right! Those men have the Declaration of Independence!
She *lost* it?
*They* don't have it.
See? Okay? Now could you *please* stop shouting?
Give me that!
You're *still* shouting, and it's really starting to annoy. You would do well, Dr. Chase, to be a little more *civilized* in this instance.
If that's the *real* one, what did *they* get?
A souvenir. I thought it'd be a good idea to have a duplicate, turns out I was right. I actually had to pay for the souvenir *and* the real one, so you owe me $35, plus tax.
Genius.
Who *were* those men?
Just the guys we *warned* you were going to try to steal the Declaration.
And *you* didn't believe us!
We did the only thing we could do to keep it safe.
Verdammt! Give me that!
You know something? You're shouting again.
Pretty sure she was swearing too.
Well, we probably deserved *that.*
It's a big blue-ish green man... with a strange-looking goatee... I'm guessing that's significant.
How do a bunch of guys with hand tools build all this?
Same way they built the pyramids - and the Great Wall of China.
Yeah... the aliens helped them.
It's surrounded by guards and video monitors and little families from Iowa and little kids on their eighth grade field trips.
Riley, are you crying?
Look... Stairs.
Do you know what the preservation room is for?
Delicious jams and jellies?
It's invisible.
Oh! Right.
And that's where we lost the Department of Homeland Security.
When are we gonna get there? I'm hungry. This car smells weird.
And he dragged you two into this nonsense?
Literally.
I volunteered.
I have to settle with 1%. One stinkin' percent. Half of one percent, actually.
I'm sorry for your suffering, Riley.
This is... huge.
Prison... huge. You are gonna go to prison. You know that, right?
Yeah, probably.
Well... that would... bother most people.
It took you all of two seconds to decide to steal the Declaration of Independence.
Yeah, but I didn't think I was going personally have to tell my dad about it.
Why can't they just say, 'go to this place, here's the treasure, spend it wisely'?
What led you to assume there's this invisible map?
We found an engraving on the stem of a 200-year-old pipe.
Owned by the Free Masons.
May I see the pipe?
We don't actually have it.
Did Bigfoot take it?
How do you look?
Not bad.
Mazel tov!
What?
It's just that... the last time this was here... it was being signed.
I'm so sorry I dropped you - I had to save the Declaration!
No, don't be. I would have done exactly the same to you.
Really?
Yeah.
I would've dropped you both! Freaks.
It's Valley Forge.
Valley... I don't have that on my computer.
It's Valley Forge. She pressed E and L twice.
Valley Forge was a turning point in the Revolutionary War.
Can I marry your brain?
You can't *seriously* intend to run chemical tests on the Declaration of Independence... in the back of a moving van!
We have a clean room environment all set up: EDS suits, a particulate air filtration system, the whole shebang.
Really?
Okay, Ben, pay attention. I've brought you to the Library of Congress. Why? Because it's the biggest library in the world. Over 20 million books. And they're all saying the same exact thing: Listen to Riley.
Look... this is a waste of time. How could a ship wind up way out here?
Well, I'm no expert but... it could be that the hydrothermic properties of this region produce hurricane-force ice storms that cause the ocean to freeze and then melt and then refreeze, resulting in a semisolid migrating land mass that would land a ship right around here.
Ben, the, uh, the mean D-declaration lady is behind you.
What do you care? You got the girl.
, :
That's true.
, :
That's true.
Yeah, rub it in.
Enjoy your spoils.
Who wants to go down the creepy tunnel inside the tomb first?
Do you actually know who the first person to suggest daylight savings was?
, :
Benjamin Franklin.
, :
Benjamin Franklin.
Our evil plan is working.
For the record, Ben, I like the house.
You know, I chose this estate because in 1812 Charles Carroll met...
Yeah, someone that did something in history and had fun. Great. Wonderful.
Could have had a bigger house.
So if it's in invisible ink, how do we see it?
Throw it in the oven.
, :
NO!
, :
NO!
They're like Early American x-ray specs.
Benjamin Franklin invented something like these.
Uh, I think he invented *these*.
I lost my feed.
What?
I lost my feed, Ben. I don't know where anyone is. I have nothing. Ben, I have nothing. Get out of there. Get out of there now!
I'm taking the whole thing. I'll get it out of the elevator.
What are you taking... Is it heavy?
Riley, can you hear me?
Unfortunately, yeah.
Meet me at the car. Call me if you have any problems.
Like if we get caught and killed?
Yeah - that would be a big problem. Take care of her.
, :

I will.
, :

I will.
Anyone crazy enough to believe us isn't gonna want to help.
We don't need someone crazy. But one step short of crazy, what do you get?
Obsessed.
Passionate.
Oh, no.
Holy Lord.
Ian, why don't you just come back down here, and we can talk through this together!
Don't speak again.
Okay.
Is that that hot girl? How does she look?
Prison.
Albuquerque. See, I can do it too. Snorkel.
That's where the map is. Like he said, ""Fifty-five in iron pen."" ""Iron pen"" is a prison.
Or it could be, since the primary writing medium of the time was iron gall ink, the ""pen"" is... just a pen. But then why not say a pen? Why say ""iron pen""?
Cause it's a prison.
Where are you?
Stop talking. Start the van.
Ben, the, uh, mean D- Declaration lady is behind you.
Skidding! Skidding! Skidding!
Will someone please explain to me what these magic numbers are?
Who's the stiff?
Stop chatting and get in the van.
... We probably have our own satellite by now..."
David Lightman,BA,Playful Hacker,"The whole point was to find a way to practice nuclear war without destroying ourselves. To get the computers to learn from mistakes we couldn't afford to make. Except, I never could get Joshua to learn the most important lesson.
What's that?
Futility. That there's a time when you should just give up.
What kind of a lesson is that?
Did you ever play tic-tac-toe?
Yeah, of course.
But you don't anymore.
No.
Why?
Because it's a boring game. It's always a tie.
Exactly. There's no way to win. The game itself is pointless! But back at the war room, they believe you can win a nuclear war. That there can be ""acceptable losses.""
Shall we play a game?
Oh!
I think it missed him.
Yeah. Weird isn't it?
Yeah.
Love to. How about Global Thermonuclear War?
Wouldn't you prefer a nice game of chess?
Later. Let's play Global Thermonuclear War.
Fine.
Now there seems to be a lot of confusion on this next question: asexual reproduction. Could someone tell me please who first suggested the idea of reproduction without sex?
Ah-heh.

Miss Mack! What is so amusing?
I...
Alright, Lightman. Maybe you could tell us who first suggested the idea of reproduction without sex.
Umm... Your wife?
Get out, Lightman. Get out.
What is the primary goal?
You should know, Professor. You programmed me.
Oh, come on.
What is the primary goal?
To win the game.
He wasn't very old.
No, he was pretty old. He was 41.
Oh yeah? Oh, that's old.
Joshua called me.
David, computers don't call people!
Yours did.
I think I saw one...
What kind of an asshole lives on an island and he doesn't even have a boat?
Maybe we can swim for it. How far do you think it is?
No. It's uh, two, three miles at least. Maybe more.
Well, what do you say? Let's go for it!
No.
Come on!
No!
I can't swim.
You can't swim?
No, I can't, okay? Wonder Woman, I can't swim!
Well, what kind of an asshole grows up in Seattle and doesn't even know how to swim?
I never got around to it, okay? I always thought there was gonna be plenty of time!
Sorry.
I wish I didn't know about any of this! I wish I was like everybody else in the world, and tomorrow it would just be over. There wouldn't be any time to be sorry... about anything.
Oh, Jesus! I really wanted to learn how to swim! I swear to God I did.
What is it doing?
It's learning.
People sometimes make mistakes.
Yes, they do.
See that sign up here - up here. ""Defcon."" That indicates our current defense condition. It should read ""Defcon 5,"" which means peace. It's still on 4 because of that little stunt you pulled. Actually, if we hadn't caught it in time, it might have gone to Defcon 1. You know what that means, David?
No. What does that mean?
World War Three.
Is this a game... or is it real?
What's the difference?
Oh wow.
You are a hard man to reach. Could not find you in Seattle and no terminal is in operation at your classified address.
What classified address?
D.O.D. pension files indicate current mailing as: Dr. Robert Hume, a.k.a. Stephen W. Falken, 5 Tall Cedar Road, Goose Island, Oregon 97...
Come on. Learn, goddammit.
Hey, I don't believe that any system is totally secure.
So what, do you think you kids own this place?
Oh, I was, uh, I was- I was just looking around.
You know you're not supposed to leave the group, don't you?
Yes.
So why don't you get back there!
OK. Excuse me.
Go on.
Thank you very much, sir.
This is unreal! You don't care about death 'cause you're already dead! I know a lot about you. I know you weren't always like this. What was the last thing you cared about?
Which side do you want?
I'll be the Russians.
What he did was great! He designed his computer so that it could learn from its own mistakes. So, they'd be better the next time they played. The system actually learned how to learn. It could teach itself!
People sometimes make mistakes.
Yes. They do.
David, are you watching the news?
Jennifer, yeah, I'm watching.
David, is that us on TV? Did we do that?
It. could be. Oh, Jesus, Jennifer, what am I gonna do? They're going to come get me. I'm really screwed! I am screwed!
Hello, are you still playing the game?
Of course. I should reach Defcon 1 and release my missiles in 28 hours. Would you like to see some projected kill ratios?
69% of the housing destroyed. 72 million people dead.
Is this a game or is it real?
What's the difference?"
Mr. Universe,BA,Playful Hacker,"Can't stop the signal, Mal. Everything goes somewhere, and I go everywhere.
You guys always bring me the very best violence.
And, she falls asleep. Which, she would be sleepy.
Can you go back? See if anybody spoke with her before she acted up... made any kind of contact with her.
Miranda...
Miranda? Go back further.
No...
Uh... please?
Oh, Mal, you're very smart. Someone is talking to her.
The Oaty Bar?
Subliminal. It's a subliminal message, broadwaved to trigger her.
I've been seeing this code pop up all over, the last few weeks. It's Alliance, and it's high military.
They have gone to enormous trouble to find your little friend... and found her they have. Do you all know what it is you're carrying?
I cried like a baby, a hungry, angry baby.
There is no news. There is only the truth of the signal. What I see. And, there's the puppet theater the Parliament jesters foist on the somnambulant public.
From here to the eyes and the ears of the 'Verse, that's my motto, or it might be if I start having a motto."
Chris Knight,O,Child Prodigy,"You know, um, something strange happened to me this morning...
Was it a dream where you see yourself standing in sort of sun-god robes on a pyramid with a thousand naked women screaming and throwing little pickles at you?
No...
Why am I the only one who has that dream?
What are you doing?
Self-realization. I was thinking of the immortal words of Socrates, who said, ""... I drank what?""
Do you mind if I name my first child after you? ""Dipshit Knight"" has a nice ring to it.
So, if there's anything I can do for you - or, more to the point, *to* you - just let me know.
Can you hammer a six-inch spike through a board with your penis?
Not right now.
A girl's gotta have her standards.
Have you ever seen a body like this before in your life?
She happens to be my daughter.
Oh. Then I guess you have.
When you first started at Pacific Tech you were well on your way to becoming another Einstein and then you know what happened?
I got a haircut?
But if I stay, what should I do?
You get even with Kent. It's a moral imperative.
This? This is ice. This is what happens to water when it gets too cold. This? This is Kent. This is what happens to people when they get too sexually frustrated.
You're all a bunch of degenerates.
*We* are? What about that time I found you naked with that bowl of Jell-O?
You did not.
This is true.
Look, it was hot and I was hungry, okay?
Here Mitch, taste this. Go on, you won't hurt my feelings, just try it. What do you think, too sweet?
What is it?
I don't know, I found it in one of the labs.
Relax, it's just yogurt.
Sir, let me take this moment to compliment you on your fashion sense, particularly your slippers.
Moles and trolls, moles and trolls, work, work, work, work, work. We never see the light of day. We plan this thing for weeks and all they want to do is study. I'm disgusted. I'm sorry but it's not like me, I'm depressed. There was what, no one at the mutant hamster races, we only had one entry into the Madame Curie look-alike contest and he was disqualified later. Why do I bother?
Look at it this way. Considering the type of people you are and the environment you're in, you have to admit the strong possibility this may be the only chance you ever have in your entire lives... to have sex.
What's that smell?
Must be the dog, sir.
That's popcorn.
Yes sir, I know...
Well, get it away from me! I hate popcorn! I can't stand popcorn!
Good. Now I know what to get you for your birthday.
Okay Mitch, I'm gonna make it up to you. Let's just pause, put that down. Let's just take a step back. No, I was wrong, I'm sorry, take a step forward. Now, take a step back. Step forward. Back. And then we're cha-cha-ing!
Will you stop it? I'm serious!
Okay, I'm serious too!
I want to see more of you around the lab.
Fine. I'll gain weight.
Do you think it's getting weird around here?
Absolutely.
I didn't notice.
I like it.
Hey Kent... That's your car.
Kent, you know you're not supposed to park that on campus.
You've gone too far this time, Knight.
I had help!
You, huh? Well you won't get away with this. Doctor Hathaway's gonna hear all about this. You'll rue the day!
""Rue the day?"" Who talks like that?
Well, how'd you do?
How'd I do? I passed! But I failed! Yeah!
Well, then I'm happy and sad for you.
And I suppose you're in on this too. Did you make this stuff?
I'm not saying.
Well who's gonna clean it up?
You won't have to. It's gonna go from solid form directly to gas.
Whoa! Really? What is it?
I'm not sayin', but I can tell you it's fairly rare and very unstable.
Just like you.
Why is that toy on your head?
Because if I wear it any place else, it chafes.
You see Mitch, I used to be you. And lately I've been missing me so I asked Dr. Hathaway if I could room with me again and he said sure.
Hey how's it going, Jerry?
What do you want, Knight?
World peace, but I don't think this is the time to discuss it.
Get out!
There's something that might interest you, Jerry.
I'm not interested in anything you have to say.
Dr. Hathaway...
Susan!
I solved the power problem, Jerry.
Jerry?
Take a cab.
So you'll hammer later!
Don't eat that!
Why?
Don't you know that eating that stuff can give you very large breasts?
Oh, my God! I'm too late!
Did you know there's a guy living in our closet?
You've seen him too?
Who is he?
Hollyfeld.
Why does he keep going into our closet?
Why do you keep going into our closet?
To get my clothes - but that's not why he goes in there.
Of course not, he's twice your size - your clothes would never fit him.
Yeah...
Think before you ask these questions, Mitch. Twenty points higher than me? Thinks a big guy like that can wear his clothes?
As you know, Mitch and I were working on the cyanide system. Well, earlier today it ate itself. But, these little set-backs are just what we need to take a giant step forward. Right, Kent? Needless to say, I was a little despondent about the melt down, but then, in the midst of my preparations for hari kiri, it came to me. It is possible to synthesize excited bromide in an argon matrix. Yes, it's an excimer frozen in its excited state.
Th... That's impossible.
It's a chemical laser but in solid, not gaseous, form. Put simply, in deference to you, Kent, it's like lasing a stick of dynamite. As soon as we apply a field, we couple to a state that is radiatively coupled to the ground state. I figure we can extract at least ten to the twenty-first photons per cubic centimeter which will give one kilojoule per cubic centimeter at 600 nanometers, or, one megajoule per liter.
You didn't touch anything, did you?
No.
Good. Because all of my filth is arranged in alphabetical order. This, for instance, is under 'H' for ""toy.""
What is it?
It's a penis stretcher. Do you want to try it?
No!
I'm just kidding. It's yet another in a long series of diversions in an attempt to avoid responsibility.
Oh, Kent, that is so unfair! And we were going to make you King of the Winter Carnival.
Really?
If you want to leave, go ahead. But, uh... you're going to miss the fun.
What fun?
Ick invented a new virus and we're going to release it in Kent's room.
Kent puts his name on his license plate.
My mom does the same thing to my underwear.
Your mom puts license plates in your underwear? How do you sit?
You still run?
Only when chased.
Jerry, if you think that by threatening me you can get me to be your slave... Well, that's where you're right. But - and I am only saying this because I care - there are a lot of decaffeinated brands on the market today that are just as tasty as the real thing.
I'm not kidding, Chris.
Neither am I, Jerry.
Would you qualify that as a launch problem or a design problem?
It worked!
That's neat!
Now if we can just keep it from exploding!
Explo-?
Hey Ick, you were just kidding about exploding, right?
Ick? It's a joke, right?
You are of no further use to me!
Interesting way to begin a conversation...
He lied to us.
It's easy to lie to you, Mitch. You trust people. I'm a cynic.
Welcome to Pacific Tech's ""Smart People on Ice"".
You unbelievable bastard.
Count on it.
I'm sorry. It's just that I didn't want you guys to think I was stuffy. You know, no fun. All brain, no penis.
You *are* Chris Knight, aren't you?
I hope so. I'm wearing his underwear.
How do these look?
Terrible - mine looks like him and his looks like me.
Uh, I'll catch up with you guys. I have to go to the bathroom.
Okay, Kent, but I don't think that's going to help your confidence any, do you?
IDs?
Hey, could you snap it up buddy, we just flew in, we're tired, we're hungry, we rented this stupid car...
Are you out of your mind?
Shh. We've got to intimidate these guys. Be cool. It's okay.
You're not on the list.
List. We're not on the list. Yeah, that's because we're classified.
Yeah.
Security. Yes, sir.
Aren't you guys a little young to be technicians?
Yeah, well, lasers are a young science... okay, there, fine, you made me say it. Now we're both in trouble!
Look, I'll call the duty officer.
Uh.
Hey, uh, there, uh, airborne!
Don't do that. Listen, if you make that call it's our job: we're four hours late. Give us a break, will ya' buddy? Someday you might be in the private sector too, right?
Yeah.
We're dead.
Oh, no.
All right!
What if these don't fool anybody?
They shoot us.
You wanted to see me, Your Joggingness?
Would you prepared if gravity reversed itself? The only thing I can't figure out is how to keep the change in my pockets. I've got it. Nudity."

God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables; slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need. We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed off.
It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything.

No, it is not. How much can you know about yourself, you've never been in a fight? I don't wanna die without any scars. So come on; hit me before I lose my nerve.
This is crazy.
So go crazy. Let 'er rip.
I don't know about this.
I don't either. Who gives a shit? No one's watching. What do you care?
Whoa, wait, this is crazy. You want me to hit you?
That's right.
What, like in the face?
Surprise me.
This is so fucking stupid...
Motherfucker! You hit me in the ear!
Well, Jesus, I'm sorry.
Ow, Christ... why the ear, man?
Guess I fucked it up...
No, that was perfect!
You know why they put oxygen masks on planes?
So you can breathe.
Oxygen gets you high. In a catastrophic emergency, you're taking giant panicked breaths. Suddenly you become euphoric, docile. You accept your fate. It's all right here. Emergency water landing - 600 miles an hour. Blank faces, calm as Hindu cows.
That's, um... That's an interesting theory.
Hey, you created me. I didn't create some loser alter-ego to make myself feel better. Take some responsibility!
Fuck damnation, man! Fuck redemption! We are God's unwanted children? So be it!
OK. Give me some water!
Listen, you can run water over your hand and make it worse or...
Look at me... or you can use vinegar and neutralize the burn.
Please let me have it... *Please*!
First you have to give up, first you have to *know*... not fear... *know*... that someday you're gonna die.
Sticking feathers up your butt does not make you a chicken.
We're a generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need.
The first soap was made from heroes' ashes, like the first monkey shot into space.Without pain, without sacrifice, we would have nothing. Like the first monkey shot into space.
It could be worse. A woman could cut off your penis while you're sleeping and toss it out the window of a moving car.
There's always that.
I am Jack's colon.
I get cancer, I kill Jack.
Tyler, what the fuck is going on here?
I ask you for one thing, one simple thing.
Why do people think that I'm you? Answer me!
Sit.
Now answer me, why do people think that I'm you.
I think you know.
No, I don't.
Yes, you do. Why would anyone possibly confuse you with me?
Uh... I... I don't know.
You got it.
No.
Say it.
Because...
Say it.
Because we're the same person.
That's right.
Oh, it's late. Hey, thanks for the beer.
Yeah, man.
I should find a hotel.
What?
What?
A hotel?
Yeah.
Just ask, man.
What are you talking about?
Three pitchers of beer, and you still can't ask.
What?
You call me because you need a place to stay.
Oh, hey, no, no, no, I didn't mean...
Yes, you did. So just ask. Cut the foreplay and just ask.
Would - would that be a problem?
Is it a problem for you to ask?
Can I stay at your place?
Yeah.
WHOA! WHOA! WHOA! Ok, you are now firing a gun at your 'imaginary friend' near 400 GALLONS OF NITROGLYCERINE!
Shut up! Our fathers were our models for God. If our fathers bailed, what does that tell you about God?
No, no, I... don't...
Listen to me! You have to consider the possibility that God does not like you. He never wanted you. In all probability, he hates you. This is not the worst thing that can happen.
It isn't?
We don't need him!
Do you know what a duvet is?
It's a comforter...
It's a blanket. Just a blanket. Now why do guys like you and me know what a duvet is? Is this essential to our survival, in the hunter-gatherer sense of the word? No. What are we then?
...Consumers?
Right. We are consumers. We're the by-products of a lifestyle obsession.
Bob is dead, they shot him in the head!
You wanna make an omelet, you gotta break some eggs.
Fuck off with your sofa units and strine green stripe patterns, I say never be complete, I say stop being perfect, I say let... lets evolve, let the chips fall where they may.
Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day of Raymond K. Hessel's life. His breakfast will taste better than any meal you and I have ever tasted.
Where'd you go, psycho boy?
I felt like destroying something beautiful.
This is crazy...
People do it everyday, they talk to themselves... they see themselves as they'd like to be, they don't have the courage you have, to just run with it.
What do you do for a living?
Why? So you can pretend like you're interested?
This isn't love, it's sport fucking.
Do you hear me now?
No, I didn't quite catch that, Lou.
Still not getting it.
Okay, I got it. Shit, I lost it.
My dad never went to college, so it was real important that I go.
Sounds familiar.
So I graduate, I call him up long distance, I say ""Dad, now what?"" He says, ""Get a job.""
Same here.
Now I'm 25, make my yearly call again. I say Dad, ""Now what?"" He says, ""I don't know, get married.""
I can't get married, I'm a 30 year old boy.
We're a generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need.
What are you doing?
Guys, what would you wish you'd done before you died?
Paint a self-portrait.
Build a house.
And you?
I don't know. Turn the wheel now, come on!
You have to know the answer to this question! If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
I don't know, I wouldn't feel anything good about my life, is that what you want to hear me say? Fine. Come on!
Not good enough.
Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat. It's not a goddamn seminar. Stop trying to control everything and just let go! LET GO!
You don't know which wire to pull.
I know everything you do, so if you know I know.
Or maybe, since I knew you'd know I spent all days thinking about the wrong wires.
Hi. You're going to call off your rigorous investigation. You're going to publicly state that there is no underground group. Or... these guys are going to take your balls. They're going to send one to the New York Times, one to the LA Times press-release style. Look, the people you are after are the people you depend on. We cook your meals, we haul your trash, we connect your calls, we drive your ambulances. We guard you while you sleep. Do not... fuck with us.
Tyler, I'm grateful to you; for everything that you've done for me. But this is too much. I don't want this.
What do you want? Wanna go back to the shit job, fuckin' condo world, watching sitcoms? Fuck you, I won't do it.
Self improvement is masturbation. Now self destruction...
In the world I see - you are stalking elk through the damp canyon forests around the ruins of Rockefeller Center. You'll wear leather clothes that will last you the rest of your life. You'll climb the wrist-thick kudzu vines that wrap the Sears Tower. And when you look down, you'll see tiny figures pounding corn, laying strips of venison on the empty car pool lane of some abandoned superhighway.
I look around, I look around, I see a lot of new faces.
Shut up. Which means a lot of you have been breaking the first two rules of Fight Club.
Fuck what you know. You need to forget about what you know, that's your problem. Forget about what you think you know about life, about friendship, and especially about you and me.
You have a kind of sick desperation in your laugh.
OK: any historic figure.
I'd fight Gandhi.
Good answer.
How about you?
Lincoln.
Lincoln?
Big guy, big reach. Skinny guys fight 'til they're burger.
I'll bring us through this. As always. I'll carry you - kicking and screaming - and in the end you'll thank me.
Reject the basic assumptions of civilization, especially the importance of material possessions.
All the ways you wish you could be, that's me. I look like you wanna look, I fuck like you wanna fuck, I am smart, capable, and most importantly, I am free in all the ways that you are not.
This is your pain. This is your burning hand. It's right here. Look at it.
I'm going to my cave. I'm going to my cave and I'm going to find my power animal.
No! Don't deal with this the way those dead people do. Deal with it the way a living person does.
People are always asking me if I know Tyler Durden.
Three minutes. This is it - ground zero. Would you like to say a few words to mark the occasion?
...i... ann... iinn... ff... nnyin...
With a gun barrel between your teeth, you speak only in vowels.
I can't think of anything.
For a second I totally forgot about Tyler's whole controlled demolition thing and I wonder how clean that gun is.
We're consumers. We are by-products of a lifestyle obsession. Murder, crime, poverty, these things don't concern me. What concerns me are celebrity magazines, television with 500 channels, some guy's name on my underwear. Rogaine, Viagra, Olestra.
Martha Stewart.
Fuck Martha Stewart. Martha's polishing the brass on the Titanic. It's all going down, man. So fuck off with your sofa units and Strinne green stripe patterns.
Tyler was a night person. While the rest of us were sleeping, he worked. He had one part time job as a projectionist. See, a movie doesn't come all on one big reel. It comes on a few. So someone has to be there to switch the projectors at the exact moment that one reel ends and the next one begins. If you look for it, you can see these little dots come into the upper right-hand corner of the screen.
In the industry, we call them ""cigarette burns.""
That's the cue for a changeover. He flips the projectors, the movie keeps right on going, and nobody in the audience has any idea.
Why would anyone want this shit job?
Because it affords him other interesting opportunities.
Like splicing single frames of pornography into family films.
You're insane.
No, you're insane.
Did you know that if you mix equal parts of gasoline and frozen orange juice concentrate you can make napalm?
No, I did not know that; is that true?
That's right... One could make all kinds of explosives, using simple household items.
Really...?
If one were so inclined.
Tyler, you are by far the most interesting single-serving friend I've ever met... see I have this thing: everything on a plane is single-serving...
Oh I get it, it's very clever.
Thank you.
How's that working out for you?
What?
Being clever.
Great.
Keep it up then... Right up.
Now a question of etiquette; as I pass, do I give you the ass or the crotch...?
Fight Club was the beginning, now it's moved out of the basement, it's called Project Mayhem.
We are all part of the same compost heap.
Now, ancient people found their clothes got cleaner if they washed them at a certain spot in the river. You know why?
No.
Human sacrifices were once made on the hills above this river. Bodies burnt, water speeded through the wood ashes to create lye.
This is lye - the crucial ingredient. The lye combined with the melted fat of the bodies, till a thick white soapy discharge crept into the river. May I see your hand, please?
What is this?
This...
... is chemical burn.
All right, if the applicant is young, tell him he's too young. Old, too old. Fat, too fat. If the applicant then waits for three days without food, shelter, or encouragement he may then enter and begin his training.
God Damn! We just had a near-life experience, fellas.
Would you like to say a few words to mark the occasion?
mumbles...
I'm sorry...
I still can't think of anything.
Ah... flashback humor.
Is that what a man looks like?
Self-improvement is masturbation. Now self-destruction...
You don't know where I've been. You don't know where I've been. Just let us have the basement, Lou!
Tell him. Tell him, The liberator who destroyed my property has realigned my perceptions.
She's a predator posing as a house pet.
Now why would you want to go and blow your head off?
Not my head, Tyler, *our* head.
The salt balance has to be just right, so the best fat for making soap comes from humans.
Wait. What is this place?
A liposuction clinic.
You're fucking Marla, Tyler.
Uh, technically, you're fucking Marla, but it's all the same to her.
If you could fight anyone, who would you fight?
I'd fight my boss, prob'ly.
Really.
Yeah, why, who would you fight?
I'd fight my dad.
I don't know my dad. I mean, I know him, but... he left when I was like six years old. Married this other woman, had some other kids. He like did this every six years, he goes to a new city and starts a new family.
Fucker's setting up franchises.
I had it all. I had a stereo that was very decent, a wardrobe that was getting very respectable. I was close to being complete.
Shit man, now it's all gone.
What do you do?
What do you mean?
What do you do for a living?
Why? So you can pretend like you're interested?
I want you to listen to me very carefully, Tyler.
Okay...
My eyes are open.
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
What do you want me to do? You want me to hit you?
Come on, do me this one favor.
Why?
Why? I don't know why, I don't know. Never been in a fight, you?
No, but that's a good thing.
No, man it's not. How much can you know yourself if you've never been in a fight? I don't wanna die with out any scars.
*slaps the Narrator, throws away goggles* Listen to me! You have to consider the possibility that God does not like you, never wanted you, and in all probability, he HATES you. It's not the worst thing that can happen.
It isn't?
We don't NEED Him!
*squirms* We don't - we don't - !
Fuck damnation, man! Fuck redemption! We're God's unwanted children, SO BE IT!
You're too old, fat man. Your tits are too big.
Get the fuck off my porch.
What are we doing tonight?
Tonight? We make soap.
Really.
To make soap, first we render fat.
WHOA! WHOA! OK, you are now firing a gun at your imaginary friend NEAR 400 GALLONS OF NITROGLYCERIN!
Like a monkey, ready to be shot into space. Space monkey! Ready to sacrifice himself for the greater good.
From now on, all those with shaved heads: ""Space Monkeys"".
So when the snooty cat, and the courageous dog, with the celebrity voices meet for the first time in reel three, that's when you'll catch a flash of Tyler's contribution to the film.
Nobody knows that they saw it, but they did...
A nice, big cock...
Even a hummingbird couldn't catch Tyler at work.
The richest, creamiest fat in the world. The fat of the land.
...If you don't claim your humanity you will become a statistic. You have been warned
It's getting exciting now, two and one-half. Think of everything we've accomplished, man. Out these windows, we will view the collapse of financial history. One step closer to economic equilibrium.
Fuck.
Hey, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart.
Hello?
Who is this?
Tyler?
Who is this?
Uh... we met... we met on the airplane. We had the same suitcase. Uh... the clever guy?
Oh yeah, right.
Ok?
I called a second ago, th - there was no answer, I'm at the payphone...
yeah, I *69ed you, I never pick up my phone.
So what's up, huh?
Uh, well... You're not gonna believe this...
Just tell him you fuckin' did it. Tell him you blew it all up. That's what he wants to hear.
What's that smell?
Something on your mind, dear?
Man, you've got some fucked up friends, I'm tellin' ya. Limber, though...
Why wasn't I told about Project Mayhem?
What are you talking about?
Why didn't you include me, in the beginning?
Fight Club *was* the beginning.
If you could fight any celebrity, who would you fight?
Alive or dead?
Doesn't matter. Who'd be tough?
Hemingway. You?
Shatner. I'd fight William Shatner.
*punches Tyler in face* You here me now?
Alright, alright, I got it. I got it - shit I lost it.
No, you have a house.
Rented in your name.
You have jobs! You have a whole life!
You have night jobs because you can't sleep. Why do you stay up and make soap?
Marla. You're fucking Marla, Tyler.
Ah technically *you're* fucking Marla, but it's all the same to her.
Oh my God.
Well you did lose a lot of versatile solutions for modern living
This is a chemical burn. It will hurt more than you've ever been burned before. You will have a scar.
He was *the* guerilla terrorist in the food service industry.
Do not watch. I cannot go when you watch.
Apart from seasoning the lobster bisque, he farted on the meringue, sneezed on braised endive, and as for the cream of mushroom soup, well...
Go ahead. Tell 'em.
...you get the idea."
Mr. Nick,BQ,Trickster,"You can't stop a story being told.
That's a weak hypothesis.
Damn. I won.
Shit.
I'll kill you you son of a bitch.
Now that I'd like to see.
You're probably not a betting man are you?
It's been a while.
I don't suppose you're a... betting man, are ya Doc?"
Sam Spade,AN,Hardboiled Detective,"Heavy. What is it?
The, uh, stuff that dreams are made of.
Huh?
When you're slapped, you'll take it and like it.
You're a good man, sister.
You're a close-mouthed man?
Nah, I like to talk.
Better and better. I distrust a close-mouthed man. He generally picks the wrong time to talk and says the wrong things. Talking's something you can't do judiciously, unless you keep in practice.
Now, sir. We'll talk, if you like. I'll tell you right out, I am a man who likes talking to a man who likes to talk.
Swell. Will we talk about the black bird?
I hope they don't hang you, precious, by that sweet neck. Yes, angel, I'm gonna send you over. The chances are you'll get off with life. That means if you're a good girl, you'll be out in 20 years. I'll be waiting for you. If they hang you, I'll always remember you.
Keep on riding me and they're gonna be picking iron out of your liver.
The cheaper the crook, the gaudier the patter.
Haven't you tried to buy my loyalty with money and nothing else?
What else is there I can buy you with?
You always have a very smooth explanation ready.
What do you want me to do, learn to stutter?
I haven't lived a good life. I've been bad, worse than you could know.
You know, that's good, because if you actually were as innocent as you pretend to be, we'd never get anywhere.
Who killed Thursby?
I don't know.
Perhaps you don't, but you could make an excellent guess.
My guess might be excellent or it might be crummy, but Mrs. Spade didn't raise any children dippy enough to make guesses in front of a district attorney, and an assistant district attorney and a stenographer.
Why shouldn't you, if you have nothing to conceal?
Everybody has something to conceal.
I'm a sworn officer of the law, 24 hours a day, and neither formality nor informality justifies you withholding evidence of crime from me. Except, of course, on constitutional grounds.
Now, both you and the police have as much as accused me of being mixed up in the other night's murders. Well, I've had trouble with both of you before. And as far as I can see my best chance of clearing myself of the trouble you're trying to make for me, is by bringing in the murderers all tied up. And the only chance I've got of catching them, and tying them up, and bringing them in, is by staying as far away as possible from you and the police, because you'd only gum up the works.
You getting this all right, son, or am I goin' too fast for ya?
No, sir, I'm getting it all right.
Good work.
Mr. Archer was so alive yesterday, so solid and hearty...
Stop it. He knew what he was doing. Those are the chances we take.
Was he married?
Yeah, with ten thousand insurance, no children, and a wife that didn't like him.
Yes, sweetheart?
There's a girl wants to see you. Her name's Wonderly.
Customer?
I guess so. You'll want to see her anyway. She's a knockout.
Shoo her in, Effie darling, shoo her in.
He has a wife and three children in England.
They usually do, though not always in England.
You're good. You're very good.
Help me.
You won't need much of anybody's help. You're good. Chiefly your eyes, I think, and that throb you get in your voice when you say things like 'Be generous, Mr. Spade.'
I deserve that. But the lie was in the way I said it, not at all in what I said. It's my own fault if you can't believe me now.
Ah, now you are dangerous.
All we've got is that maybe you love me and maybe I love you.
You know whether you love me or not.
Maybe I do. I'll have some rotten nights after I've sent you over, but that'll pass.
Ten thousand? We were talking about a lot more money than this.
Yes, sir, we were, but this is genuine coin of the realm. With a dollar of this, you can buy ten dollars of talk.
Now, let's *talk* about the black bird.
Let's. Mr. Spade, have you any conception of how much money can be got for that black bird?
No.
Well, sir, if I told you... If I told you *half*... you'd call me a liar.
No, not even if I thought so.
I certainly wish you would have invented a more reasonable story. I felt distinctly like an idiot repeating it.
Don't worry about the story's goofiness. A sensible one would have had us all in the cooler.
You're a good man, sister.
This'll put you in solid with your boss.
Don't be too sure I'm as crooked as I'm supposed to be.
If you kill me, how are you going get the bird? And if I know you can't afford to kill me, how are you going to scare me into giving it to you?
Well, sir, there are other means of persuasion besides killing and threatening to kill.
Yes, that's... That's true. But, there're none of them any good unless the threat of death is behind them. You see what I mean? If you start something, I'll make it a matter of your having to kill me or call it off.
That's an attitude, sir, that calls for the most delicate judgment on both sides. Because, as you know, sir, in the heat of action men are likely to forget where their best interests lie and let their emotions carry them away.
Then the trick from my angle is to make my play strong enough to tie you up, but not make you mad enough to bump me off against your better judgment.
By gad, sir, you are a character.
I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble.
If you kill me, how are you gonna get the bird? And if I know you can't afford to kill me, how are you gonna scare me into giving it to you?
You killed Miles and you're going over for it.
I do know he always went heavily armed, and that he never went to sleep without covering the floor around his bed with crumpled newspapers, so that nobody could come silently into his room.
You picked a nice sort of a playmate.
Only that sort could have helped me, if he'd been loyal.
I am prepared to pay five thousand dollars for the figure's return. Do you have it?
No.
But if it isn't here, why did you risk serious injury to prevent my searching for it?
Why should I sit around here and let people come in and stick me up?
But certainly it is only natural that I try to save the owner such a considerable expense if possible.
Haven't you anything better to do than to keep popping in here early every morning and asking a lot of fool questions?
And gettin' a lot of lyin' answers!
Take it easy.
Here.
You shouldn't let him go around with these on him, he might get himself hurt.
Well, well, what's this?
A crippled newsie took 'em away from him. I made him give 'em back.
People lose teeth talking like that. If you want to hang around, you'll be polite.
You gotta convince me that you know what this is all about, that you aren't just fiddling around hoping it'll all... come out right in the end!
You don't have to trust me as long as you can persuade me to trust you.
Keep askin' for it and you're gonna get it... plenty. I told you to shove off... shove off.
People lose teeth talkin' like that. You wanna hang around, you'll be polite.
Well you know me Spade, if you did it or if you didn't, you'll get a square deal from me and most of the breaks. Don't know as I'd blame you much - man that killed your partner. But that won't stop me from nailing ya.
Fair enough
This is going to be the most astounding thing you have ever heard of, sir, and I say that knowing that a man of your caliber, in your profession, must have known some astounding things in his time. What do you know, sir, about the Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem, later known as the Knights of Rhodes and other things?
Crusaders or something, weren't they?
Very good. In 1539, these crusading knights persuaded the Emperor Charles V to give them the island of Malta. He made them but one condition: They were to pay him, each year, the tribute of one falcon, in acknowledgment that Malta was still under Spain. Do you have any conception of the extreme, the immeasurable wealth of the Order at that time?
I imagine they were pretty well fixed
Pretty well is putting it mildly. They were rolling in wealth, sir. For years they had taken from the East, nobody knows what spoils of gems, of precious metals, silks, ivories, sir. We all know that the Holy Wars were to them largely a matter of loot. The Knights were profoundly grateful to the Emperor Charles for his generosity toward them. They hit upon the happy thought of sending him for the first year's tribute, not an insignificant live bird, but a glorious golden falcon, encrusted from head to feet with the finest jewels in their coffers. Well, sir, what do you think of that?
I don't know.
These are facts, sir. Not school book history, not Mr. Wells's history, but history nevertheless. They sent this foot-high jeweled bird to Charles, who was then in Spain. They sent it in a galley commanded by a member of the Order. It never reached Spain. A famous admiral of buccaneers took the Knight's galley and the bird. In 1713 it turned up in Sicily. In 1840 it appeared in Paris. It had by then acquired a coat of black enamel so that it looked like nothing more than a fairly interesting black statuette. In that disguise, sir, it was, you might say, kicked around Paris for more than three score years, by private owners too stupid to see what it was under the skin... Then in 1923, a Greek dealer named Charilaos Konstantinides found it in an obscure shop. No thickness of enamel could conceal value from his eyes. You begin to believe me a little?
You begin to believe me a little?
I haven't said I didn't.
Well, sir, to hold it safe while pursuing his researches into its history, Charliaos re-enameled the bird. Despite that precaution, I got wind of his find. Ah, sir, if only I had known a few days sooner. I was in London when I heard. I packed a bag and took the boat train immediately. On the train I opened a paper, The Times, and read that Charilaos' establishment had been burglarized and him murdered. Sure enough, I discovered upon arriving there that the bird was gone. That was seventeen years ago. Well, sir, it took me seventeen years to locate that bird, but I did. I wanted it and I'm not a man that's easily discouraged when I want something. I traced it to the home of a Russian general - one Kemidov - in an Istanbul suburb. He didn't know a thing about it. It was nothing but a black enameled figure to him, but his natural contrariness kept him from selling it to me when I made him an offer. So I sent some - ah - agents to get it. Well, sir, they got it, and I haven't got it. But I'm going to get it... Your glass, sir.
Then the bird doesn't belong to any of you but to a General Kemidov?
Well, sir, you might say it belonged to the King of Spain, but I don't see how you can honestly grant anybody else clear title to it - except by right of possession. Well, now, before we start to talk prices, how soon can you - or how soon are you willing to produce the Falcon?
There isn't the time for that schoolgirl act! We're both of us sitting under the gallows!"
Philip Marlowe,AN,Hardboiled Detective,"She tried to sit in my lap while I was standing up.
My, my, my! Such a lot of guns around town and so few brains! You know, you're the second guy I've met today that seems to think a gat in the hand means the world by the tail.
You're not very tall are you?
Well, I, uh, I try to be.
Convenient, the door being open when you didn't have a key, eh?
Yeah, wasn't it. By the way, how'd you happen to have one?
Is that any of your business?
I could make it my business.
I could make your business mine.
Oh, you wouldn't like it. The pay's too small.
How do you like your brandy, sir?
In a glass.
If you can use me again sometime, call this number.
Day and night?
Uh, night's better. I work during the day.
Is he as cute as you are?
Nobody is.
You've forgotten one thing - me.
What's wrong with you?
Nothing you can't fix.
What will your first step be?
The usual one.
I didn't know there was a usual one.
Well, sure there is. It comes complete with diagrams on page 47 of 'How to be a Detective in 10 Easy Lessons' correspondent school textbook and, uh, your father offered me a drink.
You must've read another one on how to be a comedian.
You're cute.
I'm getting cuter every minute.
Do you like orchids?
Not particularly.
Ugh. Nasty things. Their flesh is too much like the flesh of men, and their perfume has the rotten sweetness of corruption.
So you're a private detective. I didn't know they existed, except in books, or else they were greasy little men snooping around hotel corridors. My, you're a mess, aren't you?
I'm not very tall either. Next time I'll come on stilts wear a white tie and carry a tennis racket.
I doubt if even that will help.
You're cute. I like you.
Yeah, what you sees nothing, I got a Balinese dancing girl tattooed across my chest.
Are you attempting to tell me my duties, sir?
No, just having fun trying to guess what they are.
What can I do for you? I can do what? Where? Oh, no, I wouldn't like that. Neither would my daughter.
Get up, angel, you look like a Pekingese.
A half-smart guy, that's what I always draw. Never once a man who's smart all the way around the course. Never once.
I hurt you much, sugar?
You and every other man I've ever met.
Oh, Eddie, you don't have anybody watching me, do you? Tailing me in a gray Plymouth coupe, maybe?
No, why should I?
Well, I can't imagine, unless you're worried about where I am all the time.
I don't like you that well.
Thanks for the drink, General.
I enjoyed your drink as much as you did, sir.
Did I hurt you much, sugar?
You and every other man I've ever met.
How'd you happen to pick out this place?
Maybe I wanted to hold your hand.
Oh, that can be arranged.
You made a mistake. Mrs. Rutledge didn't want to see me.
I'm sorry, sir. I make many mistakes.
Hmm.
What does that mean?
It means, hmm.
Do you always think you can handle people like, uh, trained seals?
Uh-huh. I usually get away with it too.
How nice for you.
You do sell books, hmm?
What do those look like, grapefruit?
Well, from here they look like books.
You the guy that's been tailing me?
Yeah, the name's Jones. Harry Jones. I want to see you.
Swell. Did you want to see those guys jump me?
I didn't care one way or the other.
You could've yelled for help.
If a guy's playing a hand, I let him play it. I'm no kibitzer.
You got brains.
Is Harry there?
Yeah, yeah, he's here.
Put him on, will you?
He can't talk to you.
Why?
Because he's dead.
Well, so long, copper. Wish me luck. I got a raw deal.
Hey, your kind always does.
Somebody's always giving me guns.
You ought to wean her, she's old enough.
Don't you know any better than to wake a man up at two o'clock in the afternoon?
I know he was a good man at whatever he did. No one was more pleased than I when I heard you had taken him on as your... whatever he was.
I can do what? Where? Oh no, I wouldn't like that. Neither would my daughter.
I hope the sergeant never traces that call.
Your story didn't sound quite right.
Oh, that's too bad. You got a better one?
Maybe I can find one.
Let me do the talking, angel. I don't know yet what I'm going to tell them. It'll be pretty close to the truth.
I collect blondes and bottles too.
How bout a cup of coffee, Bernie?
Unh-uhh. I can't afford to be seen with you.
You knew him too?
Yes, in the old days, when he used to run rum out of Mexico and I was on the other side. We used to swap shots between drinks, or drinks between shots, whichever you like.
My respects to you, sir. Few men ever swapped more than one shot with Sean Regan.
You wanna tell me now?
Tell you what?
What it is you're trying to find out. You know, it's a funny thing. You're trying to find out what your father hired me to find out, and I'm trying to find out why you want to find out.
You could go on forever, couldn't you? Anyway it'll give us something to talk about next time we meet.
Among other things.
Bernie? This is Marlowe. I got some more red points for you.
Who is it this time?
Hello, let me talk to Mr. Mars.
This is Mars.
Oh, hello, Eddie. This is Marlowe.
Marlowe?
Yeah, Marlowe. Or, what's left of him.
""Good-bye, Mr Marlowe.""
""Well, it wasn't intentional.""
""Try it sometime."""
Dist. Atty. Martin Ferguson,AN,Hardboiled Detective,"Murder by profit!
You think you can shut people up by killing them, but you're wrong. Maybe not in the courtroom but they'll be talkin' to you, Mendoza! At night when you're trying to sleep!
C'mon, Miss Vetto. I want to see the look on Mendoza's face when he looks into those big blue eyes.
He's smiling at me...
Mendoza! Call them off! I'm not going into court! I swear I won't! Tell 'em! I'm not squealing! Please, tell 'em I'm not...
Rico! You're gonna talk! Do you hear me? You're gonna talk! You're not blowing up this case! It took four years to put him in that cell and when he walks out he's going to the chair. So you gonna talk, it's the only chance you got to live!
I'm afraid. He'll never die.
He'll die! He's got to die! And you're gonna kill him!
I can't! Nobody can! He ain't human.
What's wrong with the law that we can't touch him
? Oh, I know, our kind of laws are designed to protect the innocent. It's not enough we know a man is guilty - we have to prove it.
Ever have a tune running through your head and you can't remember the words?
What are you getting at?
How many people did we speak to on this case?
Oh, I'd hate to remember.
How many pages of testimony do you suppose we took?
Enough to fill a nice-sized room!
Heh, somewhere's in that testimony somebody said something that stuck in my brain. It got lost in the shuffle, because we didn't need it - we got Rico! But now...
If I could only remember...
Well, we got nothing else to do tonight - let's try and dig it out.
Well, we can start from right to left or from left to right.
No, let's take it just as it came to us, right from that first crazy day.
We could protect him against everything but himself.
How many bodies do you think we'll find?
Oh, afraid to guess. Any outfit that has got its own undertaker is operating on a pretty big scale."
Capt. 'Rip' Murdock,AN,Hardboiled Detective,"You know, the trouble with women is they ask too many questions. They should spend all their time just being beautiful.
And let the men do the worrying.
Yeah. You know, I've been thinking: women ought to come capsule-sized, about four inches high. When a man goes out of an evening, he just puts her in his pocket and takes her along with him, and that way he knows exactly where she is. He gets to his favorite restaurant, he puts her on the table and lets her run around among the coffee cups while he swaps a few lies with his pals...
Why...
Without danger of interruption. And when it comes that time of the evening when he wants her full-sized and beautiful, he just waves his hand and there she is, full-sized.
Why, that's the most conceited statement I've ever heard.
But if she starts to interrupt, he just shrinks her back to pocket-size and puts her away.
I understand. What you're saying is: women are made to be loved.
Is THAT what I'm saying?
Yes, it's a confession. A woman may drive you out of your mind, but you wouldn't trust her, and because you couldn't put her in your pocket, you get all mixed up.
You know, you do awful good. I came here to - but go ahead. Put Christmas in your eyes and keep your voice low. Tell me about paradise and all the things I'm missing. I haven't had a good laugh since before Johnny was murdered.
I hated every part of her but I couldn't figure her out yet. I wanted to see her the way Johnny had. I wanted to hear that song of hers with Johnny's ears. Maybe she was alright. And maybe Christmas comes in July. But I didn't believe it.
If I were you, I'd turn 'em in to Army Ordnance. You start coughin' too hard with one of them in your hand, there'll be nothing left but the gold in your teeth... if it don't melt!
I'm the brass-knuckles-in-the-teeth-to-dance-time type.
Say, when you get on again as a professor at some college, and I'm back running my cabs in St. Louis, send me up a problem in algebra once in a while, will you?
Blonde or brunette?
Redhead in a sloppy joe sweater.
I think you're a great guy, too, Rip, if that's what this conversation's about. Even in the U.S.A., this world.
Johnny, why don't you get rid of the grief you got for that blonde, whoever she is? Every mile we go, you sweat worse with the same pain. Didn't I tell you all females are the same with their faces washed?
Martinelli won't ever give up the gun. And this time you might get killed.
That would be awful. Wouldn't it?
Oh sorry, gorgeous. I didn't see what you look like. I'd let you have it, only it's long distance.
Captain Murdock?
On the hoof, son.
The camera boys'd like to get a couple of shots of you and Sergeant Drake. Could you come out on the platform? You only stop here for five minutes.
This is the City of Brotherly Love?
That's what New Yorkers call it. They don't live here.
I'm all for love, son.
Every mile we go you sweat worse with some pain. Didn't I tell you all females are the same with their faces washed?
Coming out of it was like after being tapped on the button. Everything foggy - fur in my throat, an anchor on my head, and ringing in my ears.
Whattya mean, am I checkin' up on you? Of course. I am. I forgot to tell you, I don't trust anybody - especially women!
I gather, Mr. Murdock, that you've been around, as the saying is?
East St. Louis is around enough.
Keep the motor running and the headlights on.
You're with me 'til after dark, and then some.
Here goes nothin, kid. Geronimo.
There's something about that big lug I didn't like. Maybe it's calling me friend."
Jeff Bailey,AN,Hardboiled Detective,"That's not the way to win.
Is there a way to win?
There's a way to lose more slowly.
I didn't know what I was doing. I, I didn't know anything except how much I hated him. But I didn't take anything. I didn't, Jeff. Don't you believe me?
Baby, I don't care.
She can't be all bad. No one is.
Well, she comes the closest.
I don't want to die.
Neither do I, baby, but if I have to, I'm going to die last.
Can't you even feel sorry for me?
I'm not going to try.
Jeff...
Just get out, will you? I have to sleep in this room.
I didn't know you were so little.
I'm taller than Napoleon.
You're prettier, too.
Nice!
Awfully cold around the heart.
I sell gasoline, I make a small profit. With that I buy groceries. The grocer makes a profit. We call it earning a living. You may have heard of it somewhere.
You can never help anything, can you? You're like a leaf that the wind blows from one gutter to another.
Don't you see you've only me to make deals with now?
Build my gallows high, baby.
Oh Jeff, you ought to have killed me for what I did a moment ago.
There's time.
How big a chump can you get to be? I was finding out.
It was the bottom of the barrel, and I was scraping it.
Why me?
Well, I know a lot of smart guys, and a few honest ones. And you're both.
Did you miss me?
No more than I would my eyes.
Nothing in the world is any good unless you can share it.
You know, maybe I was wrong and luck is like love. You have to go all the way to find it.
You do to keep it.
I think we deserve a break.
We deserve each other.
Well, the last guy in the world...
I hate surprises myself. You wanna just shut the door and forget it?
You just sit and stay inside yourself. You wait for me to talk. I like that.
I never found out much listening to myself.
Your uh... cousin is a very charming young lady.
No he isn't. His name is Norman, and he's a bookmaker in Cleveland Ohio.
Let's go down to the bar. We can cool off while we try to impress each other.
You are an idiot.
So's he.
You think so?
Why not? He's in love with you.
You say to yourself, ""How hot can it get?"" Then, in Acapulco, you find out.
I never saw her in the daytime. We seemed to live by night. What was left of the day went away like a pack of cigarettes you smoked. I didn't know where she lived. I never followed her. All I ever had to go on was a place and time to see her again. I don't know what we were waiting for. Maybe we thought the world would end.
Now, do you wanna talk business, or do you wanna play house...?
That evens us. Now fold your hands or I'll fold 'em for you!
I'm sorry he didn't die.
Give him time.
If it gets too lonely, there's a little cantina down the street called Pablo's. It's nice and quiet. The man there plays American music for a dollar. Sip bourbon and shut your eyes... it's like a little place on 56th Street.
I'll wear my earrings.
I sometimes go there.
Oh, Jeff. I've missed you. I've wondered about you and prayed you'd understand. Can you understand?
You prayed, Kathie?
If you'll drop this Junior League patter we may get the conversation down where it belongs.
You worried about something?
I don't know. Should I be?
Not if you do what you're told.
That's why I'm here. I do what I'm told. People trust me. Whit even trusts me twice. Do you?
Just as far as I have to.
I was expecting you.
Well... I wasn't expecting you.
Should I take that as a compliment?
Very difficult girl.
Is there one who is *not* so, Señor?
You don't know Whit. He won't forget.
Everybody forgets.
Not Whit.
So we'll send him a postcard every Christmas.
Jeff, I'm glad you're not afraid of him.
I've been afraid of half the things I ever did.
And this time?
I'm only afraid you might not go.
Don't be. I'll be there tomorrow.
I like surprises. When I was a kid, we were so busted that if we got anything at all for Christmas it was a big surprise.
We got a call to come over and see a big Op.
A what?
An operator. A gambler. He didn't come to see us because he was too high powered a character. Also because some dame had taken four shots at him with his own 38. Made one of 'em good.
Near the Plaza was a little cafe called La Mar Azul, next to a movie house. I sat there in the afternoons and drank beer. I used to sit there half asleep with a beer in the darkness, only the music from the movie next door kept jarring me awake. And then I saw her - coming out of the sun. And I knew why Whit didn't care about that 40 grand.
I could go down to the cliff and look at the sea like a good tourist. But, its no good if there isn't somebody you can turn to and say, ""Nice view there."" Its the same with the churches, the relics, the moonlight or a Cuba Libre.
I went to Pablo's that night. I knew I'd go every night until she showed up and I knew she knew it.
She waited until it was late. Then, she walked in out of the moonlight, smiling.
You know, you're a curious man.
You're going to make every guy you meet a little bit curious.
It's not what I mean.
You don't ask questions. You don't even ask me what my name is.
All right, what's your name.
Kathie.
I like it.
Or where I come from?
I'm thinking about where we're going.
I don't like playing games when I'm the fall guy. You might remember that, Whit.
You get your five grand back and Stephanos can take over from here.
You're wrong. I fire people but nobody quits me. You started this an you'll end it.
I went alone to LA and I made it easy for him to follow me. He was a good gumshoe. It was the one thing he could really do.
You wanna lift, baby?
You know, I really hadn't ought.
You're a cute little package to be out walking alone at night.
You're kinda cute yourself.
I can give you a tip. You tell Whit where we are, he might slip you a sawbuck.
Well, I told you it wasn't a nice story.
And I told you once that whatever happened was done.
Yeah, but you should have known about it long ago.
It's all right. I understand. But, it's all past.
Maybe it isn't.
Well, you told me about your business. Mine is a little more precarious and I earn considerably more.
So I've heard.
So has the government.
Well, this may sound ridiculous, but you could pay 'em.
Oh, that would be against my nature.
You know San Francisco, don't you?
Yeah, I was there once for a party.
And you got around?
Like the monkey and the weasel.
Would you like a gin and tonic?
That'd be nice.
You may have whiskey if you like.
That'd be even nicer.
Just remember, I'm coming out of this in one piece, Miss Carson.
Do you always go around leaving your fingerprints on a girl's shoulder? Not that I mind, particularly. You've got nice strong hands.
Keep the martinis dry. I'll be back.
For a man who appears to be clever, you can certainly act like an idiot.
That's one way to be clever! Look like an idiot.
You look like an underweight ghost.
Was there a slip up, baby?
I'm the fall guy. There's only one thing missing. The plant. What was it that gives me a motive? I wouldn't kill a guy for a martini.
I've never stopped loving you. I was afraid and no good, but, I've never stopped. Even if you'd hated me - did you?
Yes.
You know, sometimes a bad memory is like what they call an ill wind, it can blow somebody luck.
Well, we meet in in all kinds of places.
I'm running the show, don't forget it.
I doubt you'll ever let me.
Remember La Mar Azul?
I remember you were a very clumsy flirt - but I like that."
J. J. Gittes,AN,Hardboiled Detective,"What happened to your nose, Gittes? Somebody slammed a bedroom window on it?
Nope. Your wife got excited. She crossed her legs a little too quick. You understand what I mean, pal?
She's my daughter.
I said I want the truth!
She's my sister...
She's my daughter...
My sister, my daughter.
I said I want the truth!
She's my sister AND my daughter!
Are you alone?
Isn't everybody?
Tell me, Mr. Gittes: Does this often happen to you?
What's that?
Well, I'm judging only on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but, uh, if this is how you go about your work, I'd say you'd be lucky to, uh, get through a whole day.
Actually, this hasn't happened to me for a long time.
When was the last time?
Why?
It's an innocent question.
In Chinatown.
What were you doing there?
Working for the District Attorney.
Doing what?
As little as possible.
The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
They do in Chinatown.
My goodness, what happened to your nose?
I cut myself shaving.
You ought to be more careful. That must really smart.
Only when I breathe.
How much are you worth?
I have no idea. How much do you want?
I just wanna know what you're worth. More than 10 million?
Oh my, yes!
Why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What could you buy that you can't already afford?
The future, Mr. Gittes! The future. Now, where's the girl? I want the only daughter I've got left. As you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
Who do you blame for that? Her?
I don't blame myself. You see, Mr. Gittes, most people never have to face the fact that at the right time and the right place, they're capable of ANYTHING.
How'd you get past the guard?
Well, to tell you the truth, I lied a little.
But, Mrs. Mulwray, I goddamn near lost my nose. And I like it. I like breathing through it. And I still think you're hiding something.
Do you accept people of the Jewish persuasion?
I'm sorry, we do not.
Don't apologize - neither does Dad.
So there's this guy Walsh, do you understand? He's tired of screwin' his wife... So his friend says to him, ""Hey, why don't you do it like the Chinese do?"" So he says, ""How do the Chinese do it?"" And the guy says, ""Well, the Chinese, first they screw a little bit, then they stop, then they go and read a little Confucius, come back, screw a little bit more, then they stop again, go and they screw a little bit... then they go back and they screw a little bit more and then they go out and they contemplate the moon or something like that. Makes it more exciting."" So now, the guy goes home and he starts screwin' his own wife, see. So he screws her for a little bit and then he stops, and he goes out of the room and reads Life Magazine. Then he goes back in, he starts screwin' again. He says, ""Excuse me for a minute, honey."" He goes out and he smokes a cigarette. Now his wife is gettin' sore as hell. He comes back in the room, he starts screwin' again. He gets up to start to leave again to go look at the moon. She looks at him and says, ""Hey, what's the matter with ya? You're screwin' just like a Chinaman!""
You must really think I'm stupid, don't you, Gittes.
I don't think about it that much, but gimme a day or two and I'll get back to yuh. Now I'd like to go home.
I want the other pictures, Gittes.
What pictures?
THIS broad hired you, not Evelyn Mulwray.
Yeah?
Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake Mulwray down; she hired you. That's how come you found out he was murdered.
I heard it was an accident.
C'mon, Gittes. The hell d'you think you're dealing with? A bunch of assholes? Mulwray had salt water in his lungs. You were following him day and night; you SAW who killed him. You even took pictures of it. It was Evelyn Mulwray, and she's been payin' you off like a slot machine ever since.
You accusin' me of extortion?
Absolutely!
I don't think I need a day or two; you're dumber than you think I think y'are.
Mulvihill! What are you doing here?
They shut my water off. What's it to you?
How'd you find out about it? You don't drink it; you don't take a bath in it... They wrote you a letter. But then you have to be able to read.
What can I tell you, kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right.
All right, Curly. Enough's enough. You can't eat the Venetian blinds. I just had them installed on Wednesday.
After you've worked with a man a certain length of time, you come to know his habits, his values - you come to know him - and either he's the kind who chases after women or he isn't.
Mulwray isn't?
He never even kids about it.
Well, maybe he takes it very seriously.
You may think you know what you're dealing with, but, believe me, you don't.
Why is that funny?
That's what the District Attorney used to tell me in Chinatown.
You're dumber than you think I think you are.
Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.
Well, I've been accused of a lot of things before, Mrs. Mulwray, but never that.
A memorial service was held at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He passed away two weeks ago.
Why is that unusual?
He passed away two weeks ago and one week ago he bought the land. That's unusual.
Maid's night off?
Why?
What do you mean, why? Nobody's here, that's why.
I gave everyone the night off.
Easy. It's an innocent question.
No question from you is innocent, Mr. Gittes.
I guess you're right.
Isn't that your phone number?
Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.
Well, Mr. Gittes, you don't look too much the worse for wear, I must say! Now where's the girl?
I've got her.
Is she all right?
She's fine.
Well, where is she?
With her mother.
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray.
You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
Have you ever heard the expression ""Let sleeping dogs lie""? Sometimes you're better off not knowing.
I hope you don't mind. I believe they should be served with the head.
Fine... long as you don't serve the chicken that way.
There's something black in the green part of your eye.
Oh, that. It's a... it's a flaw in the iris.
Flaw?
Yes, it's a sort of birthmark.
Hello, Claude. Where'd you get the midget?
Evelyn, put that gun away. Let the police handle this.
He owns the police!
What makes you certain that your husband is, um, involved with someone?
A wife can tell.
Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your husband?
Yes, of course.
Then go home and forget everything.
He's rich! Do you understand? He thinks he can get away with anything.
There's no point in getting tough with me. I'm just...
I don't get tough with anyone, Mr. Gittes. My lawyer does.
How do you like them apples?
Let me explain something to you, Walsh. This business requires a certain amount of finesse.
Bad for glass.
Yeah, sure. Bad for the glass.
Son of a bitch! Goddamn Florsheim shoe!
What the hell is going on here, Lou?
I don't know. What's going on? What's happening with you?"
Eddie Valiant,AN,Hardboiled Detective,"You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
You don't know how hard it is being a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
I'm not bad. I'm just drawn that way.
Hey, Judge. Doesn't a dying rabbit deserve a last request?
Yeah, nose plugs would be nice.
I think you want a drink. So, how about it, Judge?
Well, why not? I don't mind prolonging the execution.
Happy trails.
No thanks, Eddie. I'm trying to cut down.
Drink the drink.
But I don't want the drink.
He doesn't want the drink.
He does.
I don't.
You do.
I don't.
You do.
I don't.
You do.
I don't.
You don't.
I do.
You don't.
I do.
You don't.
Listen, when I say I do, that means I do.
You crazy rabbit! I'm out there risking my neck for you, and what are you doing? Singing and dancing!
But I'm a toon. Toons are supposed to make people laugh.
Sit down!
You don't understand. Those people needed to laugh.
Then when they're done laughing, they'll call the cops. That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel.
Not Angelo. He'd never turn me in.
Why? Because you made him laugh?
That's right! A laugh can be a very powerful thing. Why, sometimes in life, it's the only weapon we have.
Holy smoke, he's a Toon!
Surprised?
Not really. That lame-brained freeway idea could only be cooked up by a Toon.
Not just ANY Toon...
Remember me, Eddie? When I killed your brother, I talked... just... like... THIS!
Yeah. Check the probate. Why, my Uncle Thumper had a problem with HIS probate, and he had to take these big pills, and drink lots of water.
Not prostate, you idiot, PROBATE!
Anybody know you're here?
Nobody. Not a soul, except, uh...
Who?
Well, you see, I didn't know where your office was. So I asked the newsboy. He didn't know. So I asked the fireman, the green grocerer, the butcher, the baker, they didn't know! But the liquor store guy... he knew.
In other words, the whole town knows you're here! Get out!
I'm through with taking falls / And bouncing off the walls / Without that gun, I'd have some fun / I'd kick you in the...
Nose!
Nose? That don't rhyme with ""walls.""
No, but this does.
She's married to Roger Rabbit?
Yeah. What a lucky girl.
Eh, what's up, Doc? Jumpin' without a parachute? Kinda dangerous, ain't it?
Yeah.
Yeah. You could get killed. Heh, heh.
You guys got a spare?
Uh, Bugs does.
Yeah?
Yeah, but I don't think you want it.
I do, I do, give it to me!
Gee, uh, better let him have it, Bugs.
Okay, Doc. Whatever you say, here's the spare.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Aw, no! AAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!
Aw, poor fella. Ha ha.
Yeah, ain't I a stinker?
My man!
Come to Lena!
Toons. Gets 'em every time.
What could have possibly happen to you to turn you into such a sourpuss?
You really want to know? I'll tell you. A toon killed my brother.
A toon? No!
Yes, a toon. We were investigating a robbery at the First National Bank of Toontown. Back in those days, me and Teddy liked working Toontown, thought it was a lot of laughs. Anyway, this guy got away with a zillion simoleons. We trailed him to a little dive down on Yukster Street. We went in. Only he got the drop on us, literally. Dropped a piano on us from fifteen stories. Broke my arm, Teddy never made it. I never did find out who that guy was. All I remember was him standing over me laughing, with those burning red eyes, and that high, squeaky voice. He disappeared into Toontown after that.
You mean you could've taken your hand out of that cuff at any time?
No, not at any time, only when it was funny.
A few weeks ago I had the good providence to stumble upon a plan of the city council. A construction plan of epic proportions. We're calling it a freeway.
Freeway? What the hell's a freeway?
Eight lanes of shimmering cement running from here to Pasadena. Smooth, safe, fast. Traffic jams will be a thing of the past.
Hey, I seen a rabbit.
Ya see?
Where?
He's right here in the bar.
Say hello... Harvey.
I told you so.
Seriously, what do you see in that guy?
He makes me laugh.
What's up, Doc?
Valiant, are you trying to give me a heart attack?
You need a heart, before you can have an attack.
Yeah, yeah. You got the will?
Sure. I got the will. Question is, do you have the way? I can tell you now it ain't gonna come cheap.
What do you think you're doing, chump?
Who are you callin' a chump, chimp?
GRRRR!
AAAHH-OOF!
Don't let me catch your peepin' face around here again. Got it? GRR!
OOGA-BOOGA!
Say, Eddie. That sure was a funny dance you did for the weasels. Do you think your days of being a sourpuss are over?
Only time will tell.
Yeah, well... put 'er there, pal.
Don't tell me you lost your sense of humor already?
Does this answer your question?
So that's why you killed Acme and Maroon? For this freeway? I don't get it.
Of course not. You lack vision, but I see a place where people get on and off the freeway. On and off, off and on all day, all night. Soon, where Toon Town once stood will be a string of gas stations, inexpensive motels, restaurants that serve rapidly prepared food. Tire salons, automobile dealerships and wonderful, wonderful billboards reaching as far as the eye can see. My God, it'll be beautiful.
So who's your client, Mr. Detective-to-the-Stars? Chilly Willy? Or Screwy Squirrel?
What'll it be?
I'll have a beer, doll. So what happened, huh? Somebody kidnapped Dinky Doodle?
Cut it out, Angelo.
No, wait a minute, wait a minute, I've got it. You're working for Little Bo Peep. She's lost her sheep, and you're gonna help her find them, huh?
Get this straight, meatball. I... don't... work... for toons.
So, what's his problem?
A toon killed his brother
What?
Dropped a piano on his head.
What's that?
Remember how they always thought there wasn't a way to kill a toon? Well, Doom found a way. Turpentine, acetone, benzene. He calls it ""The Dip.""
I'll catch the rabbit, Mr. Valiant. And I'll try him, convict him, and execute him.
Geez.
That's one dead shoe, eh, boss?
They're not kid gloves, Mr. Valiant. This is how we handle things down in Toontown. I would think you of all people would appreciate that.
Nice monkey suit.
Wise ass.
Cigars? Cigarettes?... Eddie Valiant!
Betty!
Long time, no see!
What are you doing here?
Work's been kinda slow since cartoons went to color. But I still got it, Eddie! ""Boop-boop-be-doop-*boop*!""
Yeah. You still got it.
Dolores, you need to find yourself a good man.
But I already have a good man.
P-p-please, don't mind me.
Jeepers, Eddie. That was swell. You saved my life. How can I ever repay ya?
For starters, don't ever kiss me again.
A ladies' man, eh?
The problem is I got a fifty year old lust and a three year old dinky. Look, Valiant, the rabbit didn't kill Acme. He's not a murderer, I should know, he's a dear friend of mine. I tell ya Valiant, the whole thing stinks like yesterday's diapers. Look at this. The papers said Acme left no will.
That's a load of succotash. Any toon knows Acme had a will. He promised to leave Toontown to us toons. That will is the real reason he got bumped off.
Has anyone ever seen this will?
Ah, no. But he gave us his solemn oath.
If you think that guy could do anything solemn, the gag's on you, pal.
I just thought that since you were the one who got my pal in trouble, you might wanna help get him out. I can pay ya.
Save your money for a pair of elevator shoes!
Hey hey hay, Valiant, wait!
My stogie!
WAAAAAAAA-HAHAHAHAAAAAA! WAAAAAAAAAAAAH! WAAAAAA...
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You mean to tell me that in a fit of jealousy you wrote your wife a love letter?
That's right! I knew that she was just an innocent victim of circumstance.
I suppose you used the old lipstick on the mirror routine.
Lipstick, yes. Mirror, no. I found a nice, clean piece of paper.
""Dear Jessica: How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. One one-thousand. Two one-thousand. Three one-thousand. Four one-thousand. Five...?
Say, Roger. That letter you wrote to your wife at the Ink and Paint Club? Why don't you read it to her now?
Sure thing, Eddie. ""Dear Jessica: How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body...? It's the will!
Keep reading.
""... do hereby bequeath, in perpetuity, the property known as Toontown, to those lovable characters, the toons""!
Valiant.
I always knew I'd get it in Toontown.
Behind you!
Drop it, lady!
I just saved your life, and you still don't trust me?
I don't trust anybody or anything!
Not even your own eyes?
That's the gun that killed R.K. Maroon, and Doom pulled the trigger.
Doom?
I tracked him to the studio, but I was too late to stop him.
That's right! You'll never stop me! You're dead! You're both dead!
Doom!
Which way did he go?
I don't know. He went thataway.
Let's go.
Dum-dums.
Pull the lever!
Which one?
Which one?
""Which one?""
No wonder you hate me. If a toon killed my brother, I'd hate me too.
Come on, don't cry. I don't hate you.
Yes, you do.
No, I don't.
You do hate me. Otherwise, you wouldn't have yanked my ears all those times.
Well, I'm... I'm sorry I yanked your ears.
All the times you yanked my ears?
All the times I yanked your ears.
Here's to the pencil pushers. May they all get lead poisoning.
Is this man removing evidence from the scene of the crime?
Ah, no, Judge Doom. Valiant here was just picking it up for you. Weren't you, Eddie?
Hand it over.
Sure.
Their number one seller.
I see working for a toon has rubbed off on you.
I wasn't working for a toon. I was working for R.K. Maroon.
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon. He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures. The rabbit said one way or another he and his wife were going to be happy. Is that true?
Bah! What do I look like? A stenographer?
Shut your yap, Eddie. The man's a judge.
That's all right, Lieutenant. From the smell of him, I'd say it was the booze talking.
What's with him?
Mr. Acme never misses a night when Jessica performs.
Got a thing for rabbits, huh?
You think that's funny?
It's a panic!
You won't think it's funny when I stick that pen up your nose!
Now, calm down, son, will ya? Look, the stain is gone. It's disappearing ink.
No hard feelings, I hope. Listen, I'm...
I know who you are. Marvin Acme, The guy that owns Toontown, the Gag King.
If it's Acme, it's a gasser. Put 'er there, pal.
The hand buzzer. Still our biggest seller.
How much do you know about show business, Mr. Valiant?
Only that there is no business like it, no business I know.
Yeah. And there's no business more expensive. I'm 25 grand over budget on the latest Baby Herman cartoon. You've seen the rabbit blowing his lines. He can't keep his mind on his job. You know why?
One too many refrigerators dropped on his head?
Nah, he's a toon. You can drop anything you want on his head, he'll shake it off. But break his heart, goes to pieces just like you and me.
You wouldn't have any idea where the rabbit might be, Mr. Valiant?
Have you tried Walla Walla? Cucamonga? I hear Kokomo's very nice this time of the year.
I'm surprised you're not more cooperative, Mr. Valiant. A human has been murdered by a toon. Don't you appreciate the magnitude of that?
Gee whiz, Eddie, if you really needed money so bad, then why didn't you come to me?
So I took a couple of dirty pictures, kill me.
I've already got a stiff on my hands, thank you.
Huh?
Marvin Acme. The rabbit cacked him last night.
Don't make us play rough, Valiant. We just want the rabbit.
What are we gonna do, Eddie? What are we gonna do, Eddie? What are we gonna do?
What's all this ""we"" stuff? They just want the rabbit.
Kinda jumpy, aren't you, Mr. Valiant? It's just Dumbo.
I KNOW who it is.
I got him on loan from Disney - him and half the cast of Fantasia. The best part is, they work for peanuts.
Okay, wise-guy. Where's the rabbit?
Haven't seen 'im.
What's in there?
My lingerie.
I see, Valiant.
Oh, wook, piddies!
Hi, Tweety.
This wittle piddy went to market.
This wittle piddy stayed home.
No.
This wittle piddy had woast beef...
And *this* wittle piddy - had...
Uh-oh, wan outta piddies.
Hide me Eddie... PLLLEASE.
Remember you never saw me.
GET OUT OF THERE.
Judge Doom killed Marvin Acme.
And R.K. Maroon. And my brother.
Now that's what I call one seriously disturbed toon.
Do you wanna tell me what she was doing with her arms around you?
Probably looking for a good place to stick a knife!
Come on, Eddie! I caught you with your pants down!
Ah, that's better. I can't believe they locked me up for driving on the sidewalk.
Come on, Eddie, get in!
It was only a couple of MILES.
I'll drive.
But I wanna drive.
No. I'LL drive, I'M the cab! Outta my way, pencil neck!
You see, Mr. Valiant, the successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist in Toontown. I'm retiring, taking a new role in the private sector.
That wouldn't be Cloverleaf Industries, by any chance?
You're looking at the sole stockholder.
Scotch on the rocks... and I MEAN ICE!
Well, we're not going anywhere in my car. Let's take yours.
I have a feeling someone already did.
From the looks of it I'd say it was Roger. My honey bunny was never very good behind the wheel.
Better lover than a driver, huh?
You'd better believe it, buster.
Roger, I know this seems pretty painful now, but you'll find someone new. Won't he, Mr. Valiant?
Good looking guy like that? Dames will be breaking his doors down.
Dames? What dames?
Jessica's the only one for me. You'll see. We'll rise above this piddling pecadillo. We're gonna be happy again. You got that? Happy. Capital H-A-P-P-I.
At least he took it well.
Where's the other fifty?
Let's call the other fifty a carrot to finish the job.
You've been hanging around rabbits too long.
Tomorrow's Friday, Eddie. You know what happens here on Friday?
Fish special?
Well, my boss checks the books on Friday. And if I don't have that money I gave you back in the till, I'm gonna lose my job.
Don't bust a button, Dolores.
You've only got one left.
What are you gonna do to me, Valiant?
I'm gonna listen to you spin the Cloverleaf scenario. The story of greed, sex and murder. And the parts that I don't like, I'm gonna edit out.
You got it all wrong, Valiant. I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
Everybody's gotta have a hobby.
Got the password?
Walt sent me.
Look, Valiant, we got a reliable tip-off. The rabbit was here. It was corrugated by several others. So cut the ""bull-shtick""!
You keep talkin' like that, and I'm gonna have to wash your mouth out!
This singing ain't my line / It's hard to make a rhyme / If I get stuck, I'm... I'm out of luck, and... and...
I'm running out of time!
Thanks.
I'm glad Teddy isn't here to see me running with my tail between my legs.
It's not so bad, once you get used to it.
Weren't you the one I caught playing pattycake with old man Acme?
You didn't catch me, Mr. Valiant. You were set up to take those pictures.
What are you talking about?
Maroon wanted to blackmail Acme. I didn't want to have anything to do with it, but he said that if I didn't pose for those pattycake pictures, Roger would never work in this town again. I couldn't let that happen. I'd do anything for my husband, Mr. Valiant. Anything.
What a wife.
Forget it. I don't work Toontown.
What's wrong with Toontown? Every Joe loves Toontown.
Then get Joe to do the job, 'cause I ain't going.
No! Not my Jessica! Not pattycake! It can't be! It just can't be! Jessica's my wife! It's absolutely impossible! Jessica's the love of my life. The apple of my eye. The cream in my coffee.
Well you better start drinking it black, Acme's taking the cream now.
So why come to me? I'm the one who took the pictures of your wife.
Yeah, and you're also the one who helped all these toons. Everyone knows that when a toon's in trouble, there's only one place to go: Valiant & Valiant.
Not anymore.
I don't know who's toonier, you or Doom.
Let me see that will.
I told you, I got it.
I wanna see it now!
""How do I love thee, let me count the ways""? Is this supposed to be a joke?
No, this is.
Have they got the will or not?
Nah, just a stupid love letter.
No matter. I doubt the will'll show up in the next fifteen minutes, anyway.
What happens in the next fifteen minutes?
Toontown will be legally mine, lock, stock and barrel.
Can I borrow your camera? Mine's at the shop.
Wouldn't be the pawn shop, by any chance?
C'mon, Dolores. You want the other fifty, I need the camera.
Any film in there?
Should be. Haven't had that film developed since our trip to Catalina. Sure was a long time ago.
Yeah. that was along time ago. We should do that again some time.
Yeah, sure, Eddie.
So, how long have you known it was Doom?
Before poor Marvin was killed, he confided in me that Judge Doom wanted to get his hands on Toontown, and he wouldn't stop at anything.
So he gave you the will for safe keeping.
That's what he told me, except when I opened the envelope, there was only a blank piece of paper inside.
Ha! A joker to the end.
Everything's funny to you, ain't it, needlenose?
You got a problem with that, Valiant?
No, I just want you to know something about the guy you're gonna dip.
Now Roger is his name / Laughter is his game / C'mon you dope, untie his rope / And watch him go insane.
He's lost his mind.
I don't think so.
The job will cost you a hundred bucks, plus expenses.
A hundred bucks? That's ridiculous!
So's the job.
Hey, mister. Ain't you got a car?
Who needs a car in L.A.? We have the best public transportation system in the world.
Listen, my philosophy is this: If you don't have a good sense of humor, you're better off dead.
You might just get your wish if we don't find out what happened to this.
What is it, Eddie?
Just look at it.
Mister Acme's will!
Yeah, and I think Acme took the part of sound mind, and your wife of sound body.
Why, I resent that innuendo!
Uh-oh. It's the weasels! This way. We'll take Gingerbread Lane.
No, no! Gingerbread Lane's this way!
So, Valiant, you call a cab or what?
Hubba, hubba, hubba!
Allow me, mademoiselle.
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! The truth is, I had a chance to sell my studio. But Cloverleaf wouldn't buy my property unless Acme sold them his. The stubborn bastard wouldn't sell, so I was going to blackmail him with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife. Blackmail, that's all! I've been around toons all my life! I didn't want to see them destroyed!
Toons destroyed? Why?
If I tell you, I'm a dead man.
You're a dead man if you don't tell me.
Unless Acme's will shows by midnight tonight, Toontown's gonna be land for the free...
What in Sam Hill?
Eddie Valiant! Why, you're a sight for sore eyes.
I ain't seen you nigh onto five years.
Where've you been?
Drunk. You feeling frisky tonight, fellas?
, :
Yeah!
, :
Yeah!
Let's go.
Nobody's gonna drive this lousy freeway when they can take the Red Car for a nickel.
Oh, they'll drive. They'll have to. You see, I bought the Red Car so I could dismantle it.
I thought you said you'd never take another toon case. What did you have a change of heart?
Nothing's changed. Somebody's made a patsy outta me and I'm gonna find out why!
Let's forget it, there's nobody here!
Is that it, or are you scared?
P-p-p-p-please! Me, scared? Don't be ridiculous!
When you called Maroon, you told him you had the will, but you don't. When he finds out, he's gonna be mad! He might try to kill ya.
I can handle a Hollywood cream puff. I just don't want the odds to change. You cover my back. If you hear or see anything, beep the horn twice.
Yeah, that's it, beep the horn twice. Cover your back. Boy, I'm ready: dukes up, eyes peeled, ears to the ground. Why, nobody gets the drop on Roger Rabbit!
Eddie Valiant, you're under arrest! Pbbbbbbbbb...
Get outta there! Idiot, I got no keys for these cuffs!
Oh, no! Where's Roger?
Roger? He chickened out on me back at the studio.
No, he didn't. I hit him over the head with a frying pan and stuck him in the trunk. So he wouldn't get hurt.
Makes perfect sense.
We searched Valiant boss. The will ain't on him.
Then frisk the woman.
*I'll* handle this one...
Nice booby trap.
Do they have the will or not?
Nah, just a stupid love letter.
No matter. I doubt that will is going to show up in the next fifteen minutes anyway.
What happens in the next fifteen minutes?
Toontown will be legally mine, lock, stock and barrel.
We'll handle Mr. Valiant our own way: downtown.
Downtown? Fine. I'll just get a hold of Santino. I'll be more than happy to go downtown.
Oh, I'm not talking about *that* downtown. I'm talking about downtown *Toon*town!
Rummaging around in a lady's dressing room? Tsk, tsk, tsk. What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?
Last week, some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir.
Look, doll, if I'd wanted underwear, I'd have broken into Frederick's of Hollywood. You know damn well I was looking for Marvin Acme's will.
Marvin Acme had no will. I should know; the estate's in my jurisdiction.
Oh, there was a will all right. And she and R.K. Maroon killed him for it.
That's absurd!
Someone else is in here looking for the will, too. Probably Maroon's flunkies.
I would've caught 'em, too, if Cheetah here hadn't have interrupted me!
I'm on the verge of wrapping up this case.
Hey! I seen a rabbit.
Where?
See?
*Where*?
He's right here in the bar.
Well, say hello... Harvey.
I told ya so.
GET OUT OF THAT CHAIR!... That's my brother's chair.
Yeah, where is your brother anyway? He looks like a sensitive and... SOBER fellow.
That's it. I'm calling the cops.
Go ahead. Call the cops. I come here for help and what do you do? Yo turn me in. No, don't feel guilty about me. So long, and thanks for nothing.
That's the closet! Stupe!"
Agatha,AS,Junkie Prophet,"He knows, don't go home.
Think about all the lives that little girl has saved.
Think about all the lives that little girl has saved, think about all the lives she will save, that little girl could have saved Sean.
Don't you *ever* say his name!
You used the memory of my dead son to set me up.
You used the memory of my dead son to set me up! That was the one thing you knew would drive me to murder.
What are you going to do now, Lamar?
What're you going to do now, Lamar?
How are you...
...going to shut me up?
I'm sorry, John.
Dr. Hineman once said, ""The dead don't die. They look on and help."" Remember that, John.
Agatha...
Sean... He's on the beach now, a toe in the water. He's asking you to come in with him. He's been racing his mother up and down the sand. There's so much love in this house. He's ten years old. He's surrounded by animals. He wants to be a vet. You keep a rabbit for him, a bird and a fox. He's in high school. He likes to run, like his father. He runs the two-mile and the long relay. He's 23. He's at a university. He makes love to a pretty girl named Claire. He asks her to be his wife. He calls here and tells Lara, who cries. He still runs. Across the university and in the stadium, where John watches. Oh God, he's running so fast, just like his daddy. He sees his daddy. He wants to run to him. But he's only six years old, and he can't do it. And the other men are so fast. There was so much love in this house.
I want him back so bad.
So did she. Can't you see? She just wanted her little girl back. But it was too late. Her little girl was already gone.
She's still alive.
She didn't die, but she's not alive.
Agatha, just tell me, who killed your mother? Who killed Anne Lively?
I'm sorry John, but you're gonna have to run again.
What?
RUUUUUUUUUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!
Everyday for the last six years I've thought of only two things. The first is what Sean would look like if he were alive today, if I would recognize him if I saw him on the street, the second is what I would do to the man who took him if I ever found him. You're right... I'm not being set up.
You have to take me home.
No. You said so yourself. There is no minority report, I don't have an alternate future. I am going to kill this man.
Where's my Minority Report?
DO I EVEN HAVE ONE?
Do I have one?
No.
Is this now?
You still have a choice.
Can you see?
Murder.
I'm sorry, John, but you're going to have to run again.
You can choose...
Is it now?"
Cassie Holmes,AS,Junkie Prophet,"There are special people in this world. We don't ask to be special. We're just born this way. We pass you on the streets every day, unnoticed by most. It started in 1945. The Nazis were conducting experiments in psychic warfare, trying to turn those with psychic abilities into soldiers. Lots of us died. The war ended, but the experiments never stopped. Other governments around the world set up what they called ""divisions"", trying to do what the Nazis couldn't, to turn us into weapons. The divisions agents are trained to track and hunt us down like animals. Take us away from our families and friends. They test us and categorize us. I'm what they call a Watcher. We can see the future, even if that's not always as simple as it sounds. Others are called Movers; just an easy way of saying telekinetic. Pushers put thoughts in your head, and make whatever lie they come up with the truth. Sniffs, Shifters, Shadows, Bleeders... it goes on and on. In divisions' eyes, we're all just lab rats. Only one problem - we keep dying. No one has ever survived the drug meant to boost our powers. My name is Cassie Holmes. Division took my mom from me. Right now, the future I see doesn't look so great. The good news is, the future is always changing, in the largest of ways, by the smallest of things. They've been winning a lot of battles. Now it's our turn to win the war.
Tell me I'm a crappy artist and that everything is going to be fine.
You are a *crappy* artist. Everything is going to be fine, I promise.
Nick!
Bring an umbrella. It's gonna rain.
You be careful too.
You better do something quick, 'cause I'm getting sick of drawing dead bodies!
How are we going to make the future unpredictable?
By not knowing what we're going to do, until right before we do it.
A plan without planning.
How long do you think your mom's been planning this?
Probably since before I was born.
Did you lose a bet with your hairdresser?
No! I just like color!
Hey, what did I inject myself with?
Nine Dragons Soy Sauce.
That's gross.
You already know the ending to this story. You can only draw it so many ways.
We're going to change it.
Hey, whoa whoa whoa...
Excuse me.
This how you treat your guests?
This is how I treat random strangers who barge into my apartment.
Stupid child. I already saw how you die.
Then you know it's not here, and it's not today.
Vodka martini.
Thank you.
I'll have one of those.
She'll have a Coke.
My mom drinks when she wants to get really clear images. She's famous for it.
Maybe something without caffeine.
I know who you are. When I was in Division, your mother was at the top of every watchlist there was.
You worked for division?
You want to know about division? Ten years. No thank you. No pension. I was put out on the street with the threat not to shift again. Only the Sniffs caught up with me in Chicago. I was just trying to buy something nice for my wife. Next day, I get a call. She's dead. Car accident. But my wife doesn't drive.
My father expects me to find that suitcase.
So does my mother.
But you don't see it clearly, do you? Too many things keep changing. I already saw how you die. Did you see it yet?
You can change it, you know. Plenty of planes leaving Hong Kong every day.
Oh, we *are* going to change it.
You put a Shadow on the girl. You know that's only temporary. That girl is the one who brings all your little fantasy crashing down. So tell Nick something for me, little girl. Tell him my family going to make his brain pop like a tomato! Tell him that's the future I see.
Where's the chicky-chicky who gets us all killed?
Are you drunk?
Yeah.
I heard what she said about your mother.
You did? Division's got her. They locked her up because she's the greatest Watcher they've ever seen. They're afraid of her, and they're afraid they can't control it.
They killed my father for the same reason. But I guess you already knew that.
I see the future, not the past. Right now, our future is not that great.
Sorry, I didn't know the procedure for stopping a blitzed ten year old.
I'm thirteen!
First thing's first. I know you're a second generation Mover.
Is that what the kids are calling it these days?
I'll let you know when I see one. You don't really use your powers, which means you haven't practiced, so you kind of suck at it. How am I doing so far?
Go on.
I'm a Watcher. Second generation, like you.
Wow, that's...
Complicated, cause the future can change just by talking about it, so I see glimpses, and I draw about it in my book, but I'm not really good at it. I'm kind of a crappy artist, but I'm sure you already knew that.
Are you with division?
Are you looking at us?
Are you okay?
No. Not until we find that case.
When was the last time you saw it?
Not since yesterday. Not for lack of trying. If we don't find it soon, they're going to kill my mom. And it's going to be my fault.
Look at me. Hey...
Look at me. You really think I'm going to let that happen? Now you said that the future is always changing, right? It can change just by knowing it?
It can change. Doesn't mean it will.
Good enough.
What are you doing? What are you going to go do?
I'm going to try to make a better one.
You don't get it, Nick. She's the one that kills us all, basically!
Well I guess we're all going to get killed!
Yeah! It's screwed up!
By we, do you mean not...
You too!
You make me look like a fool in front of my family!
Don't worry. You won't remember a thing.
Who sent you?
Your mother. A week before she was captured by Division, she told me to be at that fish market today.
Stay away from him.
If that's what you want. Just be sure to add his picture to the Wall of the Dead.
You look like shit.
Please don't make me do anything to myself.
I'm 13, and I've been told I look at least 14.
We need this.
An olive?
It's a bead.
I think I just saved your life. No need to thank me, you should just start listening to me.
I am thirteen. And I'm empowering my youth."
Beni Gabor,S,Coward,"O'Connell! Hey, O'Connell! It looks to me like I've got all the horses!
Hey, Beni! Looks to me like you're on the wrong side of the *river*!
Well if it ain't my little buddy Beni. I think I'll kill you.
Think of my children.
You don't have any children
Someday I might.
As long as I serve him, I am immune.
Immune from what?
Filthy animal.
What did you say?
I don't wanna tell you. You'll just hurt me some more.
It is better to be the right hand of the devil than in his path.
You came back from the desert with a new friend, didn't you, Beni?
What friend? You are my only friend.
You never believed in Hamunaptra, O'Connell. Why are you going back?
You see that girl?
She saved my neck.
You always did have more balls than brains.
I loved the whole sand wall trick. It was beautiful. Bastard.
So, what's the scam, Beni? You take them out into the middle of the desert and then you leave 'em to rot?
Unfortunately, no. These Americans are smart. They pay me only half now, half when I get them back to Cairo. So this time I must go all the way.
Them's the breaks, huh?
You just got promoted.
Prenez vos positions! Steady!
You're with me on this one, right?
Oh, your strength gives me strength.
You know, nasty little fellows such as yourself always get their comeuppance.
Really? They do?
Oh, yes. Always.
You're gonna get yours, Beni! You hear me? You're gonna get yours!
Oh, like I've never heard *that* before!
It's the creature. He's fully regenerated.
Come with me, my princess. It is time to make you mine, forever.
For all eternity, idiot.
Take my hand and I will spare your friends.
The language of the slaves... I may have use for you. And the rewards...
... will be great.
My prince.
Where are the other sacred jars?
Mr. Burns, Prince Imhotep thanks you for your hospitality.
No.
And for your eyes, and for your tongue.
Wha...
But I'm afraid more is needed. The prince must finish the job... and consummate the curse, which you and your friends have brought down upon yourselves.
I need a new job.
It is three days down the Nile, then two days by camel, Barat'm.
All the money we're payin' you, there better be something under that sand.
Hamunaptra, Daniels. That's all you gotta keep telling yourself. Hamunaptra.
We're gonna find it, boys, and we're gonna make history.
And get rich doin' it.
Let's load it up! Let's load it up! Everything's in order, gentlemen.
Thank you, Doctor.
Stop it! You'll kill them!
That's the idea."
Lt. Roget / Singing man,S,Coward,"How far did you advance?
To about the middle of no man's land, sir.
Then what did you do?
Well... I saw that me and Meyer...
I didn't ask you what you saw. The court has no concern with your visual experiences.
I went back, sir.
In other words, Private Ferol, you retreated.
Yes, sir.
I have no further questions."
Ike Clanton,S,Coward,"Wyatt Earp, huh? I heard of you.
Listen, Mr. Kansas Law Dog. Law don't go around here. Savvy?
I'm retired.
Good. That's real good.
Yeah, that's good, Mr. Law Dog, 'cause law don't go around here.
I heard you the first time.
Winner to the King, five hundred dollars.
Shut up, Ike.
And you must be Doc Holliday.
That's the rumor.
You retired too?
Not me. I'm in my prime.
Yeah, you look it.
And you must be Ringo. Look, darling, Johnny Ringo. The deadliest pistoleer since Wild Bill, they say. What do you think, darling? Should I hate him?
You don't even know him.
Yes, but there's just something about him. Something around the eyes, I don't know, reminds me of... me. No. I'm sure of it, I hate him.
He's drunk.
In vino veritas.
Age quod agis.
Credat Judaeus apella, non ego.
Eventus stultorum magister.
In pace requiescat.
Come on boys. We don't want any trouble in here. Not in any language.
Evidently Mr. Ringo's an educated man. Now I really hate him.
What is that now? Twelve hands in a row? Holliday, son of a bitch, nobody's that lucky.
Why Ike, whatever do you mean? Maybe poker's just not your game Ike. I know! Let's have a spelling contest!
All right, Clanton... you called down the thunder, well now you've got it! You see that?
It says United States Marshal!
Wyatt, please, I...
Take a good look at him, Ike... 'cause that's how you're gonna end up!
The Cowboys are finished, you understand? I see a red sash, I kill the man wearin' it!
So run, you cur... RUN! Tell all the other curs the law's comin'!
You tell 'em I'M coming... and hell's coming with me, you hear?...
Hell's coming with me!
That's Virgil there with the women.
He's mine, understand?
Hey Mattie! Where's Wyatt?
Right behind you, Stillwell.
So, there's nothin' I can say to get you to come back?
Not after what you done. Not after shootin' at the Earp's women.
All right then, I guess you can just get back on your horse and ride back down there to your new friends.
Hey. I just got one question; how're you planning on gettin' back down there?
What's wrong with him?
Lunger.
Yeah, well I hope you die."
Cpl. Timothy P. Upham,S,Coward,"Fucked up beyond all recognition.
FUBAR.
What's the saying? ""If God's on our side, who the hell could be on theirs?""
""If God is for us, who could be against us?""
Yeah, what'd I say?
You wanna explain the math of this to me? I mean, where's the sense of riskin' the lives of the eight of us to save one guy?
Twenty degrees. Anybody wanna answer that?
Reiben, think about the poor bastard's mother.
Hey, Doc, I got a mother, all right? I mean, you got a mother. Sarge's got a mother. I mean, shit, I bet even the captain's got a mother.
Well, maybe not the captain, but the rest of us got mothers.
""Theirs not to reason why, theirs but to do and die.""
La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la. What the fuck is that supposed to mean, Corporal, huh? We're all supposed to die, is that it?
Upham's talking about our duty as soldiers.
Yes, sir.
We all have orders, and we have to follow 'em. That supersedes everything, including your mothers.
Yes, sir. Thank you sir.
Even if you think the mission's FUBAR, sir?
*Especially* if you think the mission's FUBAR.
What's FUBAR?
Oh, it's German.
Yeah.
Never heard of that.
So where are you from, Captain? What'd you do before the war?
What's the pool up to?
Uh... up over three hundred, sir.
Well, when it gets up to five hundred, I'll give you the answers and we'll split the money. How about that?
Well, if that's the way you feel sir, then I feel it's my duty and your command to suggest that we wait until it gets up to a thousand, sir.
What if we don't live that long?
Five hundred?
Five hundred would be good, yeah. Get some sleep Corporal.
Yes, sir."
Aughra,AD,Eccentric Mentor,"End, begin, all the same. Big change. Sometimes good. Sometimes bad.
Where is he?
He's dead.
Could be anywhere, then.
Now, ask what the Great Conjunction is, what's the Great Conjunction?
What's the Great Conjunction? You tell me!
THE GREAT CONJUNCTION IS THE END OF THE WORLD! Or the beginning. Hm! End of Aughra? Hmph! End, Begin, all the same, Big Change...
Kira! Call the animals! You have the gift!
Kahmalaiah! Ah! Ah! Ah!
What was sundered and undone shall be whole - the two made one.
Mouldy mildew, mother of mouthmuck, dangle and strangle and death.
Another Great Conjunction coming up! Anything could happen! Whole WORLD might burn up!
End of Aughra! Hm!
Ya look like Gelfling...
SMELL like Gelfling...
maybe y'ARE Gelfling!
Questions, questions, too many questions. You want a shard? Here!
Which one is it?
Don't know? MmmmmMmmmmah! Don't know? Listen, Gelfling, there is much to be learned. And you have no time.
Now, ask what the Great Conjunction is. What's the Great Conjunction?
What's the Great Conjunction? You tell me.
The Great Conjunction is the end of the world. Or the beginning."
Mr. Kesuke Miyagi,AD,Eccentric Mentor,"Hey, what kind of belt do you have?
Canvas. JC Penney, $3.98. You like?
No, I meant...
In Okinawa, belt mean no need rope to hold up pants.
Daniel-san...
Karate here.
Karate here.
Karate never here. Understand?
Hey - you ever get into fights when you were a kid?
Huh - plenty.
Yeah, but it wasn't like the problem I have, right?
Why? Fighting fighting. Same same.
Yeah, but you knew karate.
Someone always know more.
You mean there were times when you were scared to fight?
Always scare. Miyagi hate fighting.
Yeah, but you like karate.
So?
So, karate's fighting. You train to fight.
That what you think?
No.
Then why train?
So I won't have to fight.
Miyagi have hope for you.
First, wash all car. Then wax. Wax on...
Hey, why do I have to...?
Ah ah! Remember deal! No questions!
Yeah, but...
Hai!
Wax on, right hand. Wax off, left hand. Wax on, wax off. Breathe in through nose, out the mouth. Wax on, wax off. Don't forget to breathe, very important.
Wax on, wax off. Wax on, wax off.
Karate come from China, sixteenth century, called te, ""hand."" Hundred year later, Miyagi ancestor bring to Okinawa, call *kara*-te, ""empty hand.""
I thought it came from Buddhist temples and stuff like that.
You too much TV.
Your friend, all karate student, eh?
Friend? Oh, yeah, those guys.
Problem: attitude.
No the problem is, I'm getting my ass kicked every other day, that's the problem.
Hai, because boys have bad attitude. Karate for defense only.
That's not what these guys are taught.
Hai - can see. No such thing as bad student, only bad teacher. Teacher say, student do.
Oh, great, that solves everything for me. I'll just go down to the school and straighten it out with the teacher, no problem.
Now use head for something other than target.
Go, find balance.

Banzai, Daniel-san.
Hey, banzai!
Banzai!
Banzai!
Banzai!
Banzai!
Hold it!
Sorry, teachers and students only.
Oh, well, uh... he doesn't speak English and, uh, I can't understand his instructions without her. She's his, uh, translator.

What did he say?
He says that, uh, you remind him of an uncle he has back in Tokyo.
I guess it's okay.

What?
He says you're very kind.
Thank you.
Welcome.
Make block. Left, right. Up, down. Side, side. Breathe in, breathe out. And no scare fish.
Now, ready?
Yeah, I guess so.
Daniel-san, must talk.
Walk on road, hm? Walk right side, safe. Walk left side, safe. Walk middle, sooner or later
get the squish just like grape. Here, karate, same thing. Either you karate do ""yes"" or karate do ""no."" You karate do ""guess so,""
just like grape. Understand?
Yeah, I understand.
Now, ready?
Yeah, I'm ready.
How did you do that? How did you do that?
Don't know. First time.
All right, so what are the rules here?
Don't know. First time you, first time me.
Well, I figured you knew about this stuff. I figured you went to these before. Oh great, I'm dead. I am dead. You told me you fought a lot.
For life, not for points.
Class, we have visitors. Fall in behind me. Hai!
I hear you jumped some of my students last night.
Afraid facts mixed up.
You calling Mr. Lawrence a liar?
No call no one nothing.
What are you here for, old man?
Come ask leave boy alone.
What's the matter, the boy can't take care of his own problems?
One to one problem, yes. FIVE to one problem, too much ask anyone.
Is that what's bothering you? The odds? Well, we can fix that. Feel like matching, Mr. Lawrence?
Yes, sensei!
No more fighting.
This is a karate dojo, not a knitting class. You don't come into my dojo, drop a challenge and leave, old man. Now you get your boy on the mat, or you and I will have a major problem.
Too much advantage. Your dojo.
Name a place.
Tournament.
You've got real nerve, old man. Real nerve. But I think we can accomodate you. Can't we, Mr. Lawrence?
Yes, sensei.
Fall in.
Ask one more small request.
Make it fast.
Ask leave boy alone to train.
You're a pushy little bastard, ain't ya? But I like that. I like that! All right. No one touches the prima donna until the tournament. Is that understood?
But if you don't show, it's open season on him... and you.
Oh, miss spot.
What spot? Hey, how come you didn't tell me you were goin' fishing?
You not here when I go.
Well, maybe I wanted to go, you ever think of that?
You karate training.
I'm *what*? I'm bein' your goddamn *slave* is what I'm bein' here man, now c'mon we made a deal here!
So?
So? So, you're supposed to teach and I'm supposed to learn! For 4 days I've been bustin' my ass, and haven't learned a goddamn thing!
You learn plenty.
I learn plenty, yeah, I learned how to sand your decks maybe. I washed your car, paint your house, paint your fence. I learn plenty!
Ah, not everything is as seems...
Oh, bullshit! I'm goin' home, man!
Daniel-san! Daniel-san!
What?
Come here.
Wouldn't a fly swatter be easier?
Man who catch fly with chopstick accomplish anything.
Ever catch one?
Not yet.
Could you teach me?
First learn stand, then learn fly. Nature rule, Daniel-san, not mine.
Where'd you learn it from?
Father teach.
You musta had some father, man.
Oh yes.
Excuse me, please. Boy cold. Must leave. Kindly remove bottles.
Kindly do it yourself, Mr. Moto.
When do I learn how to punch?
Better learn balance. Balance is key. Balance good, karate good. Everything good. Balance bad, better pack up, go home. Understand?
You're the best friend I've ever had.
You... pretty okay, too.
Hey, where did these old cars come from?
Detroit.
Wax on... wax off. Wax on... wax off.
Is that all...?
Never had karate training like this before; sure wish I knew how it worked.
You find out, Daniel-san; just give time. And no forget breathe! In through nose, out through mouth; very important.
At least I got something to look forward to.
Always *much* look forward to. Come; less chit-chat, more wax, more breathe...! Very good, Daniel-san.
Daniel-san. Secret to punch, make the power of whole body fit inside one inch, here.
Power, whole body, one inch, here. Now, punch. Hard.
What'sa matter, you some kind of girl or something?
Punch! Drive a punch! Not just arm, whole body! Hip, leg, drive a punch! Make ""kiai."" Kiai! Kiai! Give you power. Now, try punch.

Hey, pretty good, huh? Kiai!
Hey, look at this, Miyagi. Kiai!
Matte- mat-matte.
Kiai! Kiai!
Wait-wait, Daniel-san.
Kiai! Kiai!
Ch-ch-ch-chotto
Hey, what do you think, Mr. Miyagi, huh?
I tell you what Miyagi think! I think you *dance around* too much! I think you *talk* too much! I think you not concentrate enough! Lots of work to be done! Tournament just around the corner! Come. Stand up! Now, ready. Concentrate. Focus power.
Banzai!
To baby trees.
Not bonsai, BANZAI!
When am I gonna learn how to punch?
Learn how punch, after you learn how keep dry!
I don't know if I know enough karate.
Feeling correct.
You sure know how to make a guy feel confident.
You trust the quality of what you know, not quantity.
I'm not by myself. I'm with you.
To make honey, young bee need young flower, not old prune.
Go outside. Something show you.
What?
Number two present.
Number two present? You don't have to give me anything. You've given me enough already.
No really, I'm serious.
Choose.
Oh, no...
Hai! Hurt old man feeling.
Choose.
We make sacred pact. I promise teach karate to you, you promise learn. I say, you do, no questions.
I can't believe this. I cannot believe this.
What?
What you just got me into in there.
Huh?
You said you were going to make things better for me.
But I did.
How?
How? Just saved you two months beating.
Oh great now I really have something to look forward to.
Just remember, license never replace eye, ear, and brain.
What matter?
I'm just scared. The tournament and everything.
You remember lesson about balance?
Yeah.
Lesson not just karate only. Lesson for whole life. Whole life have a balance. Everything be better. Understand?
Oh, Daniel-san! You all wet behind ear!
Oh, great, that solves everything for me. I'll just go down to the school and straighten it out with the teacher, no problem.
Now use head for something other than target.
Hey, I was just kidding about that.
Why kidding?
Because I'd get killed if I go down there.
Get killed anyway.
Why didn't you tell me?
Tell what?
That you knew karate.
You not ask.
Well, where'd you learn it?
Father.
But I thought he was a fisherman.
In Okinawa, all Miyagi know two things: fish and karate.
Where am I, this ring over here?
Hai. Number three.
What's that guy kneeling like that for?
Don't know.
Don't you know anything you can tell me?
Hai. No get hit.
Look eye!, always look eye!
No offense, Mr. Miyaji, but I don't think you understand my problem...
Mi... ya... *gi* understand problem perfect.
Ah, Daniel-san, come inside! Come inside!
Daniel-san. Huh? Look, look. Hai, hai. Heh heh heh. First American-born Miyagi waiting to be born.
Drink, drink!
""Sergeant Miyagi!""
Yes, sir! Sergeant Miyagi report to kill many jerry Germans, sir!
Sergeant Miyagi.
Yes, sir.""
Regret to inform... wife have...
Complications at birth, sir. Complications. But no doctor come.
Land of Free, Home of Brave.
No doctor come. No doctor come."
Yoda,AD,Eccentric Mentor,"All right, I'll give it a try.
No. Try not. Do... or do not. There is no try.
I don't, I don't believe it.
That is why you fail.
I won't fail you. I'm not afraid.
You will be. You... will... be.
I am wondering, why are you here?
I'm looking for someone.
Looking? Found someone, you have, I would say, hmmm?
Right...
Help you I can. Yes, mmmm.
I don't think so. I'm looking for a great warrior.
Ohhh. Great warrior.
Wars not make one great.
Told you I did. Reckless is he. Now, matters are worse.
That boy is our last hope.
No. There is another.
I can't. It's too big.
Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hmm? Hmm. And well you should not. For my ally is the Force, and a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. Its energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter. You must feel the Force around you; here, between you, me, the tree, the rock, everywhere, yes. Even between the land and the ship.
Yes, run! Yes, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger, fear, aggression; the dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.
Vader... Is the dark side stronger?
No, no, no. Quicker, easier, more seductive.
But how am I to know the good side from the bad?
You will know... when you are calm, at peace, passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, NEVER for attack.
But tell my why I can't...
No, no! There is no ""why"".
Ready are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained. A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. This one a long time have I watched. All his life has he looked away... to the future, to the horizon. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph! Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless!
Why wish you become Jedi?
Well, mostly because of my father, I guess.
Ahh... father. Powerful Jedi was he. Powerful Jedi.
Oh, come on! How can you know my father? You don't even know who I am. Oh, I don't even know what I'm doing here! We're wasting our time!
I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience.
He will learn patience.
Much anger in him... like his father.
Was I any different when you taught me?
There's something not right here... I feel cold. Death.
That place... is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain of evil it is. In you must go.
What's in there?
Only what you take with you.
I want my lamp back. I'm gonna need it to get out of this slimy mudhole.
Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is!
Control, control, you must learn control!
I don't know. I feel like...
Feel like what?
Like we're being watched.
Away put your weapon. I mean you no harm.
Your weapons, you will not need them.
We'll never get it out now!
So certain are you. Always with you what cannot be done. Hear you nothing that I say?
How do you get so big eating food of this kind?
You must unlearn what you have learned.
You must not go!
But Han and Leia will die if I don't.
You don't know that. Even Yoda cannot see their fate.
But I can help them! I feel the Force!
But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you, when you will be tempted by the Dark Side of the Force.
Stopped they must be; on this all depends. Only a fully trained Jedi Knight, with the Force as his ally, will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now - if you choose the quick and easy path as Vader did - you will become an agent of evil.
Patience.
And sacrifice Han and Leia?
If you honor what they fight for? Yes.
If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone. I cannot interfere.
I understand. R2? Fire up the converters.
Luke! Don't give in to hate. That leads to the Dark Side.
Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can.
I will. And I'll return, I promise.
I saw - I saw a city in the clouds.
Friends you have there.
They were in pain...
It is the future you see.
The future?
Will they die?
Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future.
I've got to go to them.
Decide you must, how to serve them best. If you leave now, help them you could; but you would destroy all for which they have fought, and suffered.
How far away is Yoda? Will it take us long to get there?
Not far. Yoda not far. Patience. Soon you will be with him.
Now all I got to is find this Yoda. If he even exists. It's a really strange place to find a Jedi Master. This place gives me the creeps.
Still... there's something familiar about this place.
I don't know, I feel like...
... like we're being watched!
Away put your weapon, I mean you no harm! I am wondering, why are you here?
I'm looking for someone.
Looking? Found someone, you have, I would say! Hmm?
Right...
Help you, I can. Yes, mmm.
I don't think so.
I'm looking for a great warrior.
Oh!
Great warrior!
Wars not make one great, heh heh heh!
Put that down, now we...
Hey! My dinner!
Luke. You must complete the training.
I can't get the vision out of my head. They are my friends and I got to help them.
You must not go.
But, Han and Leia will die if I don't.
You don't know that.
Even Yoda cannot see their fate.
But, I can help them. I feel the force.
But, you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you. Where you will be tempted by the dark side of the force.
Yes! Yes! To Obi Wan, you listen. The cave. Remember your failure with the cave?
But, I've learnt so much since then, Master Yoda. I promise to return and finish what I've begun. You have my word.
It is you and your abilites The Emperor wants. That is why your friends were made to suffer.
That's why I have to go.
Luke. I don't want to lose you to The Emperor, the way I lost Vader.
You won't.
Stop they must be, on this it all depends. Only a fully trained Jedi knight with the force as his allie will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now. If you choose the quick and easy path as Vader did. You will become an agent of evil.
Patience.
And sacrifice Han and Leia?
If you honor what they fight for? Yes!
If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone. I cannot interfeare.
I understand
R2. Fire up the converters.
Luke! Don't give in to hate. That leads to the dark side.
Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can!
I will! And I'll return. I promise!
Told you I did. Reckless is he. Now - matters are worse.
That boy is our last hope.
No! There is another."
Gandalf,AD,Eccentric Mentor,"You cannot pass! I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the Flame of Anor. The dark fire will not avail you, Flame of Udun! Go back to the shadow. You shall not pass!
I wish the ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened.
So do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. There are other forces at work in this world Frodo, besides the will of evil. Bilbo was meant to find the Ring. In which case, you were also meant to have it. And that is an encouraging thought.
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he had the chance.
Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand. Many that live deserve death. Some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them, Frodo? Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment. Even the very wise cannot see all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill before this is over. The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many.
You're late.
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins. Nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to.
Fly, you fools!
Keep it secret. Keep it safe.
Before you came along, we Bagginses were very well thought of.
Indeed?
Never had any adventures or did anything unexpected.
If you're referring to the incident with the Dragon, I was barely involved. All I did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the door.
Whatever you did, you've been officially labeled a disturber of the peace.
We must move on, we cannot linger.
They have taken the bridge and the second hall. We have barred the gates but cannot hold them for long. The ground shakes, drums... drums in the deep. We cannot get out. A shadow lurks in the dark. We can not get out... they are coming.
My dear Frodo. Hobbits really are amazing creatures. You can learn all there is to know about their ways in a month, and yet after a hundred years they can still surprise you.
Hold out your hand, Frodo. It's quite cool.
What do you see? Can you see anything?
Nothing. There's nothing.
Wait... there are markings. It's some form of Elvish, I can't read it.
There are few who can. The language is the that of Mordor, which I will not utter here.
Mordor?
In the common tongue it reads ""One Ring to Rule Them All. One Ring to Find Them. One Ring to Bring Them All and In The Darkness Bind Them.""
His strength returns.
That wound will never fully heal. He will carry it the rest of his life.
And yet, to have come so far, still bearing the Ring, the Hobbit has shown extraordinary resilience to its evil.
It is a burden he should never have had to bear. We can ask no more of Frodo.
Gandalf, the enemy is moving. Sauron's forces are massing in the East; his eye is fixed on Rivendell. And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us. Our list of allies grows thin.
His treachery runs deeper than you know. By foul craft, Saruman has crossed Orcs with goblin men. He's breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard. An army that can move in sunlight and cover great distance at speed. Saruman is coming for the Ring.
This evil cannot be concealed by the power of the Elves. We do not have the strength to withstand both Mordor and Isengard. Gandalf, the Ring cannot stay here. This evil belongs to all of Middle-Earth. They must decide now how to end it. The time of the Elves is over, my people are leaving these shores. Who will you look to when we've gone? The Dwarves? They toil away in caverns, seeking riches. They care nothing for the troubles of others.
It is in Men that we must place our hope.
Men? Men are weak. The Blood of Numenor is all but spent, its pride and dignity forgotten. It is because of Men the Ring survives. I was there, Gandalf. I was there three thousand years ago. I was there the day the strength of Men failed.
Isildur, hurry, follow me.
I led Isildur deep into the fires of Mount Doom, where the Ring was forged, the one place it could be destroyed.
Cast it into the fire! Destroy it!
No.
Isildur!
Isildur kept the Ring. It should have ended that day, but evil was allowed to endure. There's no strength left in the world of Men. They're scattered, divided, leaderless.
There is one who could unite them. One who could reclaim the throne of Gondor.
He turned from that path a long time ago. He has chosen exile.
You shall not pass!
There is one other who knew Bilbo had the Ring. I looked everywhere for the creature Gollum, but the enemy found him first. I don't know how long they tortured him, but through the endless screams and inane babble, they discerned two words:
SHIRE! BAGGINS!
Shire? Baggins? But that would lead them here!
Take it Gandalf!
Take it!
No, Frodo.
You must take it!
You cannot offer me this ring!
I'm giving it to you!
Don't... tempt me Frodo! I dare not take it. Not even to keep it safe. Understand, Frodo. I would use this ring from a desire to do good... But through me, it would wield a power too great and terrible to imagine.
What is this new devilry?
A Balrog. A demon of the ancient world. This foe is beyond any of you. Run!
Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee. Have you been eavesdropping?
I ain't been droppin' no eaves sir, honest. I was just cutting the grass under the window there, if you'll follow me.
A little late for trimming the verge, don't you think?
I heard raised voices.
What did you hear? Speak.
N-nothing important. That is, I heard a good deal about a ring, and a Dark Lord, and something about the end of the world, but... Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me. Don't turn me into anything... unnatural.
We must join with Him, Gandalf. We must join with Sauron. It would be wise, my friend.
Tell me, ""friend"", when did Saruman the Wise abandon reason for madness?
No, thank you. We don't want any more visitors, well-wishers, or distant relations.
And what about very old friends?
Strangers from distant lands, friends of old, you have been summoned here to answer the threat of Mordor. Middle Earth stands upon the brink of destruction; none can escape it. You will unite or you will fall. Each race is bound to this fate, this one doom. Bring forth the ring, Frodo.
So it is true. In a dream, I saw the Eastern sky grow dark. But in the West, a pale light lingered. A voice was crying, ""The doom is near at hand, Isildur's Bane is found.""
Isildur's Bane...
Boromir!
Ash Nazg Durbatuluk, Ash Nazg Gimbatul, Ash Nazg Thrakatuluk, Agh Burzum-ishi Krimpatul.
Never before has anyone dared utter words of that tongue here, in Imladris.
I do not ask for pardon, Master Elrond, for the Black Speech of Mordor may yet be heard in every corner of the West! The Ring is altogether evil.
is a gift. A gift to the foes of Mordor. Why not use this ring? Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor, kept the forces of Mordor at bay. By the blood of our people are your lands kept safe. Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy. Let us use it against him.
You cannot wield it. None of us can. The One Ring answers to Sauron alone. It has no other master.
And what would a Ranger know of this matter?
This is no mere Ranger. He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn. You owe him your allegiance.
Aragorn? This is Isildur's heir?
And heir to the throne of Gondor
Sit down, Legolas.
Gondor has no King. Gondor needs no King.
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.
You have only one choice. The Ring must be destroyed.
Then what are we waiting for?
The ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Gloin, by any craft that we here possess. The ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom. Only there can it be unmade. The ring must be taken deep into Mordor and cast back into the fiery chasm from whence it came. One of you must do this.
One does not simply walk into Mordor. Its black gates are guarded by more than just Orcs. There is evil there that does not sleep. The great Eye is ever watchful. It is a barren wasteland, riddled with fire, ash, and dust. The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume. Not with ten-thousand men could you do this. It is folly.
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said? The ring must be destroyed!
And I suppose you think you're the one to do it?
And if we fail, what then? What happens when Sauron takes back what is his?
I will be dead before I see the Ring in the hands of an Elf! Never trust an Elf!
I think you should leave the ring behind, Bilbo. Is that so hard?
Well, no.
...and yes. Now it comes to it, I don't feel like parting with it. It's mine, I found it. It came to me!
There's no need to get angry.
Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault.
...it's mine... my own... my precious...
Precious? It's been called that before, but not by you.
Oh, what business is it of yours what I do with my own things?
I think you've had that ring quite long enough.
You want it for yourself!
BILBO BAGGINS! Do not take me for some conjuror of cheap tricks! I am not trying to rob you. I'm trying to help you.
Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.
Yes, Gimli, their own masters cannot find them, if their secrets are forgotten.
Why doesn't that surprise me?
I think there's more to this Hobbit than meets the eye.
Frodo suspects something.
Of course he does, he's a Baggins, not some blockheaded Bracegirdle from Hardbottle.
I suppose you think that was terribly clever.
For sixty years, the Ring lay quiet in Bilbo's keeping, prolonging his life, delaying old age. But no longer, Frodo. Evil is stirring in Mordor. The Ring has awoken. It's heard its Master's call.
But he was destroyed. Sauron was destroyed.
No, Frodo. The spirit of Sauron endured. His life force is bound to the Ring and the Ring survived. Sauron has returned. His Orcs have multiplied. His fortress of Barad-Dur is rebuilt in the land of Mordor. Sauron needs only this Ring to cover all the lands with a second darkness. He is seeking it, seeking it, all his thought is bent on it. The Ring yearns to go home, to return to the hand of its Master. They are one, the Ring and the Dark Lord. Frodo, he must never find it.
Always remember, Frodo, the Ring is trying to get back to its master. It wants to be found.
Lead them on, Aragorn. The bridge is near. Do as I say! Swords are no more use here!
There!
He remembered!
No, but the air doesn't smell so foul here. If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose.
Well, what can I tell you? Life in the wide world goes on much as it has these past age, full of its own comings and goings, scarcely aware of the existence of Hobbits... for which I am very thankful.
You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
Two eyes, as often as I can spare them.
Be on your guard. There are older and fouler things than Orcs in the deep places of the world.
There is a fell voice on the air.
It's Saruman!
He's trying to bring down the mountain! Gandalf, we must turn back!
No!
Ash Nazg Durbatuluk, Ash Nazg Gimbatul, Ash Nazg Thrakatuluk, Agh Burzum-ishi Krimpatul.
Never before has any one dared utter the words of that tongue here in Imladris.
I do not ask for pardon, Master Elrond, for the Black Speech of Mordor may yet be heard in every corner of the West.
Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?
Left.
They are one; the ring and the Dark Lord. Frodo, he must never find it.
All right. We'll put it away. We'll keep it hidden, we'll never speak of it again. No one knows it's here, do they?
Do they, Gandalf?
Now, let's see... Ithildin. It mirrors only starlight and moonlight.
It reads: The doors of Durin, Lord of Moria. Speak, friend, and enter.
What d'you suppose that means?
Oh, it's quite simple. If you are a friend, you speak the password, and the doors will open.
There is only one Lord of the Ring, only one who can bend it to his will, and he does not share power.
So you have chosen... death.
What news of the outside world? Tell me everything.
Everything? You are far too eager and curious for a Hobbit. Most unnatural.
Fool of a Took. Throw yourself in next time, and rid us of your stupidity.
I once knew every spell in all the tongues of Elves... Men... and Orcs.
What are you going to do, then?
Knock your head against these doors, Peregrin Took! And if that does not shatter them, and I am allowed a little peace from foolish questions, I will try to find the opening words.
Is it secret? Is it safe?
Let the Ring-bearer decide.
We will go through the mines.
So be it.
The hour is later than you think. Sauron's forces are already moving. The Nine have left Minas Morgul.
The Nine?
They crossed the River Isen on Midsummer's Eve, disguised as riders in black.
They've reached the Shire?
They will find the Ring, and kill the one who carries it.
Gandalf, I'm glad you're back.
So am I, dear boy. So am I.
To the bridge of Khazad-dum.
But we still have time. Time enough to counter Sauron if we act quickly.
Time? What time do you think we have?
Here lies Balin, Son of Fundin, Lord of Moria."
Fin Raziel,AD,Eccentric Mentor,"W-w-i-l-l-o-w! You i-i-i-i-d-iot!
What are you going to look like if this works?
Don't interrupt.
Sorry.
I'm a young beautiful woman.
Concentrate, Willow!
I have Cherlindrea's wand, Bavmorda!
Ouch! What'd you bite me for?
Three drops of your blood must be put in the potion.
Well, you could've warned me!
Patience, Willow!
Courage, Willow!
Farmers! Cherlindrea sends me farmers!
Fin? Fin Raziel?
Who's there? Who calls?
Oh! I'm Willow Ufgood... I am looking for Fin Raziel.
I am Fin Raziel.
No... That's impossible!
It is possible, since I was cursed by Bavmorda.
*Bavmorda.*"
Julie Richman,BR,Valley Girl,"So, when can I see you again?
Gee, Randy... why don't you wait until the end of the evening to say these things?
It's how I feel. It's what I want.
I'm here with you now.
I'll start my diet tomorrow.
You better watch out, because Randy might like the Hollywood lean look.
Yeah, but blimps don't get to go out with Tommy.
Who?
Tommy.
Who?

TOMMY!

TOMMY!

TOMMY!
Fuck him!
Man, he's like tripendicular, ya know?
Like, they're staring right at us.
Gross! Let's move.
Do you think she really does all the stuff she says?
You know, I think she does. I mean, who could make up 'That stuff tastes like Clorox.'?
Where do you work?
At my parents' store.
What do they sell?
Health foods.
That's cool.
Like, it's not cool at all! Like, it's all this stuff that tastes like nothing and it's supposed to be so good for you. Why couldn't they, like, open a Pizza Hut or something?
Yeah, but Tommy can be such a dork, ya know? Like he's got the bod, but his brains are bad news.
But he is bitchin'. You really are so lucky, Julie.
I know, but we've been going together so long now. Like I'm beginning to think I'm a piece of furniture or something, like an old chair!
Oh, bad news!
I definitely need something new.
Why can't you just punish me like Stacey's parents?
Bad karma, dear!"

Oh, wow. I-I never hit anybody before.
Really? Well you did it perfectly.
I didn't even break a nail.

I have something that the other girls didn't have.

No.

Does Elvis talk to you? Does he tell you to do things? Do you see spots?
Merrick, you made a Joke. Are you okay? Do You want to lie down? I know it hurts the first time
I can't believe I'm doing this. I can't believe I'm in a graveyard with a strange man hunting for vampires on a *school night*.
Don't worry. They can't come in unless they're invited.
I already invited 'em.
They're seniors!
Buff, I don't see why we have to invite every single senior.
Because it's the senior dance. It's just a shot in the dark.
You and I are one.
One what? Cute couple? I don't THINK so.
Are you okay?
I can't move my legs.
Why?
'Cause you're sittin' on them.
You left me a message?
You weren't home! Like always.
You broke up with my machine?
You threw a knife at my head!
Yes, I had to show you.
But... you *threw* a *knife* at my *head.*
And you caught it. Only the chosen one could have caught it.
I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy. To bring you... your birthright.
My birthright?
You mean, like a trust fund?
You got a C-plus? I can't believe I cheated off of you.
Excuse me for not knowing about El Salvador, like I'm ever going to Spain anyway.
Three weeks ago, all I thought about was... well I didn't actually think about anything.
None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.
And where are they now? Hello!
Buffy, you're the guy. You are the chosen guy.
Right. I'm the chosen one. And I choose to be shopping.
D'you have any gum?
Excuse much! Rude or anything?
The environment.
The homelesses?
Oh, please.
Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?
Guys. The environment. I'm telling you, it's totally key. The earth is in terrible shape, we could all die, and besides, Sting's doing it.
And you're going to be able to use that to track them.
Great. My secret weapon is PMS. That's just terrific. Thanks for telling me.
It's not a weapon. It's an alert system.
Well, aren't we kung fu? I don't see you out there killing any vampires.
I play my part.
You can play with your part all you want, but it's my neck on the block.
Buffy? What's your sitch? You're acting like the thing from another tax bracket. It's too weird.
Listen, a lot's been going on you guys, okay? And I really wanted to talk to you guys about it. See, um, a couple of weeks ago, I met this guy-...
Oh my god, you're having an affair?
Cool!
Does Jeffrey know?
It's not about that. He's, like, old. He's fifty.

Haven't you guys noticed what's been going on here? The strange things? Have you noticed people disappearing, turning up dead?
What are you talking about?
Weird? You mean like hanging around with that homeless Poke?
Pike.
Eww, you're having an affair with him?
He doesn't look fifty.
Guys, I think reality stepped out of here about five minutes ago.
Is that your van?
Yeah, it was. It's still...
BluaaaahUGH!
Bye-Bye Bobby!
Bye! She thinks my name is Bobby?
It's possible she thinks *my* name's Bobby.
Do you know what time it is?
Uh... around ten?
I *knew* this thing was slow. You pay a fortune for something...
Honey, come on, we're gonna be late!
I thought that look was over.
Well, it's Retro.
Ok Honey, be good.
And stay away from the Jag!
Good bye.

Elle Woods,BR,Valley Girl,"I just don't think that Brooke could've done this. Exercise gives you endorphins. Endorphins make you happy. Happy people just don't shoot their husbands, they just don't.
You got into Harvard Law?
What? Like it's hard?
Ms. Windham, what had you done earlier that day?
I got up. Got a latte. Went to the gym. Got a perm and came home.
Where you got in the shower?
I believe the witness has made it clear that she was in the shower.
Yes, your Honor.
Ms. Windham, had you ever gotten a perm before?
Yes.
Two a year since I was 12. You do the math.
You know, a girl in my sorority, Tracy Marcinco got a perm once. We all tried to talk her out of it. Curls weren't a good look for her. She didn't have your bone structure, but thankfully that same day she entered the Pheta Delta Phi wet t-shirt contest where she was completely hosed to down from head to toe...
Objection, why is this relevant?
I have a point, I promise.
Then make it.
Chutney, why is it Tracy Marcinco's curls were ruined when she got hosed down?
Because they got wet.
Exactly. Because isn't the first cardinal rule of perm maintenance that you're forbidden to wet your hair for at least 24 hours after getting a perm at the risk of deactivating the immonium thygocolate?
Yes.
And wouldn't somebody who had, say, 30 perms before in their life be well aware of this rule, and if in fact you weren't washing your hair as I suspect you weren't because your curls are still intact, wouldn't you have heard the gunshot, and if in fact you had heard the gunshot Brooke Windham wouldn't have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs. Which means you would have had to found Brooke Windham with a gun in her hand to make your story plausible, isn't that right?
She's my age! Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone who was your age?
You, however, Chutney had time to hide the gun after you shot your father.
I didn't mean to shoot him!
I thought it was YOU walking through the door!
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Balliff, take the witness into custody, where she will be charged for the murder of Joseph Windham. Case dismissed. Mrs. Windham, you're free to go.
Thank you, your honor.
Nice outfit.
Oh, I like your outfit too, except when I dress up as a frigid bitch, I try not to look so constipated.
Don't stomp your little last season Prada shoes at me, honey.
These aren't last season!
He's gay! Enrique is gay!
I can't believe you just called me a butthead. I don't think anybody has called me a butthead since the 9th grade.
Maybe not to your face.
I feel comfortable using legal jargon in everyday life.
I object!
Excuse me.
Why didn't you call me? We spent a beautiful night together and I haven't heard from you since.
I'm sorry?
Sorry for what? For breaking my heart, or for giving me the greatest pleasure I've ever known and just taking it away?
Both?
Well, forget it. I've spent too much time crying over you.
So, when did you wanna go out?
... and that's why you should vote for me. Elle Woods: future lawyer for the class of 2004.
She does have a 4.0 from CULA and she got a 179 on LSATs.
Fashion major?
Well sir we've never had one before and aren't we always looking for diversity?
Her list of extra-curricular activities is impressive.
She was in a Ricky Martin video.
Clearly, she's interested in music.
She also designed a line of faux-fur panties for her sorority's charity project.
Uh huh, she's a friend to the animals as well as a philanthropist.
Elle Woods.
Welcome to Harvard.
For that matter, any masturbatory emissions, where the sperm is clearly not seeking an egg, could be termed reckless abandonment.
You've just won your case.
Honey, you were First Runner-Up at the ""Miss Hawaiian Tropics"" contest. Why are you going to throw that all away?
Going to Harvard is the only way I'm going to get the love of my life back.
Oh, sweetheart, you don't need law school. Law school is for people who are boring and ugly and serious. And you, button, are none of those things.
And last week I saw Cameron Diaz at Fred Segal, and I talked her out of buying this truly heinous angora sweater. Whoever said orange was the new pink was seriously disturbed.
Hi. I'm Elle Woods and this is Bruiser Woods. We're both Gemini vegetarians.
But if I'm going to be a partner in a law firm by the time I'm 30, I need a boyfriend who's not such a complete bonehead.
Did you see him? He's probably still scratching his head.
Yeah, which must be a nice vacation for his balls.
Oh Warner, do you remember when we spent those four amazing hours in the hot tub together after winter formal?
Uhh, ye... no?
Well this is so much better than that! Excuse me, I have some shopping to do.
Pooh bear, just get in the car.
No.
You're gonna ruin your shoes.
Okay.
You're breaking up with me because I'm too... blonde?
Well, no. That's not entirely true...
Then what? My boobs are too big?
Here, you're gonna need this.
Your scrunchie?
My LUCKY scrunchie. It helped me pass Spanish.
You passed Spanish because you gave Professor Montoya a lap dance after the final.
Yeah... Luckily!
Are you one of my lawyers?
Sort of.
Well thank God one of you has a brain.
Is she as pretty as you?
She could use some mascara and some serious highlights, but she's not completely unfortunate looking.
This is what I need to become.
What? Practically deformed?
No, a law student.
So, if you don't know an answer they're just gonna kick you out.
So you have Stromwell, huh?
Yes. Did she do that to you too?
No, but she did make me cry once... not in class I waited until I got back to my room, but yeah she'll kick you right in the balls, or wherever.
Don't ask.
Wasn't gonna.
You know, I'm still shocked that you didn't give Callahan the alibi.
It wasn't my alibi to tell.
I know, I thought that was very... classy of you.
I don't need back-ups. I'm going to Harvard.
Well then, you'll need excellent recommendations from your professors.
Okay.
And a heck of an admissions essay.
Right.
And at least a 175 on your LSATs.
I once had to judge a tighty-whitey contest for Lambda Kappa Pi. Trust me, I can handle anything.
Because I'm not a Vanderbilt, suddenly I'm white trash? I grew up in Bel Air, Warner. Across the street from Aaron Spelling. I think most people would agree that's a lot better than some stinky old Vanderbilt.
I was getting...
liposuction.
I'm sorry, what?
Liposuction.
What?
LIPOSUCTION!
OH MY GOD!
I KNOW!
NO...
Yes! I know I'm a fraud, but its not like normal women could have this ass! If anyone found out about this, I would be ruined!
You must understand me, Elle... I had just lost a husband...
I would rather go to jail than to lose my reputation!
Don't worry. Your secret is safe with me.
Thank you, Elle.
The rules of hair care are simple and finite. Any Cosmo girl would have known.
Bend and snap.
Excuse me, I'm sorry... are you here to see me?
No, silly. I go here!
I promised her, and I can't break the bonds of sisterhood.
Screw sisterhood! This is a murder investigation! Not some scandal at the sorority house!
It has come to my attention that the maintenance staff is switching our toilet paper from Charmin... to generic. All those opposed to chafing, please say ""Aye"".
Aye.
Is that low-viscosity rayon? With a half-loop top stitching on the hem?
Of course. It's one of a kind.
It's impossible to use a half-loop stitching on low-viscosity rayon. It would snag the fabric. And you didn't just get it in - I saw it in the June Vogue a year ago. So if you're trying to sell it to me for full price, you've picked the wrong girl.
She told me I look like Britney Spears! Why would she say that if she doesn't like me?
All people see when they look at me is blonde hair and big boobs.
No more boring suits or pantyhose, I'm trying to be somebody I'm not.
I'm reading about the LSATs.
My cousin had that once. Apparently you get a really bad rash on your...
Uh. I'm sorry. I just hallucinated.
How was your first class?
Oh, it was okay, except for this horrible preppy girl who tried to make me look bad in front of the professor, but no biggie.
Hey, well, don't you look like a walking felony.
Thanks, you're so sweet.
That's great, Paulette. Is that the only interaction you two have ever had?
No! Sometimes I say ""okay"" instead of ""fine.""
This is gonna be just like senior year, except for funner!
You know a Delta Nu would never sleep with a man who wears a thong.
Never!
I just liked to watch him change the filter.
Pooh-bear, you're not serious enough...
Well, I'm serious about this, Warner.
No. I mean, I'm sorry but, you're never going to be smart enough for lessons in law.
I'm never going to be good enough for you, am I?
Warner, what kind of shoes are these?
Umm... black ones.
Here it is!
It's pink...
Oh! And it's scented! I think it gives it a little something extra, don't you think? Okay, well, see you next class!"
Karen,BR,Valley Girl,"So, who do you think wore those panties you were sniffing? Kevin or Marcus?
Gomez, l told you. l was looking for DNA...
Oh, yeah.
What are you laughing at, ''Denzel''? ''Oh, what a beautiful chocolate man!'' hahahaha
You guys got some work to do?"
Gemma Honeycutt,F,Brainless Beauty,"Well, well, well. If it isn't the Ukrainian sidekick.
I don't think of myself that way. I am the lead character in my own story.
It's difficult to maintain enthusiasm for your leadership when you keep getting beat up by that old man.
Nigel, I'm so sorry, but she's gotta learn that there's better ways to get attention than acting like a bimbo.
Like what?"
Matt Mateo,F,Brainless Beauty,"I'm bisexual.
Puh-lease! I went to a bar mitzvah once. That doesn't make me Jewish.
I've never tried communism, but I know I wouldn't like that. It's the same thing. Or grits.
This is about trimesters.
Yeah, I know. I want her to go back to school too."
Shelley Darlingson,F,Brainless Beauty,"The eyes are the nipples of the face.
This is not a brothel.
Oh, I'm not looking to make soup.
I gotta meet this freakin' bird!
Dear Shelley. Oh my gosh, that's me! Wait there's more!
This is Harmony.
Harmony.
And Carrie Mae.
Carrie Mae.
And that's Joanne over there.
Joanne.
What is that? Is it like a Yoda, type of thing, I mean it's cool, fun, but?
Oh, it's just this thing I do to remember people's names.
Natalie.
Wow, you hired the exorcist, that's great!
Good morning Pooter! You're looking dapper!
Manhole. I like that word. Manhole.
Shelley knows how to meet guys, hence, we will learn how to meet guys.
Yeah, hence!
Instead of the Mahi-Mahi, can I get just the one Mahi, because I'm not that hungry?
We could tie our shoes together, our tennis shoes, and we could throw them over telephone wires. Because I see that everywhere and it seems like people would have fun doing that. Like, how hard can you throw? You know what I mean? Like how - what are you -

Or we could go to a club.
Oh, wait here for a second, I think I dropped some money over here the other day. I just don't know wherever it could be. Maybe it's over here by this manhole...
Haaaa-ARGH! That is fucking hot!
So, are you a Zeta?
Oh! I wish.
Yeah. I do too 'cause Zeta would be my favorite hizzity hang.
Well, she is not a Zeta because she's our new hizzity house mother. She'll be hizzy-tizzy - - She'll be here all the time.
You're hiring me?
Why are they acting like that?
Boys just being boys. Thank goodness!
I don't think he likes me. He didn't fall for any of my tricks.
That's impossible. Your tricks always work.
I did sexy. I did other guys want me. I worked every angle in the book but, I don't know, he just stared.
What if Oliver is one of those guys who wants to have, like, a conversation with a girl before he hooks up with her.
He's gay?
Kindness is just love with its work boots on.
God, you need to go to the eye doctor!
I did. That's where I got my glasses.
They're kicking me out?
Maybe it's because of your age.
But I'm 27.
But that's 59 in Bunny Years.
You given any thought to who you might be voting for?
I definitely won't listen to what Simon says, he is just so mean. I usually always agree with Paula and Randy.
Oh, you meant the president.
Sweet balls!
My heart is pounding like a nail!
Ooh, what was that?
oh, yeah that happens like, ten times a day.
Oh, well... at least you've still got T and A!
My allergic reaction made me feel beautiful.
I'm an expert at parties and boys! I'm a bunny! Men write to me from prison, sometimes even in their own blood, which I think is theirs, but I don't know, I'm really nervous because I really want to help.
A-a bunny? You mean, like, centerfold?
Oh, bless your heart, no, just a few pictorials, like ""Girls from the Midwest"" and ""Girls with GEDs.""
Don't mess with me. Don't mess with Phi Iota Mu.
Man! Someone needs a mani-pedi-massage combo PRONTO.
Natalie, Colby was following you around like a puppy dog. Do you guys think you'll, you know...
No. I do not think, you know, THAT.
That? Natalie, are you a virgin?
No. Am I a virgin? No.
You're a virgin!
Shhh. It's like an amphitheater in here.
That's it. Oh my gosh. We have to have an Aztec party. We always wanted to have one at the mansion but we could never find a virgin to sacrifice.
It's been so nice meeting you.
But...
... so nice
Keep doing that. Keep doing that. Make love to the camera.
I saw that in Austin Powers.
Yeah. Work it. Think, really sexy witch. Are you a good witch or a bad witch?
A good witch.
I think you're a bad witch.
Oh!
Oh! I bet the house that falls on you is gonna be a sexy house.
Work it. Work it. You're like a supermodel, except more pregnant.
No, it's for senior citizens, you know, an old folks... for old people.
I know lots of old men - hairy and not-hairy. But I don't mean to brag."
Brace Channing,F,Brainless Beauty,Here's a rememberence of our last date.
Marcia Brady,F,Brainless Beauty,"Marcia, I may be able to use you as a model, but first you'll have to do a little work on yourself.
You mean like walking with a book on my head?
No, I mean like cutting that mousy hair, capping those teeth, and losing about 30 pounds, my little sausage. How do you feel about breast implants?
Cut my hair?
I suppose you don't want to go out with me now, huh?
Oh, of course I do. It's not your nose I'm after.
I've got it! We could enter that Search For The Stars contest! First prize is twenty thousand dollars!
That's a great idea, Marcia!
Great idea, Marcia!
Am I invisible? Do I not have a voice? I had that idea two days ago!
Oh come on, Jan.
Marcia, I think I just felt your tongue in my mouth.
It's called a French kiss, Charlie.
Um, Marcia, I gotta go. Uh something suddenly came up.
I saw a sign at school today for a Search For The Stars contest. First prize is exactly twenty thousand dollars.
Oh sure Jan, like we'd really win.
But Jan, you don't have friends. You're just jealous Jan.
Jan, what are you doing?
Go back to sleep Cindy!
Jan don't. Marcia's hair is so beautiful.
Exactly. That's why I'm gonna make alot of money when I sell it.


Jan, what are you doing?
Oh Marcia, I love your hair!
What a groovy hairdo!
Oh, you're so beautiful!
No! She was supposed to look bad! No! No!
What a horrible dream.
Doug! I think I just felt your tongue in my mouth.
It's called a french kiss.
But I thought you were from Nebraska!
Now I'll never be a teen model.
Oh those are pretty pictures, what have you modeled for?
Guess.
Are you a Breck girl?
No, Guess Jeans.
Levi's? Wrangler? Osh Kosh B'Gosh?
Noreen, is that you?
Oh, sorry, I thought that was my leg.
Marcia, got a minute?
Forget it Doug. Even with a swollen nose, I can still smell a rat.
And that's why I called this meeting.
Greg, what are we going to do?
Yeah, if we don't raise $20,000 in one week, we'll have to move.
And go to a new school.
And make new friends.
But Jan, you don't have any friends.
Charlie asked me to the dance, and I said yes. Then Doug asked me to the dance, and I said yes to him too. What am I going to do?
Well, you just tell the guy you don't wanna go with, something suddenly came up.
And that works?
Sure. Girls say it to me all the time."
Chris,F,Brainless Beauty,"What am I afraid of her for? She's no rocket scientist.
Well, actually, she is a rocket scientist.
Aren't you going to kill me? The guys said...
Oh, ordinarily, yeah, but not today.
How come?
Because yesterday... she didn't. But today... she does.
So you finally got a sense of humor about your nose.
It's hypnotic, isn't it?
It's huge! It's enormous! It's gigantic! I mean, they said it was big, but I didn't expect it to be BIG!
Man, whatever you do, don't stare.
Look, I'm not gonna stare, come on.
None of us would. But you get there, and you feel yourself not staring.
Then you think, ""it's obvious I'm not staring."" So you look, and you think, ""I'm staring."" So you say, ""this is ridiculous,"" and you take a GOOD LOOK. And you think, ""I'm looking at a man who, when he washes his face, loses the bar of soap.""
Thanks guys, all right.
Don't say we didn't warn you.
Your breasts, they're like melons. No, no, they're like pillows. Can I fluff your pillows?
Do you know the phrase carpe diem?
It's, it's fish, fish bait, right?
Hey, did that copy of 'Being and Nothingness,' by Jean...
Jean-Paul Sartre? Yes, it did. I got it right here! It's all paid for.
Great! Okay, thanks a lot.
De rien. Il n'y a pas de quoi.
All right, okay...
It ain't nothing, bro!
""... therefore my body is a conscious structure of my consciousness...""
Yeah. Thanks, Chris. I was too embarrassed to go in there and ask for it myself.
A little light reading, huh, Andy?
Let's take a look at that letter...
I think it's really good!
""Dear Roxanne, how's it going? Want to have a drink sometime? If you do, check this box.""
Reach out your hand.
My hand, out reaching to - car 3, car3! Proceed to the 279.
What?
So why did you say those things?
Tell her you were afraid.
Because I was afraid.
Of me? Afraid of what?
Tell her you were afraid of words.
What?
Words.
Because I was afraid of worms, Roxanne! Worms!"
Brad,F,Brainless Beauty,"Hey you weren't supposed to be here for another 4 hours... What happened to your face?
same thing...! Your face is going to look like my face if I ever... ! Actually, your face is going to look worse than mine if...
You had sex with my wife again?
Well, I figured we already did it once, so what's the big deal, right? Besides, I'm not going to charge you.
You're not going to charge... You *are* going to charge me and I am going to pay you, because you are not going to have sex with my wife for free, all right?"
Jack Bartlett,F,Brainless Beauty,"Who would you be, Count Chocula or Trix Rabbit?
Uhhh Trix.
Me too. God I love this lady!"
Maggie Feller,F,Brainless Beauty,"I carry your heart with me. I carry it in my heart. I am never without it. Anywhere I go, you go, my dear. And whatever is done by only me... is your doing, my darling. I fear no fate... for you are my fate, my sweet. I want no world, for, beautiful... you are my world, my true. Here is the deepest secret no one knows. Here is the root of the root... and the bud of the bud... and the sky of the sky of a tree called life... which grows higher than the soul can hope... or mind can hide. It is the wonder that's keeping the stars apart. I carry your heart. I carry it in my heart.
The art of losing isn't hard to master; so many things seem... f... filled... with the intent to be lost that their loss is no disaster. Lose something every day. Accept the fluster of lost door keys, the hour badly spent. The art of losing isn't hard to master. I lost two cities, lovely ones. And, vaster, some realms I owned, two rivers, a continent. I miss them, but it wasn't a disaster. Even losing you... the joking voice, a gesture I love... I shan't have lied. It's evident the art of losing's not too hard to master though it may look like... Write it!... like disaster.
Shoes like these should not be locked in a closet! They should be living a life of scandal, and passion, and getting screwed in an alleyway by a billionaire while his frigid wife waits in the limo thinking that he just went back into the bar to get his cellphone. These are cute too.
Please tell me you just made that up.
Look, if you're not going to wear them... don't buy them! Leave them for someone who's going to get something out of them.
I get something out of them! When I feel bad I like to treat myself. Clothes never look any good... food just makes me fatter... shoes always fit.
I don't know what's wrong with your girls. My Marcia never uses the word vagina!
My Marcia doesn't even have a vagina!
Oh, My Marcia has a vagina alright, but My Marcia's vagina is made of solid 24 karat gold!
My Marcia's vagina is so perfect, it's in a museum!
Why can't I just stay mad at you?
Because we're a pair. Like... Sonny and Cher.
They broke up.
But they remained quite close.
Remember Honey Bun? How long did we have him for?
A day.
That was a good day.
I liked you... I really liked you. She won't even remember your name. Probably can't even spell it.
Can you, Maggie? Come on, sound it out. Juh-imm. Jim. Oh, she's pretty, this one... but real stupid.
Shut up, you fat pig!
Did you honestly just say, ""Fat pig""? You're my sister... and the best you can do is ""fat pig""?
Get out of my life!
You know, I came over here, and I was noticing you, and well, wow. You're like... cute!
Darling, you're like twelve!
Your 10-year high school reunion. Everybody wants to make a good impression and I was making mine on Ted, Tad?, whatever...
It is the wonder that's keeping the stars apart. I carry your heart. I carry it in my heart.
What are you doing here?
I live here. What are you doing here?
You live here? In an old folks home?
It's a Retirement Community for Active Seniors.
Wrong dresser. It's in the sock drawer.
What?
My cash. That's what you were looking for, right? That's what you want.
No! god!
Oh, well. I guess after being absent for some 20-odd years I can't expect you to want to have a relationship with me. How much?
How much what?
*Money*, Maggie! How much *money* were you hoping to get from me?
...I don't know.
Yes, you do.
I want to go to New York. Maybe act. I think I'd be good at it.
humph, clearly!... How much do you need?
Three-grande.
*That* you would not have found in the sock drawer... How much do you have?
I won't give you three-thousand dollars, but I'll do this; they need help down at the assisted living center. You get that job, stop loafing around here like a princess...
... and I will match what you earn, penny for penny.
... You would do that?
... Why?
Because I'm your Grandmother."
Chelsea Deardon,G,Broken Bird,"Do you always cross-examine people?
Only when they lie to me."
Mad Hatter,G,Broken Bird,"Have I gone mad?
I'm afraid so. You're entirely bonkers. But I'll tell you a secret. All the best people are.
Sometimes I believe in as many as six impossible things before breakfast.
That is an excellent practice.
You used to be much more...""muchier."" You've lost your muchness.
There is a place. Like no place on Earth. A land full of wonder, mystery, and danger! Some say to survive it: You need to be as mad as a hatter.
Which luckily I am.
Have you any idea why a raven is like a writing desk?
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: All mimsy were the borogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe.
Sorry, what was that?
What was what?
The Jabberwock, with eyes aflame, Jaws that bait and claws that catch, Beware the Jabberwock, my son, The frumious Bandersnatch He took his vorpal sword in hand The vorpal blade went snicker-snack He left it dead, and with its head He went galumphing back. Its all about you, you know
I'm not slaying anything. I don't slay, so put it out of your mind
...Mind?
Wait! You Cant leave me here!
You don't slay? Do you have any idea what the Red Queen has done? You don't slay.
I couldn't if i wanted to.
You're not the same as you were before You were much more...""muchier"" You've lost your ""muchness""
My ""muchness""?
In there.
This is impossible.
Only if you believe it is.
Your carriage, my lady.
A hat?
Of course. Anyone can go by horse or rail, but the absolute best way to travel is by hat. Have I made a rhyme?
If you're hiding her, you will lose your heads.

Already lost them.
Where is Alice?
I've been considering words that start with the letter M. Moron. Mutiny. Murder. Mmm-malice.
Well, we're looking for an A word right now. Where is Alice?
When that day comes I shall futterwacken... vigorously.
We're looking for the girl called Alice.
Speaking of the Queen, here's a little song we used to sing in her honor:
, , :
""Twinkle twinkle little bat, how I wonder where you're at. Up...""
, , :
""Twinkle twinkle little bat, how I wonder where you're at. Up...""
, , :
""Twinkle twinkle little bat, how I wonder where you're at. Up...""
If you're hiding her you'll lose your heads.
*Already lost them.* All together now!
, , :
""Up above the world you fly, like a tea tray in the sky. Twinkle twinkle...""
, , :
""Up above the world you fly, like a tea tray in the sky. Twinkle twinkle...""
, , :
""Up above the world you fly, like a tea tray in the sky. Twinkle twinkle...""
Well. The entire world is falling to ruins and poor Cheshire's off his tea.
Down with the bloody Red Queen!
'Twas brillig/and the slithy toves/did gyre and gimbel in the wabe/all mimsy were the borogoves/and the mome raths outgrabe.
Rise up against the bloody red queen.

, , , , , :
Down with the bloody big head!
, , , , , :
Down with the bloody big head!
, , , , , :
Down with the bloody big head!
, , , , , :
Down with the bloody big head!
, , , , , :
Down with the bloody big head!
, , , , , :
Down with the bloody big head!
You could stay.
What an idea. What a mad, crazy, wonderful idea.
... But I can't.
Hatter, why *is* a raven like a writing desk?
I haven't the slightest idea.
Why is it you're always too small or too tall?

You have a regrettably large head! I would very much like to hat it!
How would you like to have your head hacked off?

Stop that.
I'd like to keep it on.
Suit yourself. As long as I can get at your neck.
Yes, yes-but you would have to be half-mad to dream me up.
I'm investigating things that begin with the letter M.
What is the hatter with me?
What a regrettably large head you have. I would very much like to hat it. I used to hat The White Queen, you know. Her head was so small.
It's tiny. It's a pimple of a head.
Sometimes I believe in as many as six impossible things before breakfast.
That is an excellent practice.
Six impossible things. Count them Alice. One. There's a potion that can make you shrink. Two. And a cake that can make you grow. Three. Animals can talk. Four, Alice. Cats can disappear. Five. There's a place called Wonderland. Six. I can slay the Jabberwocky."
Nicole Oakley,G,Broken Bird,"You're crazy...
...and you're beautiful.
Why do you hate me so much? How could you tell the only person in the world that I love, that I care about so much, how could you tell him to stay away from me? Do you think that the only thing I'll ever do to someone is screw them up? That I'm not worth loving?
There are millions of people in this world, but in the end it all comes down to one. I still panic sometimes, forget to breathe, but I know that there's something beautiful in my imperfections; the beauty that he held up for me to see. The strength that I will never be able to say.
You can be anywhere where when your life begins. You meet the right person and anything is possible.
Come to get me into trouble again?
Nah. We're off duty. We're not troublemakers, we're innocent. Don't we look innocent together?
What kind of daughter are you?
Not yours.
Thank god for that.
We forgot to wear our blue.
Shit. I forgot to wear anything.
You can be anywhere when your life begins. When the future opens up in front of you. And you may not even realize it at first, but it's already happening.
I want to be good for you.
I'm seventeen, I'm supposed to get out of control."
Annie Newton,G,Broken Bird,"Nick, I wanted to do one good thing.
You did, Annie. You did. You saved me. You saved me.
Who's the broken one now?
You are. Still you.
What did you say?
Still you.
Come here little man. Do you know what I want more than anything? Don't be like me... I ruin everything I touch.
Did he eat at all tonight?
Victor, you hungry?

See?
Get off your bony ass, and make him something to eat!
Ma'am, I'm gonna have to ask you to step out of the car.
I'm sorry, I can't. I've got to be somewhere.
You don't have to look for me anymore.
Nick didn't do it.
...You're lying.
Don't believe me? He didn't do it. I lied to save my own ass... he was supposed to be on a plane. You killed Nick for nothing!
If anything happens to Victor... I'll come back here, and I will kill you.
They're going to catch you, Annie!
Never! Never...
She heard me? She heard me... you heard me!"
Nina Sayers,G,Broken Bird,"I had the craziest dream last night. I was dancing the White Swan.
What's she doing here?
He made me your alternate."
Sharpay Evans,BB,Prima Donna,"I... don't know what's going on here, but in any event, it is far too late, and we have not got a pianist.
Well, that's show biz.
We'll sing without a piano.
Oh no you won't. Pianist here, Ms. Darbus.
You *really* don't want to do that.
Oh yes, I *really* do.
Ready on stage!
Oh!
Now *that's* show biz!
I told you not to do the jazz square.
It's a crowd favorite, everyone loves a good jazz square.
Sharpay! Forget about the rest of us, how about the fact that your brother has worked extremely hard on this show?
Oh boo-hoo, he'll be in the show, he'll do his celebrity impersonations. Don't lecture me about Ryan, given the way you've been interfering with Troy's future.
What?
You've gotten him written up by Fulton for sneaking on the golf course and swimming after hours. I had to step in just to save Troy's job.
I'm not interested in what you think you're doing for Troy, that's between you and him. But you're messing with my friends and my summer and that's not okay with me.
You don't like the fact that I won.
What's the prize? Troy?
The Star Dazzle award? You have to go through all this just to get either one? No thanks, Sharpay. You're very good at a game that I don't want to play. So, I'm done here. But you better step away from the mirror long enough to check the damage that will always be right behind you.
*Girls*!
Hey! What do you mean you're done here? I mean, you can't quit.
Us working together sounded good, but plans change and people change. The club talent show was a big deal for Sharpay and evidently for your future, so it's cool, just make it happen, wear your new Italian shoes.
Hey, I'm still me.
Blowing off your friends, missing dates, if that's you, then it's good to know.
No, no, no. I was only doing that because I'm working on the scholarship thing and you know that.
But if along the way you act like someone you're not, pretty soon that's who you become.
I meant what I said about movies, and summer, and just being together.
I'm sure you did, at the time. But I also meant what I said: that I want to remember this summer, but not like this, Troy.
Oh, come here, Kelsi. I have a summer job for you, at our country club. Our rehearsal pianist is evidently moving.
Or hiding.
Pardon?
Sounds great!
What about our song? What about Humu Humu?
Change of plans.
What am I supposed to do with my tiki warrior outfit?
Save it for Halloween, go to a luau, sell it online, I don't know! But in the meantime keep an eye on those Wildcats. If they're planning to be in the show... which I doubt once they hear about Troy and me... I don't want any surprises. Oh and don't worry, I'll find a song for you somewhere in the show. Or the next show.
Really? Don't strain yourself, slick.
Entertainers are so temperamental.
Transpose!
Going to movies, listening to music, and golly, Troy! I have first aid training! Aha-ha-ahah oh please.
Gabriella. I understand you've moved every summer for the past five years, and I'd hate to think today is
... goodbye.
No worries. My mom promised I'm here until graduation next year.
...Bless Mom's little heart.
My life is over! I've been a good girl! I've never lied... except when necessary. I've always bought my parents expensive gifts... using their credit card, of course. But I don't deserve this humiliation!
It's out with the old, and in with the new. Good-bye, clouds of grey, hello, skies of blue. A dip in the pool, a trip to the spa. Endless days in my chaise, the whole world according to moi!
Excuse me.
Thank you.

You, go, do. I want fabulous, that is my simple request. All things fabulous, bigger, and better and best. I need something inspiring to help me get along. I need a little fabulous, is that so wrong?
Hey! Why did you switch songs?
Switch songs? What?
Yeah, Ryan said...
Bolton!
But I didn't learn a new song.
Exactly.
What was the first thing you said to me when I started working here?
Bring me more iced tea?
I want them out!
But your mother specifically said...
Oh, don't mention that backstabbing Yogini to me! If you can't fire them, make them wanna quit!
I told you to hire Troy Bolton, not the entire East High student body!
What are you doing here?
I'm the new lifeguard.
I said keep an eye on them. Not turn them into the cast of Grease.
Pretty cool, huh?
Do you want us to lose the Star Dazzle award to a bunch of... dishwashers?
Us? Well, I guess that's showbiz.
When did you become... one of them?
You know, I'll take that as a compliment. But you and Troy have a good show, sis.
Oh. We plan to.
There you are! Thank goodness you've come to your senses! Plug in the volcano. Humu Humu's back on.
Enjoy your pineapple on your own, sis. I'm not doing the show.
What? Put some fresh batteries in your tiki warrior outfit and let's get going.
Took your advice. Sold it online. You've always wanted the spotlight. Now you've got it. Break a leg. Ma.
Ryan, who is the absolute primo boy at East High?
I'd say Troy Bolten has that category pretty much locked up, don't you think?
And East High's primo girl?
Just answer the question!
Gosh, uh... you?
Troy... Sharpay. Sharpay... Troy. Sharpay...
Shar.
It just makes sense.
Evidently not to Troy.
But it's Summer, Ry.
*Everything* changes.
How's your show going?
How's it going? This show makes the captain of the Titanic look like he won the lottery.
Hey, Kelsi's got some great new ideas to spice up the talent show...
Uh-huh, I'm thrilled.
Uh, that new duet that Troy and Gabriella sang? I need it
Actually, it's not available.
Repeat?
Well, it's something I wrote for Troy and Gabriella just in case they wanted...
You're an employee, not a fairy godmother. Let's have it.
The Midsummer's Night Talent Show means something to me and to my family. Those Wildcats will turn it into a farce!
Your brother is one of *those* Wildcats, I'm told.
Oh, don't you mention that traitor to us!
.Employee involvement in the show is a tradition here.
Traditions change. My parents have important guests coming. We'll need *every* employee working the party, and not on stage.
Pardonnez-moi, *but*, we're not just talking about employees. We're talking about *your* classmates. You might want to think this one out.
All right.
Done. Now do it!
Ryan, it might be wonderful if Troy participates in our Talent Show.
What? If he sings with Gabriella then our whole show is gonna be the 'Troy and Gabriella Show'.
I *love* your shoes.
You like 'em?
I really do.
I bought them in New York. I have them in nine colors.
Girls, again from the top!
So maybe today we could have our...
Troy!
Ah, what time is your lunch break?
Troy!
I think we were meant to sing together, don't you?
I need some air.
You are a good guy, Troy. And actually, right now I think I like you better then I like myself.
Did I just say that?
What do you mean you're not doing the show?
Exactly that.
We're singing a duet, Troy! A duet means two people! Well mostly me in this case but whatever! Duet!
I'm an employee. Employees aren't allowed in the show.
No, no, no, no. No, no. You're an honorary member.
Not any more. I asked Fulton for my kitchen job back.
What?
Sharpay, I don't like the way you've been treating my friends. And I don't like the way I've way I've been treating them either, so I'm doing something about it.
An entire table of University boosters are coming to see you, thanks to me.
So I'll be their waiter. They'll be thrilled.
Troy, Troy. This could change your life!
I'm more interested in what my friends think of me. And what I think of myself.
Oh, we can hold hands around the campfire some other time! Right now we got a show to do.
No. You've got a show to do. I got a kitchen to clean.
Tell Pumpkin if she worries too much, she'll get frown lines.
I told her twice.
Oh... Namaste!
How can you be thinking of food at a time like this?
Maybe cuz its lunch time?

It's gonna be a night... to remember!
Surprise!
Hey, Troy, when's the big game?
Yesterday.
Well, good luck. Toodles!
We'll call it, Senior Year!
Genius.
I heard Kelsi is writing something amazing for Troy and Gabriella.
A song, most likely.
Oh, perfect! Go for it! Save the day, whoopee!
But... you were so loyal. And sweet.
That's called acting. You should try it sometime.
Sharpay Evans, you're wearing the wrong dress.
Wait a minute. Mrs. D says there's only one scholarship, there's two of us.
We're twins. They're gonna have to take us both.
You're really stressing me out. I need to breathe. And I don't know what Ryan is doing. He's doing some kind of yoga Fosse thing."
Margo Channing,BB,Prima Donna,"Fasten your seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy night!
Bill's thirty-two. He looks thirty-two. He looked it five years ago, he'll look it twenty years from now. I hate men.
Funny business, a woman's career - the things you drop on your way up the ladder so you can move faster. You forget you'll need them again when you get back to being a woman. That's one career all females have in common, whether we like it or not: being a woman. Sooner or later, we've got to work at it, no matter how many other careers we've had or wanted. And in the last analysis, nothing's any good unless you can look up just before dinner or turn around in bed, and there he is. Without that, you're not a woman. You're something with a French provincial office or a book full of clippings, but you're not a woman. Slow curtain, the end.
So many people know me. I wish I did. I wish someone would tell me about me.
You're Margo, just Margo.
And what is that, besides something spelled out in light bulbs, I mean - besides something called a temperament, which consists mostly of swooping about on a broomstick and screaming at the top of my voice? Infants behave the way I do, you know. They carry on and misbehave - they'd get drunk if they knew how - when they can't have what they want, when they feel unwanted or insecure or unloved.
Nice speech, Eve. But I wouldn't worry too much about your heart. You can always put that award where your heart ought to be.
Birdie, you don't like Eve, do you?
You looking for an answer or an argument?
An answer.
No.
Why not?
Now you want an argument.
I shall never understand the weird process by which a body with a voice suddenly fancies itself as a mind. Just when exactly does an actress decide they're HER words she's speaking and HER thoughts she's expressing?
Usually at the point where she has to rewrite and rethink them, to keep the audience from leaving the theatre!
Lloyd, honey, be a playwright with guts. Write me one about a nice normal woman who just shoots her husband.
I'll admit I may have seen better days, but I'm still not to be had for the price of a cocktail, like a salted peanut.
You bought the new girdles a size smaller, I can feel it.
Something maybe grew a size larger.
When we get home you're going to get into one of those girdles and act for two and a half hours.
I couldn't get into the girdle in two and a half hours.
I detest cheap sentiment.
A Hollywood movie star just arrived.
Shucks, and I sent my autograph book to the cleaner.
You know, there isn't a playwright in the world who could make me believe this would happen between two adult people. Goodbye, Margo.
Bill? Where are you going? To find Eve?
That suddenly makes the whole thing believable.
There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know she ordered domestic gin by mistake?
The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests. They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns!
This is my cue to take you in my arms and reassure you. But I'm not going to - I'm too mad.
Guilty!
Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous, on stage and off. I love you for some of them, in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughingly called our environment. You have to keep your teeth sharp - all right - but I will not have you sharpen them on me, or on Eve!
What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
She hasn't cut them yet, and you know it! So when you start judging an idealistic, dreamy-eyed kid by the barroom Benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society, I won't have it! Eve Harrington has never, by word, look, thought, or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love. And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me - it spells a paranoiac insecurity that you should be ashamed of!
Cut! Print it! What happens in the next reel? Do I get dragged off screaming to the snake pits?
How about calling it a night?
And you pose as a playwright? A situation pregnant with possibilities and all you can think of is everybody go to sleep.
Have you no human consideration?
Show me a human, and I might have!
We have to go to City Hall for the marriage license and blood test.
I'd marry you if it turned out you had no blood at all.
Don't get up. And please stop acting as if I were the queen mother.
I'm sorry, I...
Outside of a beehive, Margo, your behavior would not be considered either queenly or motherly.
You are in a beehive, pal. Didn't you know? We are all busy little bees, full of stings, making honey day and night. Aren't we honey?
Thank you, Eve. I'd like a martini, very dry.
I'll get it.
What'll you have?
A milkshake?
A martini, very dry, please.
Why so remote Addison? I should think you'd be at your protégé's side lending her moral support.
Miss Casswell at the moment is where I can lend no support, moral or otherwise.
In the lady's, shall we say, lounge?
...being violently ill to her tummy.
Heaven help me. I love a psychotic!
You have every reason for happiness.
Except happiness!
I love you, Max. I really mean it. I love you. Come to the pantry.
She loves me like a father. Also, she's loaded.
As it happens, there are particular aspects of my life to which I would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges.
For instance what?
For instance: you!
You're not much of a bargain, you know. You're conceited and thoughtless and messy.
""Don't let it worry you"", said the camera man, ""Even De Mille couldn't see anything looking through the wrong end!"" So that was the first and last...
Don't let me kill the point. Or isn't it a story for grownups?
You've heard it - about the time I looked into the wrong end of the camera finder.
Remind me to tell you about the time I looked into the heart of an artichoke.
I'd like to hear it.
Some snowy night, in front of the fire.
Margo Channing is ageless - spoken like a press agent.
I know what I'm talking about. After all, they're my plays.
Spoken like an author. Lloyd, I'm not twenty-ish, I'm not thirty-ish. Three months ago I was forty years old. Forty. Four O. That slipped out. I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I suddenly feel as if I've taken all my clothes off.
I'll admit I may have seen better days, but I'm still not to be had for the price of a cocktail like a salted peanut.
Where is Princess... fire and music?
What makes you think either Miller or Sherwood would stand for the nonsense I take from you? You'd better stick to Beaumont and Fletcher! They've been dead for three hundred years!
ALL playwrights should be dead for three hundred years!
There comes a time that a piano realizes that it has not written a concerto.
And you, I take it, are the Paderewski who plays his concerto on me, the piano?
I start shooting a week from Monday. Zanuck is impatient. He wants me, he needs me.
Zanuck, Zanuck, Zanuck. What are you two, lovers?
I understand that your understudy, Miss Harrington, has given her notice.
Too bad.
I'm broken up about it.
You be the host. It's your party. Happy birthday, welcome home, and we who are about to die salute you.
Many of your guests have been wondering when they may be permitted to view the body. Where has it been laid out?
It hasn't been laid out, we haven't finished with the embalming. As a matter of fact, you're looking at it - the remains of Margo Channing, sitting up. It is my last wish to be buried sitting up.
Peace and quiet is for libraries!
She thinks only of me, doesn't she?
Well, let's say she thinks only about you, anyway.
How do you mean that?
I'll tell you how: like... like she's studying you, like you was a play or a book or a set of blueprints - how you walk, talk, eat, think, sleep...
I'm sure that's very flattering, Birdie. I'm sure there's nothing wrong with it.
Looks like I'm going to have a very fancy party...
I thought you were going to be late.
When I'm guest of honor?
I had no idea you were even here.
I ran into Eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing.
That never stopped you before.
Well, we started talking, she wanted to know all about Hollywood, she seemed so interested...
She's a girl of so many interests.
It's a pretty rare quality these days.
She's a girl of so many rare qualities.
So she seems.
So you've pointed out, so often. So many qualities, so often. Her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth, affection - and so young. So young and so fair...
I haven't got a union. I'm slave labor.
Well?
But the wardrobe women have got one, and next to a tenor, a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business.
I'm sorry, Margo.
What for? It isn't as though you personally drained the gas tank yourself.
Please don't play governess, Karen. I haven't your unyielding good taste. I wish *I* could have gone to Radcliffe, too, but Father wouldn't hear of it... He needed help behind the notions counter
I'm being rude now, aren't I? Or should I say ""ain't I""?
You're maudlin and full of self-pity. You're magnificent.
I distinctly remember, Addison, crossing you off of my guest list. What are you doing here?
Dear Margo, you were an unforgettable Peter Pan. You must play it again, soon. You remember Miss Casswell.
I do not. How do you do?
We've never met. Maybe that's why?
Miss Casswell is an actress, a graduate of the Copacabana school of the dramatic arts.
Ah, Eve.
Good evening, Mr. DeWitt.
I'd no idea you two knew each other.
This must be at long last our formal introduction. Until now, we've only met in passing.
That's how you met me... in passing.
Eve, this is an old friend of Mr. DeWitt's mother. Miss Casswell, Miss Harrington.
Miss Casswell.
How do you do?
Addison, I've been waiting for you to meet Eve for the longest time.
It could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it.
You've heard of her great interest in the theater.
We have that in common.
Then you two must have a long talk.
I'm afraid Mr. DeWitt would find me boring.
You won't bore him long, you won't get a chance to talk.
Claudia, come here.
You see that man, that's Max Fabian, the producer. Now, go do yourself some good.
Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
Because that's what they are.
Now, go and make him happy.
Now, don't worry about your little charge, she'll be in safe hands.
Ah-men.
I'm a junkyard.
You've been talking to that venomous fishwife Addison DeWitt!
In this case, apparently as trustworthy as the World Almanac!
You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy, playing that childish little game of cat and mouse.
Not mouse, never mouse. If anything *rat*!
Bill's welcome home birthday party might go down in history. Even before the party started, I could smell disaster in the air. I knew it, I sensed it, even as I finished dressing for the blasted party.
The extra help get here?
There's some loose characters dressed as maids and butlers. Who'd you call, the William Morris Agency?
You're not being funny: I could *get* actors for less.
I can't believe you're making this up. It sounds like something out of an old Clyde Fitch play!
Clyde Fitch, though you may not think so, was well before my time.
I've always denied the legend that you were in ""Our American Cousin"" the night Lincoln was shot.
I *don't* think that's funny!
Heartburn? It's that Miss Casswell. I don't see why she hasn't given Addison heartburn.
No heart to burn!
Everybody has a heart - except some people."
Norma Desmond,BB,Prima Donna,"Wait a minute, haven't I seen you before? I know your face.
Get out! Or, shall I call my servant?
You're Norma Desmond. You used to be in silent pictures. You used to be big.
I *am* big. It's the *pictures* that got small.
We didn't need dialogue. We had faces!
And I promise you I'll never desert you again because after 'Salome' we'll make another picture and another picture. You see, this is my life! It always will be! Nothing else! Just us, and the cameras, and those wonderful people out there in the dark!... All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up.
I didn't know you were planning a comeback.
I hate that word. It's a return, a return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
I'm not an executive, just a writer.
You are, are you? writing words, words, more words! Well, you'll make a rope of words and strangle this business! With a microphone there to catch the last gurgles, and Technicolor to photograph the red, swollen tongues!
We don't need two cars, we have a car. Not one of those cheap new things made of chromium and spit, an Isotta-Fraschini. Have you ever heard of Isotta-Fraschini? All handmade. Cost me $28,000.
Without me, there wouldn't be any Paramount studio.
You heard him. I'm a star.
Norma, you're a woman of 50, now grow up. There's nothing tragic about being 50, not unless you try to be 25.
The greatest star of them all.
They took the idols and smashed them, the Fairbankses, the Gilberts, the Valentinos! And who've we got now? Some nobodies!
Oh, wake up, Norma, you'd be killing yourself to an empty house. The audience left twenty years ago. Now, face it.
That's a lie! They still want me!
There once was a time in this business when I had the eyes of the whole world! But that wasn't good enough for them, oh no! They had to have the ears of the whole world too. So they opened their big mouths and out came talk. Talk! TALK!
You really going to send that script to DeMille?
Yes, I am! This is the day! Here's the chart from my astrologer. She read DeMille's horoscope, she read mine.
Did she read the script?
DeMille is Leo. I'm Scorpio. Mars' been transiting Jupiter for weeks. Today is the day of *greatest* conjunction.
No one ever leaves a star. That's what makes one a star.
The stars are ageless, aren't they?
Don't be silly.
Here, I was going to give it to you at midnight.
Norma, I can't take it, you've bought me enough.
Shut up, I'm rich! I'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash! I've got a million dollars.
Keep it.
Own three blocks downtown, I've got oil in Bakersfield, pumping, *pumping*, pumping! What's it for but to buy us anything we want!
Cut out that ""us"" business!
What's the matter with you?
What right do you have to take me for granted?
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
Has it ever occurred to you that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?
Who? Some car hop, or dress extra?
What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino, somebody with polo ponies, a big shot!
What you're trying to say is that you don't want me to love you. Say it. Say it!
I'd like the coffin to be white, and I want it specially lined with satin. White... or pink. Maybe red! Bright flaming red! Let's make it gay!
Tell her, Max. C'mon, do her that favor. Tell her there isn't going to be any picture. Tell her there are no fan letters other than the ones you write.
It's not true! Max!
Madame is the greatest star of them all.
You're a writer, you said.
Why?
Are you or aren't you?
That's what it says on my Guild card.
And you have written pictures, haven't you?
I sure have. Want a list of my credits?
I want to ask you something. Come in here.
Last one I wrote was about Okies in the Dust Bowl. You'd never know because when it reached the screen, the whole thing played on a torpedo boat.
No one ever leaves a star...
Jonesy! Hey, Jonesy!
You there! Why are you so late? Why have you kept me waiting so long?
There just aren't any faces like that any more. Maybe one - Garbo.
Those idiot producers. Those imbeciles. Haven't they got any eyes? Have they forgotten what a star looks like? I'll show them! I'll be up there again, so help me!
This way. In here. I put him on my massage table, in front of the fire. He always liked fires and poking at them with a stick. I've made up my mind, we'll bury him in the garden.
How much will it be? I warn you, don't give me a fancy price just because I'm rich!
Young man, tell me something; how long is a movie script these days? I mean how many pages?
Depends on what it is: a Donald Duck or a Joan of Arc.
It's the story of Salome. I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
DeMille?
We made a lot of pictures together.
And you'll play Salome?
Who else?
Salome... what a woman. What a part! The princess in love with a holy man. She dances the dance of the seven veils. He rejects her. So, she lands his head on a golden tray - kissing his cold, dead lips.
They'll love it in Pamona.
They'll love it every place!
What it needs is - eh - maybe a little more dialogue.
What for? I can say anything I want with my eyes.
Sagittarius! I like Sagittarians - you can trust them.
Cut away from me?
Well, honestly, its a little too much of you. They don't want you in every scene.
They don't? Then why do they still write me fan letters every day? Why do they beg me for my photographs? Why? Because they want to see me! Me! Norma Desmond!
One diamond.
One heart.
Spade.
Pass.
You know, to me, getting dressed up was always just putting on my dark blue suit.
I don't like the studs they sent. I want you to have a pearl - a big luscious pearl.
Well, I'm not going to wear earrings. I can tell you that.
You know, this floor used to be wood. But, I had it changed. Valentino said there's nothing like tile for a tango.
There are no other guests. We don't want to share this night with other people. This is for you and me.
Great stars have great pride!
I'll do it again. I'll do it again! I'll do it again...
I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me!
I can still see myself in the line. Marie Prevost. Mabel Normand. Mabel was always stepping on my feet.
Madame is wanted on the telephone.
You know better than to interrupt me.
Paramount is calling.
Who?
Paramount studios.
The last time I saw you was someplace very gay! I remember waving to you. I was dancing on a table!
A lot of people were. Lindbergh had just landed in Paris.
Norma, I haven't done anything.
Of course, you haven't. I wouldn't let you.
Cameras? What is it Max?
The cameras have arrived.
They have? Tell Mr. DeMille I'll be on the set at once.
I can't go on with the scene. I'm too happy. Mr. DeMille, do you mind if I say a few words? Thank you. I just want to tell you all how happy I am to be back in the studio, making a picture again! You don't know how much I've missed all of you."
Lon Hammond Jr.,BG,Romantic Runnerup,"The way I see it, I got three choices. One, I can shoot him. Two, I can kick the crap out of him. Or three, I leave you. Well, all that's no good. You see, 'cause none of those options get me you.
When I'm with Noah I feel like one person and when I'm with you I feel like someone totally different.
Allie, it's normal not to forget your first love but I want you for myself. I don't want to convince my fiancée that she should be with me.
You don't have to. I already know I should be with you.
Should I be worried?"
Prince Edward,BG,Romantic Runnerup,"Thank you for taking care of my bride, peasants.
Giselle!
I've been dreaming of a...
Have you any last words before I dispatch you?
You have got to be kidding me!
Strange words!
Magic Mirror. I beg you. Tell me where she is!
Reporting from 116th and Broadway.
One hundred and sixteenth and Broadway!
Thank you mirror!
Go ahead, Pip. What is it you want to say?
You with me.
Nathaniel?
Uh-huh. Nathaniel.
Nathaniel's glad to have me near.
No-no-no-no-no!
Broop, broop, broop.
Giselle.
Oh, I know this one.
Apple?
No, thank you.
It's good.
Oh, okay.
You feel you'd die without me here.
You've met your match, you foul bellowing beast!
Everybody stay on the bus.
Giselle? My love?
Giselle?
Right. The steel beast is dead, peasants! I've set you all free!
Are you crazy? Nobody stabs my bus! I'll tear you apart! Do you hear me? You get down here RIGHT NOW!
Madam, allow me...
Nathaniel, old friend!
Sire, may I suggest that you, uh...
You? A friend a' his? Crazy tight-wearin'... Are you tryin' to mess up my route?
I'll tear you both apart! Don't you roll your eyes at me, you...
A RAT! GET IT AWAY FROM ME!
Well, strictly speaking, he's a chipmunk.
Sire, may I suggest we seek elsewhere for your bride?
Why would I ever align myself with that buffoon? I mean, think about it. Why...?
Silence! You lying, murderous wretch! When we return home, Andalasia shall know of your treachery. Your days as queen will be over!
Take my crown? Don't you think that's a bit melodramatic, dear?
I don't know what ""melodramatic"" means, but you'll be removed from the throne, Narissa. I will see to it.
I was just thinking.
Think-ing?
Before we leave, there's one thing I would love to do.
Well, name it my love, and it is done.
I want to go on a date.
A date!
What's a date?
I seek a beautiful girl. My life partner, my one coquette, the answer to my love's duet.
I-I'd like to find one of them too, you know?
It seems as if this box controls the Magic Mirror.
... You're too late.
My apologies.
Oh, it's you.
Yes, it's me. And you are?
Giselle.
Oh, Giselle! We shall be married in the morning!
Sire, do you like yourself?
What's not to like?
Yes, there's a maid somewhere I've never met/ Who was made...

... who was made...
... to finish...
What's wrong?
You're not singing.
Oh. Oh, no I'm not. Well, I was just thinking.
Think-ing...?
Fear not, Giselle! I will rescue you!
Yeah, but who's gonna rescue MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE?
Nathaniel likes the way I leap?
I'm handsome even when I sleep?"
James Norrington,BG,Romantic Runnerup,"Our fates have been entwined, Elizabeth, but never joined.
What are you doing?
Choosing a side.
I had nothing to do with your father's death. But that does not absolve me of my other sins."
Julian Mercer,BG,Romantic Runnerup,"When something happens to you that hasn't happened before, don't you at least have to find out what it is?
Look who's answering the door!
Look who's at the door!
These are for you to give me when you apologize.
I've never seen a woman that age naked before.
You're kidding.
Hey! We're not all doctors, baby.
I knew you'd smell good.
It's just... soap
Oh. *Her*. She is a *major* piece of work. Doc, the woman wears turtlenecks in the middle of summer: she's *beyond* uptight. Almost makes her fun to be around.
Uptight. That's funny, I haven't noticed that.
Try living with her.
You know what Freud said they are no accidents.
Trust me this was an accident.
You really are a very sexy woman.
No, really, swear to God, I'm NOT.
Must we go through this every time? Come here.
The woman is really very brilliant, but she cannot hold her liquor.
I like that about me.
Me too.
Me too.
If I were writing this, this is where I would write ""an awkward moment"".
Honey, if you were writing this, I'd be DEAD!
How great is it for you that im not intimidated by your brilliance?"
Michael Grates,BG,Romantic Runnerup,"Have I stepped over some line in the sands of coolness with you? Because excuse me if somebody doesn't know the secret handshake with you.
There's no secret handshake. There's an IQ prerequisite, but there's no secret handshake.
Are you religious?
Um, uh, I guess, uh, I guess I'm, uh, a non-practicing Jew.
Hey, I'm a non-practicing virgin.
Can you hear me now?"
Proteus,BG,Romantic Runnerup,"It's my responsibility to bring the Book of Peace safely to Syracuse.
See, now I just feel bad, 'cause you're gonna get fired.
You still fight like an old woman.
Sinbad? What are you doing here?
Working. You?
Do you have a plan?
Uh... how about try not to get killed?
Do you have any idea how serious this is?
Do you have any idea how many times I've heard that today?"
Alonzo,X,Dirty Cop,"How much money was in that bag?
40 G's.
What was that for?
You really wanna know?
Yeah. I asked, didn't I?
Nothing's free in this world, Jake. Not even arrest warrants.
Shit, I didn't wanna know.
Alonzo, heard you had an expensive weekend in Vegas. How did you ever screw up so bad?
Hey, I didn't know. It's not my town. I'm not omniscient.
The Russians don't care if you have a badge. They'll whack you. You ought to hop a jet out of here.
Why? It's an easy fix. I'll just cash in on an account.
Which one?
One of my old ones, my first one. The guy's a high security risk anyway. If I'm not around, who's gonna help keep him off the radar?
All right, it's your call. I do not want you to dick this up. I don't want to see you on the front page like the rest of those assholes.
Alonzo, there's two shots left in that other stinger. We need to just kill your boy right now and say Roger got him coming through the door.
We ain't killing nobody. This guy's got the magic eye. I can feel it. Just had a little freak-out, that's all. Now I say he's cool, and nobody's gonna hurt him. But you do have a decision to make, because in about 10 seconds, this whole place is gonna be overrun with blue suits.
So just walk outside and clear your head, or just shoot me.
Hey, Paul.
You're dead, motherfucker! You hear me?
You're fuckin' dead!
Why do you wanna be a narc?
I want to protect the streets by ridding it of dangerous drugs.
Yeah, but why do you wanna be a narc?
I wanna make detective.
There you go. You stick around with me, you'll make it. Unlearn that bullshit they teach you at the Academy. That shit'll get you killed out here.
I'll do anything you want me to do.
My nigga. Roll that window down first.
You gotta see the streets. You gotta feel it. You gotta smell it, you gotta taste the streets. How's your Espanol?
Uh, más o menos.
Learn that shit, brother. That shit'll get you killed. These motherfuckers out there be plotting all types of shit on you.
It's not what you know, it's what you can prove. Mark and Paul, you kicked the door down. Jeff's the first one through. Roger hits Jeff twice.
What's the matter, one go through?
Yeah, you shot him.
You fucking shot me, man!
Don't worry about it. You'll get a medal.
Get me an ambulance!
Hey, hey, hey. You wanna go to jail or you wanna go home? Let me quarterback this thing. Mark, Paul, you kicked the door down. Jeff's the first one through. Roger shoots Jeff twice, bang bang. Our new guy, Hoyt, he's in second. Drops Roger with some fine shotgun work. Now who shot Roger?
New guy, came in spraying.
Who shot Roger?
Boot did it.
What did you guys see?
Hoyt blasted him.
Hey, fuck Hoyt, all right? Ambulance time!
Done. Paul, call 'em up.
11-49-98 Shots fired. Officer down. Repeat. Officer down. 5951 Baxter Street.
Today's a training day, Officer Hoyt. Show you around, give you a taste of the business. I got 38 cases pending trial, 63 in active investigations, another 250 on the log I can't clear. I supervise five officers. That's five different personalities. Five sets of problems. You can be number six if you act now. But I ain't holding no hands, okay? I ain't baby-sitting. You got today and today only to show me who and what you're made of. You don't like narcotics, get the fuck out of my car. Go get you a nice, pussy desk job, chasing bad checks or something, you hear me?
What's here?
Transactions. You see that Salvatrucha zero head sitting on that fence acting like he's not slanging dope? That's my boy. My boy, Neto. The punk's only 17, but he can kill with the best. He's one of mine. He works for me.
Jesus, he's an informer?
Teammate. I got eyes everywhere. He gets to peddle a little reefer, gets money to take care of the family. He lets me know when big things are going on. Big transactions.
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Look at that. Sexy ain't it?
And you trust him?
Damn right I trust him. I sprung his mom from INS detention. Watch this.
You see that hand-to-hand?
Yeah, I saw it.
When was the last time you did a felony stop?
Two weeks ago.
Good. You need practice.
They look like a bunch of college kids.
They'll get their education today. I want the Brady Bunch grabbing glass. I take the front, you take the back.
Stay off of the Rover. Let's go.
What's that?
Motherfucking crack, man.
That's right, Jimmy Crack Corn. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Oh, you're federally fucked now. You got crack... and a gun. You know with your record you can get 10 years per bullet? Now you gon' gimme a name.
That's 10 right there.
Come on, man. You know I ain't no snitch, man.
I know you ain't no snitch. Gimme a name.
That's 20.
Fuck!
Gimme a name.
That's 30 years. You wanna go to jail or you wanna go home?
He in the county!
Who?
Nigga named Sandman. That's all the fuck I know,man! Shit!
See how easy that was?
I'm sick of this shit, man.
You wanna collect the evidence?
Fuck that.
My nigga.
Make sure that bathtub is clean, homey.
It behoves you not to dick around on this one. Justifiable homicide in the line of duty? What happened was...
What happened was murder... and armed robbery. Wait, we had badges, so it's different?
Open your eyes, son. Can't you see?
That man was your friend, and you killed him like a fly.
Why is he my friend, because he knows my first name? Roger sold dope to kids. The world is a better place without him. This man was the biggest major violator in Los Angeles. This is the game. I'm playing his ass. That's my job. That's your job. I watched that cocksucker operate with impunity for over 10 years, and now I got him. The shit's chess, it ain't checkers. What, we all of a sudden gonna roll up in a black-and-white? Come on, man, take the money.
I told you, I'm not gonna take that money.
All right, burn it, barbecue it, fish-fry it, I don't give a fuck. But the boys'll feel better about it.
Fuck their feelings.
You're not making them feel like you're part of the team.
The team? You guys are fuckin' insane. All right, I'll go back to the Valley. I'll cut parking tickets. Why does it have to be this way?
I'm sorry I exposed you to it, but it is. It's ugly, but it's necessary... Sometimes you gotta have a little dirt on you for anybody to trust you.
What's happening? You got the picks and shovels?
You gonna dig a ditch?
Nope. You are. That's a nice suit.
What's going on, killer?
I can't call it. Been hearing some shit out here on these streets. You all right?
Yeah. I talked to the three wise men today. Everything's all good.
Shit, you say we can get away with it, I'm with you on that.
Who the fuck is this?
Jake Hoyt. I'm from Valley Patrol. It's my first day.
You a long way from Starbucks homey.
Yo, why the fuck is he in on this?
Gotta get his cherry popped sometime.
Yo, stay the fuck outta my way. Just for the big dogs, you feel me?
All right. Here's the warrant signed and sealed by the judge, thanks to the Sandman. Alright, now listen up; Safety is first. He gives us shit - Boom! We're giving him lead. Let's do this right so we can all go home and do the wife or the girlfriend thing, alright? Let's suit up, ladies. Time to punch in.
, you gonna bust your cherry killing a cop? You know what you get for that, Jake? The gas chamber. You know what the gas chamber smells like? Pine oil. I'ma send you to a pine oil heaven. I'ma get that gun and I'ma get that gun and I'm going to get that money, and your not going to shit because you're not going to shoot a cop in the back."
Dennis Peck,X,Dirty Cop,"
I could kill you.
Go ahead.
Kill her. Come on, Steven. Be a man! Kill her. She paid me to kill you. She did.
Go on, shoot her. She's a tramp. She's a *big* tramp. Your parents are dead, and you've got a tramp for a wife. She fucks everybody.
Steven, that was my foot.
Hi, Raymond!
You know what she really wanted? You know? Yeah, I should have guessed. She liked it in the ass, Raymond. That's right. Right in the fucking ass! Drove her crazy. She came so much, for a second I thought she was going to pass out on me.
You know what they say about Latin fighters, Raymond? You know what they say? Too fucking MACHO! That's right. *Too fucking macho!* They don't backpedal when they have to. So they're used up. Young.
Yeah, why don't you clean yourself up with that. That's right. Clean yourself up.
Get off my bed!
Sorry about the dyke, Raymond. Cute little ass.
You're so fucking easy, Raymond. Like a big baby with buttons all over. I push the buttons.
I'm going to miss my children. Gonna miss them.
Put the knife down!
You think he was aiming for my leg?
That's pretty good. You're pretty good there, Raymond.
I'm taking you in.
Fuck you! You're so correct. You don't feel
because *you* do not have *children!*
You don't know what it's like. Everything changes when you have children. You don't think about yourself anymore. You think about nothing but them. You'd go around the world for them, you *selfish YUPPIE!*
She's very pretty too. A little skinny for my taste, but they say the skinny ones give good head so...
OK, here's what's going to happen. I'm gonna fuck her for a while and teach her how to come.
Get up!
Then that way, she can show you what she likes!
They said you're a pretty good boxer, Raymond. You're pretty fucking good.
Not bad!
Clean yourself up!
Give my best to Kathleen!
How many cops you know, huh? Got nothing. Divorced, alcoholic, kids won't talk to them anymore, can't get it up. Sitting there in their little apartments, alone in the dark, playing lollipop with a service revolver?
Can I trust you?
Of course you can trust me.
I'm a cop."
Colin Sullivan,X,Dirty Cop,"Just fucking kill me. Just fucking kill me.
I am killing you.
Freeze!
Whoa! Put the fucking gun down!
Put your fucking hands up!
Alright, alright. I can get you your money!
What did you say?
I said I can get you your...
You didn't come here to talk, you came here to get arrested.
You have fucking tapes of what? Costello was my informant. I was a rat? Fuck you, prove it.
Get up!
What is this? A citzens arrest? Blow me. Only one of us is a cop here Bill. Did you hear me Bill? No one knows who you fucking are!
Will you shut the fuck up!
I'm a sargeant in the Massachusetts State Police, who the fuck are you? I erased you!
You erased me, huh?
Yea... shoot a cop, Einstein, watch what happens.
What would happen is this bullet would go right through your fucking head!
Watch what happens!
What? So you can get the parade? The bagpipes and bullshit? Fuck you! Fuck you! I'm fucking arresting you!
That's the stupidest thing you could do.
Shut the fuck up!
I could give a fuck if the charges don't stick... I'm still fucking arresting you.
Shit.
Problem?
Yeah, I got a problem. I run rat fucks like you, okay? I don't like 'em.
The day you wouldn't take a promotion, let me know. And if you'd taken care of this, I wouldn't even be here.
Fuck yourself, you piece of shit.
And I'm gonna need the identity of your undercovers.
Blow me, all right? But not literally, though. Unfortunately, there's no promotion involved for you.
Fucking prick.
You're an FBI informant? Are you fucking kidding me?
Grow up!
Of course I talked to the FBI.
Do they know who I am?
I... I never gave up anybody... who wasn't going down anyway. Nobody knows nothin'.
Frank... Frank. Do they know about me?
I know about you, Colin. You know I'd never give you up. You're like a...
What, like a son? To you? Is that what this is about? All that murderin'... and fuckin'... and no sons?
Was that that shrink cunt that answered the phone?
Remember I told you that we were gonna... she was gonna move in?
Yeah.
She moved in.
You better get organized, quick.
Hey, last time I checked, I tipped you off and you're not in jail.
Are you listening to me?
Yeah.
Do you like Little Miss Thing suckin' on your cock?
Yes. Yes, I do.
So earn it. I'm getting the feeling we got a cop in my crew.
Yeah, I know. I'm kinda getting that feeling too.
He's one of yours. Inside. Have you seen anything?
Frank, I got no access to Queenan's undercover files. He and Dignam run the snitches. I'm doing my best...
Your best? What do you think we're in, the fuckin' haberdashery business?
Look, Frank, if you don't relax, if you don't relax, I can't relax. All right? Now what I need you to do is you get me information on the people who were with you last night. Your crew. Get me Social Security numbers, get me...
How is your wedding coming along?
Great, great; she's a doctor.
That's outstanding.
Yeah.
Marriage is an important part of getting ahead: lets people know you're not a homo; married guy seems more stable; people see the ring, they think at least somebody can stand the son of a bitch; ladies see the ring, they know immediately you must have some cash or your cock must work.
Yeah, it's working... Overtime!
I'm glad to hear that.
Yeah... Thank you.
What Freud said about the Irish is: We're the only people who are impervious to psychoanalysis.
FREEZE!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Put your fucking hands up!
Put the fucking gun down! Put the gun... put the gun down, alright? I came here to talk some sense into you!
Hands!
Alright! Just act professional. I can get you your money!
What'd you say?
I can get you your MONEY!
You didn't come here to talk, alright. You came here to get arrested!
Here, this is my card.
Nah, I don't need that. I'm a detective. I'll find you.
No, I'm just kidding, I need the card.
Okay.
Get you? Give you? Who the fuck do you work for? What?
All right, all right. Frank, Frank, Frank, I'm sorry, Frank. If you could, please. What I need are SS numbers, DOBs, just all the pedigree information so I can run it on my end and we can ID the prick. If you can just get me that information, what I can do is I can just - I - I - we're gonna handle it. I - I - I can handle it.
Colin, calm down, or you'll shoot in your pants.
I'll get you the records and what not. But listen to me, son. Don't disappoint me on this or some other guy will be putting their fat cock up little Miss Freud's ass.

If we're not gonna make it, it's gotta be you that gets out, cause I'm not capable. I'm fucking Irish, I'll deal with something being wrong for the rest of my life.
You got a nice suit at home or do you like coming to work everyday dressed like you're goin' to invade Poland?
You're a worker. You rise fast.
Like a 12-year-old's dick.
Thank you, Sergeant.
My pleasure.
I'm waiting for you to make your move.
I don't know, if that thing moves I'm gonna shoot it.
I need those passwords.
No, you *want* those passwords.
I can't wait to see you explain this one to a fucking Suffolk County jury you fucking cocksucker. This is gonna be fucking fun!
Fuck you, fuckin' queers. Firemen gettin' pussy for the first time in the history of fire or pussy. Hey go save a kitten in a tree, you fucking homos.
Yeah, shoot a cop, Einstein. Watch what happens.
What would happen is this bullet would go right through your fucking head!
What?
Yeah, you got a tail. Two cars, not very subtle. They're not gonna be very subtle from now on. That's what I've been trying to tell you.
So get rid of 'em.
There's no need to go yourself, Frank.
GET RID OF THE FUCKING TAIL!
All right.
Cui Bono, who benefits?
Cui gives a shit. It's got a freakin' bow on it.
So do you know why Queenan went into that building?
No.
Well, a better question is why the fuck were your guys following him?
I told Internal Investigations to follow Captain Queenan.
Why?
That's Internal Investigations' business.
Fucking piece of shit!
Cocksucker! I don't have to fucking explain anything to anybody! I can fucking investigate anybody I fucking want to!
Let him go, come on.
I don't give a fuck what you think! Captain, I've got reason to believe that Queenan got killed by his own fucking undercover.
That's a fucking lie.
He has fucking information in a locked file, as did Captain Queenan. I need access to those files.
Hey, I forgot the password, but if you'd like to come down to the garage with me, I'd be happy to give it to you.
That's a fucking lie.
Nobody calls me a liar!
I think you better call your mother, and tell her you won't be home for supper.
Look it, fuck-stick, you don't have to trust me. Just listen to what I am saying to you.
Now Mrs. Kennefick, I knew your son. I knew Miles. Now he was a little younger than me but he was behind me in school. I wanna get these people who did this to him. Would you like to help us? You wanna help us catch the people who forced your son to do a robbery and then killed him?
Allegedly.
...""Allegedly"".
If he was killed, he probably did something wrong.
But not the robbery. That's not wrong. He do something else wrong?
Wave to your girlfriend, honey.
I mean, fuck yourself!
Did you get that?
""Allegedly"" or ""fuck yourself""?
Welcome to the neighborhood.
Frank? What the fuck is wrong with you?
See anything you like, Colin?
I almost fucking shot you!
You're not indulging in self-abuse, are you? I hope you're not turning into one of them sob sisters who wants to get caught. You're not cracking up, are you?
I don't crack up.
Picking a place like this, where any cop can see you. Jesus.
If it was such a fucking bad idea, why'd you show up?
I own the place.
Why am I not fucking surprised? Look, I gotta tell you...
You're getting re-assigned. I know.
How the fuck do you know that?
Where'd they put you?
Hey Frank, I gotta find myself.
You're telling me, sonny boy.
I gotta find the guy you got in the department.
With everybody looking up their own ass, and you looking for yourself, I'd put my money on nobody finds nothing.
I know, but Frank - look, for me, you gotta lay low. Right now.
Colin, laying low is not what I do.
Okay, fucking big daddy Frank. Fucking perfect. But what good am I to you if you don't listen to me?
I can get the rat. You just gotta let me do it my way, Frank.
Okay.
But Colin - I hope I don't have to remind you that if you don't find that cheese-eating rat bastard in your department, most likely it won't be me who suffers for it.
Now why would you have to remind me of that? Would I be any good at what I do if I didn't fucking already know that? Frank, you gotta trust me. Alright, just trust me Frank. Hey, it fucking involves lying and I'm pretty fucking good at that. Right?
Maybe because it's always been so easy for me to get cunt, that I never understood jacking off in a theater.
Hey, now why do you work for the state?
Why not? You do.
No, what you do, the degrees and everything you got, you're hot shit. So why do you make as much as a guidance counselor?
Because... I believe in public service.
So now you're gonna fuck with me?
Now you're gonna be ridiculous?
Put down the gun and step away from Sergeant Sullivan!
Look, I called you. You specifically. You know who I am. I'm not gonna shoot. I told you to meet me downstairs.
Help me.
PUT THE WEAPON ON THE DECK AND STEP AWAY FROM SERGEANT SULLIVAN!
Shoot the fuckin' prick already!
Where's Dignam? I told you to bring Dignam!
Shoot the motherfucker!
Put the weapon on the ground and we'll discuss it.
SHOOT THE MOTHERFUCKER!
Look, I got boxes of tapes, evidence, all of that! I got proof! He's Costello's rat!
Maybe you do. But right now I need you to put the weapon on the deck and step away from Sergeant Sullivan!
What? Look, forget about it. Your old man was a janitor and his son's only a cop.
Fucking firefighters are bunch of homos.
They are!
What the fuck is it with and your phone? Uh?
You know.
There is no need to remind you that if you don't find that cheese eating rat bastard in your department... it won't be me who suffers for it.
What I be any good at my job if I didn't fucking already know that?
Just get him and smoke him the fuck out.
I'll get the rat... you just gotta let me do it my way, Frank."
Police Captain Hank Quinlan,X,Dirty Cop,"Come on, read my future for me.
You haven't got any.
Hmm? What do you mean?
Your future's all used up.
We're closed.
You've been cookin' at this hour?
Just cleanin' up.
Have you forgotten your old friend, hmm?
I told you we were closed.
I'm Hank Quinlan.
I didn't recognize you. You should lay off those candy bars.
It's either the candy or the hooch. I must say, I wish it was your chili I was gettin' fat on. Anyway, you're sure lookin' good.
You're a mess, honey.
Yeah. That pianola sure brings back memories.
The customers go for it - it's so old, it's new. We got the television too. We run movies. What can I offer you?
That wasn't no miss, Vargas. That was just to turn you 'round, so I don't have to shoot you in the back. Unless you'd rather run for it.
That's the second bullet I stopped for you.
Captain, you won't have any trouble with me.
You bet your sweet life I won't.
I don't speak Mexican. Let's keep it in English, Vargas.
That's all right with me. I'm sure he's just as unpleasant in any language.
Unpleasant? Strange. I've been told I have a very winning personality. The very best shoe clerk the store ever had.
That was the last killer that ever got out of my hands.
How could you arrest me here? This is my country.
This is where you're gonna die.
We're wasting our time here.
I wouldn't say that...
An old lady on Main Street last night picked up a shoe. The shoe had a foot in it. We're gonna make you pay for that mess.
What are you trying to do?
We're trying to strap you to the electric chair, boy.
What make you so very sure it was dynamite?
My leg.
Your what?
His game leg. Sometimes he gets a kind of twinge, like folks do for a change of weather. ""Intuition,"" he calls it.
My game leg is startin' to talk to me."
Rooster,X,Dirty Cop,"A righteous man before me stands. A hero in these filthy lands. A brother in arms in heart are you. I was really hoping you get it too.
So long, Tom.
Where are you going?
I dunno. To hell, I suppose.
You know what I think about before I pull the trigger? I think about the infield fly rule. I love that fucking rule. It assumes the worst of everybody. It says sorry batter you're a smuck for poppin' up with runners on and you stupid ass infielder you don't get to cheat and drop the ball just because you caught a break. My favorite part, the batter's out but the runners advance at their own risk. That's the way life should be, you can be a motherfucker at your own risk... or not.
You tried to set me up and this is how you do it? You thought I'd get my dick cut off but instead you blew it.
He's gonna kill again. You know it, and I know it.
I'm tellin' you, you screw it up badly enough they may try to fuck you outta your pension. You wanna risk that?
Yeah.
Fuck yeah.
He is one of the toughest human beings I've ever encountered. He took six bullets in him.
Six? Woo!
Even the night he was wounded, three from previous shootings. The man is a TANK.
So are you fit to return to duty?
Abso-fucking-lutely.
One, between the eye!
Two, between the eye!"
Abel Turner,X,Dirty Cop,"Y'know what Abel? Fuck you.
Is that a 'We Are the World' fuck you?
No. It's a special one. Just for you.
It's alright, I'm an officer.
I don't care if you the Pope, asshole, get your hands up!
I am the police! You *have* to do what I say!
Did you see anybody?
No. I just see you.
Listen to your wife, asshole!"
The Lieutenant,X,Dirty Cop,"Show me how you suck a guy's cock.
I have forgiven them.
But do you have the right? You're not the only woman in the world. You're not even the only nun. Your forgiveness will leave blood in its wake. What if these guys do something like this again? To other women, other virgins? Old women who die from the shock? Do you have the right to forgive them? Can you bear the burden, sister?
Leave it to the Catholic Church. Girls get raped every day, and now we're putting up 50 Gs just 'cause these girls wear fuckin' penguin suits.
I'm sorry, Lord. I've done so many bad things.
If you think you're not getting on that bus, man, you're dead wrong. Now get on that fucking bus, 'cause your life ain't worth shit in this town!
Shit's gonna kill you, man!
What the fuck are you? A drug counsellor... or a drug dealer? If you don't deal your own product, what kind of businessman are you?
Mutt! You got something that you want to say to me? You fuck! You ratfuck, you ratfuck! Here's your... What? Say something, I know you're just standing there. What am I gonna do? You gotta say something! Something! You fuck, you fucking stand there and you want me to do every fucking thing! Where were you? Where the fuck are you? Where were you? Where the hell were you? I... I... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry! I'm sorry! I did so many bad things. I'm sorry. I tried to do... I try to do the ricgt thing, but I'm weak, I'm too fucking weak. I need you to help me! Help me! I need you to help me! Forgive me! Forgive me! Forgive me, please! Forgive me, father!
You fuck. Where were you?
Can I help you?
Yeah, I'm in charge of the investigation. I'm just checking security.
Security?
Yeah. You wouldn't want those guys coming back, huh? For the nun? Or for you?
You raped a holy thing. You destroyed that young girl. And she forgives you. Ya hear that? She forgives you. You fucking heroes. Ya like holding her down and shoving your dick into her? While she couldn't do nothing about it. Did you like that? Watch this motherfucker! Watch this you cocksucker! Look at that! You can't do a thing about that can you? Can you? Look at me! Can you? Can you fuckface? Can you? There, move. Move you cockscker. Move. I'd like to blow your fucking face apart.
Hey, listen to me. I'm the boss, not Aunt Wendy. When it's your time to use the bathroom, you tell Aunt Wendy to get the fuck out of the bathroom! What are you, men or mice? She's hoggin' the bathroom - call me! Call me, and I'll throw her the fuck out!
I told you once before that this guy will come by your house and blow up your house up with your wife and kids and everybody in it. You know that, right?
Good, good. I'll give him an extra ten grand for his trouble. I hate that fucking house.
Get with the program!"
Austin,AR,Jerk Jock,"What about her?
So baby's got a little back. Hunch, that is. Naah, way too easy.
OK.
I have no pigment...
Any girl with a guitar is hot.
I need sunscreen...
Granted, she's a hippy albino. She could still be prom queen.
OK, uh, what about the Fratelli sisters?
So they're slightly disfigured and connected at the head. But combined, those two make up one pretty decent chick.
Yeah, I'd do 'em.
I know you would, Reggie Ray. But no, I'm looking for somebody who's really messed up. I'm talking about a real shitbomb.
Well, bombs away!
No, no, no, no, anyone but her! Not... Janie Briggs! Guys, she's got glasses and a ponytail! Aw, look at that, she's got paint on her overalls, what is that? Guys, there's no way she could be prom queen!
Damn! That shit's whack!
All I said was, ""I'm pretending to whisper a big secret in your ear, so Jake here thinks that I'm telling you a big secret, which will cause him to break into a hysterical confession where he actually reveals... a big secret. Thus confirming everything I just whispered in your ear.""

Where's Janey?
Little Ms. Run Home To Her Daddy, ran home to her daddy.
How could Priscilla dump me, Jake Wyler? I mean who the hell does she think she is?
I got two words for ya, Jake: Prom Queen... material.
Austin, she's an illusion. Ok, you take away the make-up, the clothes, the way she wears her hair, the smell of her perfume, that cute little face she makes when she's tonguing my balls. Look she's totally replaceable.
Jake Wyler. So congratulations man, you just blew my perfect season. Senor You-Just-Blew-My-Perfect-Season!
What do you want Austin?
A life.
And payback.
C'mon man, don't do this.
No, man, I think I'll hang around. Maybe tell Janey a little S-E-C-R-A-T-P...
Looks like you've got a thing for butt-ugly girls, Mr. I've Got A Thing For Butt-Ugly Girls!
Let's make like a tree and... branch!
Man, go away!
No, I think I'll stick around, maybe tell Janie a little s-e-c-r-a... p.

Gaston,"AE, AR","Egomaniac Hunter, Jerk Jock","It's not right for a woman to read. Soon she starts getting ideas and thinking.
How can you read this? There's no pictures!
Well, some people use their imagination.
Lefou, I'm afraid I've been thinking.
A dangerous pastime.
I know!
This is the day your dreams come true.
What do you know about my dreams, Gaston?
Plenty! Here, picture this: A rustic hunting lodge, my latest kill roasting on the fire, and my little wife massaging my feet, while the little ones play on the floor with the dogs. We'll have six or seven.
Dogs?
No, Belle! Strapping boys, like me!
Imagine that.
And do you know who that little wife will be?
Let me think.
You, Belle!
Gaston, I'm-I'm speechless. I really don't know what to say.
Say you'll marry me!
I'm very sorry, Gaston but but I just don't deserve you!
If I didn't know better, I'd think you had feelings for this monster.
He's no monster Gaston. You are!
Gaston, you are positively primeval!
Why, thank you, Belle! What would you say if you and I took a walk over to the tavern and took a look at my trophies?
Maybe some other time.
I use antlers in all of my decorating!

I'd like to thank you all for coming to my wedding. But first I'd better go in there and uh, propose to the girl!
Come on out and fight!
Were you in love with her, Beast? Did you honestly think she'd want you? When she had someone like me?
I don't usually leave the asylum in the middle of the night, but he said you'd make it worth my while.
Ah, I'm listening.
It's like this: I've got my heart set on marrying Belle, but she needs a little persuasion.
Turned him down flat.
Everyone knows her father's a lunatic. He was in here tonight, raving about a beast in a castle.
Maurice is harmless.
The point is, Belle would do anything to keep him from being locked up.
Yeah, even marry him.
So you want me to throw her father into the asylum unless she agrees to marry you?
Oh, that is despicable.
I love it!
Here in town there's only she, who is beautiful as me! So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle!
It's over, Beast! Belle is mine!
Let me go! Let me go, please! Don't hurt me! I'll do anything! Anything!
Get out!
Take whatever booty you can find, but remember. The Beast is mine!
So, how did it go?
I'll have Belle for my wife! Make no mistake about that!
Touchy!
Lefou, now when Belle and I come out that door...
Oh, I know! I know! I strike up the band!
Not yet!

Kurt Kelly,AR,Jerk Jock,"Let's kick his ass!
Shit, Ram - we're seniors, man. We're too old for that kind of crap. Let's give 'im a good scare, though.
You gonna eat this?
What did your boyfriend say when you told 'im you were movin' to Sherwood, Ohio?
Answer him, dick!
Hey Ram, doesn't this cafeteria have a ""No Fags Allowed"" rule?
Well they, uh, seem to have an open door policy for assholes though, don't they?
What did you say, dickhead?
I'll repeat myself.
When I get that feeling, I need sexual healing.
Yeah, right, asshole!
It'd be so righteous to be in a Veronica Sawyer/Heather Chandler sandwich. Punch it in, Ram.
Oh, hell yes. I wanna set a Heather on my Johnson and just start spinnin' her around like a goddamn pinwheel.
Let's kick his ass.
Shit man, we're seniors now man. We're too old for that kind of shit.
Let's give him a good scare though."
Bo,AR,Jerk Jock,"No, you don't understand. I'm a werewolf, I have an unnatural sexual allure.
Yeah, I know.
What the fuck was that?
My dog.
What kinda dog do you have?
No, I'm not gay, I'm cursed!
I know it must feel like that sometimes...
No, I'm cursed by the Mark of the Beast!
Hey, I know you. You're from PE.
His name is Billy.
Ah, its, uh, Jimmy.
You're the dodgeball crotch target! You should really wear a cup.
Stop it, Bo. Okay?
I'm just lookin' out for him. He can't help it. Every school's got one; the derogatory hit-geek on his way to Fagtown.
Look, uh, I-I'm not gay.
Oh, bummer. You mean you're just an ass-wimp-wad for no reason?
... Y-yeah.
Ha, that sucks.
BOO!"
Garth,AR,Jerk Jock,"I told you, I don't hunt.

I just want to say one thing, if any of you wolves have hurt my daughter I will personally rip out your eyes and shove them down your throat so you can see my claws tearing your carcass open!
Uhh... mom?
Not now dear, mommy's in a rage.
Well, well since Kate 'stood up' Garth, I could show him around until she gets back.
I wouldn't say stood up.
Garth!
Sounds good to me.
Well come on Garth.
Aw, isn't that sweet? She gets it from me.
Who's the coyote?
""Who's the coyote?""... Oh, i get it. That's good... Cuz i'm like...
No one important. Lilly, why don't you take little coyote Humphrey and run along?
I... can't.
You can't!
I mean... you can't?
What's this, Winston? Why can't she marry Garth?
Quiet!
Kate, why can't you marry Garth?
Because I, sort of, uh... fell in love with an Omega.
So, why's this called ""Rabbit-Poo Mountain""?
Because this is where rabbits like to poo.
Ewwww! Gross!
I was just kidding.
Whoa, i get it. You're a funny omega.
Mhm.
Okay. Make me laugh!
Lilly, i just wanted to thank you. Ya know, for showing me around this place.
You mean, you liked it?
Of course i liked hanging out with you. Hell, in fact, i don't remember having such a great time before. Especially with a girl.
Well, i'm glad you had fun, Garth."
Gny. Sgt. Hartman,AA,Drill Sargeant Nasty,"I am Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, your senior drill instructor. From now on you will speak only when spoken to, and the first and last words out of your filthy sewers will be ""Sir"". Do you maggots understand that?
Sir, yes Sir.
Bullshit I can't hear you. Sound off like you got a pair!
SIR, YES SIR!
If you ladies leave my island, if you survive recruit training, you will be a weapon. You will be a minister of death praying for war. But until that day you are pukes. You are the lowest form of life on Earth. You are not even human fucking beings. You are nothing but unorganized grabastic pieces of amphibian shit! Because I am hard, you will not like me. But the more you hate me, the more you will learn. I am hard but I am fair. There is no racial bigotry here. I do not look down on niggers, kikes, wops or greasers. Here you are all equally worthless. And my orders are to weed out all non-hackers who do not pack the gear to serve in my beloved Corps. Do you maggots understand that?
I bet you're the kind of guy that would fuck a person in the ass and not even have the goddamn common courtesy to give him a reach-around. I'll be watching you.
How tall are you, private?
Sir, five-foot-nine, sir.
Five-foot-nine, I didn't know they stacked shit that high!
Did your parents have any children that lived?
Sir, yes, sir.
I bet they regret that. You're so ugly you could be a modern art masterpiece! What's your name fat body?
Sir, Leonard Lawrence, sir.
Lawrence? Lawrence what... of Arabia?
Sir, no, sir.
That name sounds like royalty. Are you royalty?
Sir, no, sir.
Do you suck dicks?
Sir, no, sir.
Bullshit. I bet you could suck a golf ball through a garden hose.
Sir, no, sir.
I don't like the name Lawrence, only faggots and sailors are called Lawrence. From now on you're Gomer Pyle.
Sir, yes, sir.
Tonight, you pukes will sleep with your rifles. You will give your rifle a girl's name because this is the only pussy you people are going to get. Your days of finger-banging ol' Mary-Jane Rottencrotch through her pretty pink panties are over! You're married to this piece. This weapon of iron and wood. And you will be faithful. Port, hut!
Prepare to mount!
Mount!
Port, hut!
Pray!
This is my rifle. There are many others like it, but this one is mine. My rifle is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. Without me, my rifle is useless. Without my rifle, I am useless. I must fire my rifle true. I must shoot straighter than my enemy, who is trying to kill me. I must shoot him before he shoots me. I will. Before God I swear this creed: my rifle and myself are defenders of my country, we are the masters of our enemy, we are the saviors of my life. So be it, until there is no enemy, but peace. Amen.
Order, hut!
At ease! Good night, ladies.
Good night, sir!
Hit it, sweetheart.
Holy Jesus! What is that? What the fuck is that? WHAT IS THAT, PRIVATE PYLE?
Sir, a jelly doughnut, sir!
A jelly doughnut?
Sir, yes, sir!
How did it get here?
Sir, I took it from the mess hall, sir!
Is chow allowed in the barracks, Private Pyle?
Sir, no, sir!
Are you allowed to eat jelly doughnuts, Private Pyle?
Sir, no, sir!
And why not, Private Pyle?
Sir, because I'm too heavy, sir!
Because you are a disgusting fat body, Private Pyle!
Sir, yes, sir!
Then why did you try to sneak a jelly doughnut in your footlocker, Private Pyle?
Sir, because I was hungry, sir!
Because you were hungry...
Private Pyle has dishonored himself and dishonored the platoon. I have tried to help him. But I have failed. I have failed because YOU have not helped me. YOU people have not given Private Pyle the proper motivation! So, from now on, whenever Private Pyle fucks up, I will not punish him! I will punish all of YOU! And the way I see it ladies, you owe me for ONE JELLY DOUGHNUT! NOW GET ON YOUR FACES!
Open your mouth!
They're payin' for it; YOU eat it! Ready! Exercise!
Private Joker, do you believe in the Virgin Mary?
Sir, no, sir!
Well, well, Private Joker, I don't believe I heard you correctly!
Sir, the private said ""no, sir,"" sir!
Why you little maggot, you make me want to vomit!
You Goddamn communist heathen, you had best sound off that you love the Virgin Mary, or I'm gonna stomp your guts out! Now you DO love the Virgin Mary, don't ya?
Sir, NEGATIVE, sir!
Private Joker, are you trying to offend me?
Sir, NEGATIVE, sir! Sir, the private belives any answer he gives will be wrong and the Senior Drill Instructor will only beat him harder if he reverses himself, SIR!
Who's your squad leader, scumbag?
Sir, the squad leader is Private Snowball, sir!
Private Snowball!
Sir, Private Snowball reporting as ordered, sir!
Private Snowball, you're fired. Private Joker's promoted to squad leader.
Sir, aye-aye, sir!
Disappear, scumbag!
Sir, aye-aye, sir!
Where the hell are you from anyway, private?
Sir, Texas, sir.
Holy dog shit! Texas? Only steers and queers come from Texas, Private Cowboy, and you don't look much like a steer to me, so that kinda narrows it down. Do you suck dicks?
Sir, no, sir!
Are you a peter puffer?
Sir, no, sir!
I bet you're the kind of guy who would fuck a person in the ass and not even have the goddamn common courtesy to give him a reach-around. I'll be watching you!
What is this Mickey Mouse shit? What in the name of Jesus H. Christ are you animals doing in my head? Why is Private Pyle out of his bunk after lights-out? Why is Private Pyle holding that weapon? Why aren't you stomping Private Pyle's guts out?
Sir, it is the private's duty to inform the senior drill instructor that Private Pyle has a full magazine that is locked and loaded, Sir!
Now, you listen to me, Private Pyle. And you listen good. I want that weapon, and I want it now. You will place that rifle on the deck at your feet, and step back away from it.
What is your major malfunction, numbnuts? Didn't Mommy and Daddy show you enough attention when you were a child?
Were you born a fat, slimy, scumbag puke piece o' shit, Private Pyle, or did you have to work on it?
Today, you people are no longer maggots. Today, you are Marines. You're part of a brotherhood. From now on until the day you die, wherever you are, every Marine is your brother. Most of you will go to Vietnam. Some of you will not come back. But always remember this: Marines die. That's what we're here for. But the Marine Corps lives forever. And that means YOU live forever.
Do you think I'm cute, Private Pyle? Do you think I'm funny?
Sir, no, sir!
Then wipe that disgusting grin off your face.
Sir, yes, sir.
Well, any fucking time, sweetheart!
Sir, I'm trying, sir.
Private Pyle I'm gonna give you three seconds; exactly three-fucking-seconds to wipe that stupid looking grin off your face or I will gouge out your eyeballs and skull-fuck you! ONE! TWO! THREE!
Sir, I can't help it, sir.
Bullshit! Get on your knees scumbag!
Now choke yourself.
Goddamn it, with MY hand, numb-nuts!
Don't pull my fucking hand over there! I said choke yourself; now lean forward and choke yourself!
Are you through grinning?
Sir, yes, sir.
Bullshit, I can't hear you!
Sir, yes, sir.
Bullshit, I STILL can't hear you! Sound off like you've got a pair!
SIR, YES, SIR!
That's enough! Get on your feet. Private Pyle you had best square your ass away and start shitting me Tiffany cufflinks or I will definitely fuck you up!
Sir, yes, sir.
Oh that's right, Private Pyle, don't make any fucking effort to get to the top of the fucking obstacle. If God would have wanted you up there he would have miracled your ass up there by now, wouldn't he?
I don't know but I been told...
I don't know but I been told...

Eskimo pussy is mighty cold.

Feels good.
Today... is Christmas! There will be a magic show at zero-nine-thirty! Chaplain Charlie will tell you about how the free world will conquer Communism with the aid of God and a few Marines! God has a hard-on for Marines because we kill everything we see! He plays His games, we play ours! To show our appreciation for so much power, we keep heaven packed with fresh souls! God was here before the Marine Corps! So you can give your heart to Jesus, but your ass belongs to the Corps! Do you ladies understand?
The deadliest weapon in the world is a Marine and his rifle. It is your killer instinct which must be harnessed if you expect to survive in combat. Your rifle is only a tool. It is a hard heart that kills. If your killer instincts are not clean and strong you will hesitate at the moment of truth. You will not kill. You will become dead marines and then you will be in a world of shit because marines are not allowed to die without permission. Do you maggots understand?
Do any of you people know where these individuals learned how to shoot?... Private Joker.
Sir. In the Marines, Sir.
In the Marines. Outstanding. Those individuals showed what one motivated Marine and his rifle can do. And before you ladies leave my Island, you will all be able to do the same thing.
What's your excuse?
Sir, excuse for what, sir?
I'm asking the fucking questions here, private! Do you understand?
Sir, yes, sir.
Well, thank you very much! Can I be in charge for a while?
Sir, yes, sir.
Left shoulder, hut!
Private Pyle, what are you trying to do to my beloved Corps?
Sir, I don't know, sir!
You are dumb, Private Pyle, but do you expect me to believe that you don't know left from right?
Sir, no, sir!
Then you did that on purpose! You wanna be different!
Sir, no, sir!
What side was that, Private Pyle?
Sir, left side, sir!
Are you sure, Private Pyle?
Sir, yes, sir!
What side was that, Private Pyle?
Sir, right side, sir!
Don't fuck with me again, Pyle! Pick up your fuckin' cover!
Sir, yes, sir!
Are you quitting on me? Well, are you? Then quit, you slimy fucking walrus-looking piece of shit! Get the fuck off of my obstacle! Get the fuck down off of my obstacle! NOW! MOVE IT! Or I'm going to rip your balls off, so you cannot contaminate the rest of the world! I will motivate you, Private Pyle, IF IT SHORT-DICKS EVERY CANNIBAL ON THE CONGO!
What's your name, scumbag?
Sir, Private Brown, sir!
Bullshit! From now on you're Private Snowball. Do you like that name?
Sir, yes, sir!
Well there's one thing that you won't like, Private Snowball: they don't serve fried chicken and watermelon on a daily basis in my mess hall.
Sir, yes, sir!
You best unfuck yourself or I will unscrew your head and shit down your NECK!
What's your sixth general order?
Sir, the private's sixth general order is to receive, obey, and pass on to the sentry who relieves me... all orders - Sir, the private's sixth general order - Sir, the private has been instructed, but he does not know, sir!
You slimy scumbag! Get on your face and give me 25.
Sir, aye-aye, sir!
How many counts in that movement you just executed?
Sir, four counts, sir!
What's the idea of looking down in the chamber?
Sir, that is to guarantee that the private is not giving the inspecting officer a loaded weapon, sir!
What's your fifth general order?
Sir, the private's fifth general order is to quit my post only when properly relieved, sir!
What's this weapon's name, Private Pyle?
Sir, the private's weapon's name is Charlene, sir!
Private Pyle, you are definitely born again hard! Hell, I may even allow you to serve as a rifleman in my beloved Corps.
Sir, yes, sir!
Pickett!
Sir, yes, sir!
0300. Infantry. Toe Jam!
Sir, yes, sir!

4212. Basic Military Journalism. You gotta be shittin' me, Joker. You think you're Mickey Spillane? You think you're some kind of a fuckin' writer?
Sir, I wrote for my high school newspaper, sir!
Jesus H. Christ! You're not a writer. You're a killer!
A killer, yes, sir!
Gomer Pyle. GOMER PYLE!
Sir, yes, sir!
You forget your fuckin' name? 0300. Infantry. You made it.
Are you shook up? Are you nervous?
Sir, I am, sir.
Do I make you nervous?
Sir?
""Sir"" what? Were you about to call me an asshole?
Private Pyle, your ass looks like about a hundred and fifty pounds of chewed bubblegum!
Outstanding, Private Pyle. I think we finally found something that you do well.
Sir, yes, sir!
Get your fat ass up there! I'll bet if there was some pussy up there you would get up there, wouldn't you?
Sir, yes sir!
Jesus H Christ. Private Pyle, why is your footlocker unlocked?
Sir, I don't know, sir.
Private Pyle, if there is one thing in this world that I hate, it is an unlocked footlocker! You know that don't you?
Sir, yes, sir.
If it wasn't for dickheads like you, there wouldn't be any thievery in this world, would there?
Sir, no, sir.
GET DOWN!
One for the Commandant! One for the Corps! Come on Joker, pull! Pull!
I guess the Corps don't get theirs!
Get up there, fat boy!
Come on, Pyle! Pull! Pull! You mean to tell me you can't do one single pull up Pyle? You are a worthless piece of shit, Pyle! Get outta my face!
Do any of you people know who Charles Whitman was? None of you dumbasses knows? Private Cowboy?
Sir, he was that guy who shot all those people from that tower in Austin, Texas, sir!
That's affirmative. Charles Whitman killed twelve people from a twenty-eight-story observation tower at the University of Texas from distances up to four hundred yards. Anybody know who Lee Harvey Oswald was? Private Snowball?
Sir, he shot Kennedy, sir!
That's right, and do you know how far away he was?
Sir, it was pretty far! From that book suppository building, sir!
All right, knock it off! Two hundred and fifty feet! He was two hundred and fifty feet away and shooting at a moving target. Oswald got off three rounds with an old Italian bolt action rifle in only six seconds and scored two hits, including a head shot! Do any of you people know where these individuals learned to shoot? Private Joker?
Sir, in the Marines, sir!
In the Marines! Outstanding! Those individuals showed what one motivated marine and his rifle can do! And before you ladies leave my island, you will be able to do the same thing!
Bullshit. It looks to me like the best part of you ran down the crack of your mama's ass and ended up as a brown stain on the mattress.
As soon as your bunks are done, I want you two turds to clean the head.
Sir, yes, sir.
I want that head so sanitary and squared-away that the Virgin Mary herself would be proud to go in and take a dump.
Reveille! Reveille! Reveille! Drop your Cocks and grab your socks! Today is Sunday! Divine worship is at 0800. Get your bunks made and get your uniforms on! Police call will commence in two minutes!
Do you feel dizzy? Do you feel faint! Jesus H. Christ! I think you've got a hard-on!
Come on, guys. Assholes and elbows.
Pick 'em up and set 'em down Pyle!"
Master Chief John James Urgayle,AA,Drill Sargeant Nasty,"Pain is your friend, your ally, it will tell you when you are seriously injured, it will keep you awake and angry, and remind you to finish the job and get the hell home. But you know the best thing about pain?
Don't know!
It lets you know you're not dead yet!
I never saw a wild thing sorry for itself. A bird will fall frozen dead from a bough without ever having felt sorry for itself.
Master Chief...
Lieutenant, seek life elsewhere.
Suck my dick!
Remember, there are no bad crews, only bad leaders.
Sergeant Cortez, however *brief* your stint with this command might be, there are two words you *will* learn to put together: Team-Mate.
The Israelis tried it. Women in combat. Seems men couldn't get used to the sight of women blown open. They'd linger over the wounded females, often trying to save those who obviously couldn't be saved. Often to the detriment of the mission.
You were given the Navy Cross right? May I ask what you got it for?
Since it bears on this conversation, I got it for pulling a 240-pound man out of a burning tank.
So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero, but if he tries to rescue a woman, he's just gone soft?
Could you have pulled that man clear? Lieutenant, you couldn't even haul your own body weight out of the water today.
I don't know what the hell's been going on in the last 48 hours. And frankly I don't give a shit.
Good to see you too, Master Chief.
The ebb and flow of the Atlantic tides, the drift of the continents, the very position of the sun along its ecliptic. THESE are just a FEW of the things I control in my world! Is that clear?
Yes, Command Master Chief!
IS THAT CLEAR?
YES, COMMAND MASTER CHIEF!
SIXTY PERCENT of you will NOT pass this course! How do I know? Because that is an historical FACT! Now for the bad news, I always like to get *one quitter* on the first day, and until I do, that first day *does not end!*
When I want your opinion, I'll give it to you.
I'll never live this one down.
Instructor Pyro.
Aye aye, Master Chief. Instructors. Boat Crews! Stand by your boats! MOVE YOUR ASSES!
Is there anything *else* we can do for your celebrity career, Lieutenant?
That will be all...
You now have exactly *one minute* to *muster*!
If even *one* of you Van Winkle wannabes are late I will *personally* see to it *none* of you sleep for a week!"

You just made the list, buddy. And I don't like nobody touching my stuff. So just keep your meat-hooks off. If I catch any of you guys in my stuff, I'll kill you. Also, I don't like nobody touching me. Now, any of you homos touch me, and I'll kill you.
Lighten up, Francis.
Okay, Mr. Push-ups, let's hear your story.
Chicks dig me, because I rarely wear underwear and when I do it's usually something unusual. But now I know why I have always lost women to guys like you. I mean, it's not just the uniform. It's the stories that you tell. So much fun and imagination.
Lee Harvey, you are a madman. When you stole that cow, and your friend tried to make it with the cow. I want to party with you, cowboy. If the two of us together, forget it. I'm gonna go out on a limb here. I'm gonna volunteer my leadership to this platoon. An army without leaders is like a foot without a big toe. And Sergeant Hulka isn't always gonna be here to be that big toe for us. I think that we owe a big round of applause to our newest, bestest buddy, and big toe... Sergeant Hulka.
Well, okay, hot shot. We're gonna see what kind of soldier you are. Reveille is O five hundred. We're going to fall out with locker boxes and we're going to have a locker box inspection. And then we're going to do ten miles. Rain or shine! So, you better hit them bunks my little babies. Or, Sgt Hulka with the big toe is going to see how far he can stick it up your ass!
Men, welcome to the United States Army. I'm Sergeant Hulka. I'm your drill sergeant. Before we proceed any further, we gotta get something straight. Your mamas are not here to take care of you now. It's just you, me, and Uncle Sam. And before I leave you, you're gonna find out that me and Uncle Sam are one in the same.
Uncle Hulka?
You know something soldier, I've noticed that you're always last.
I'm pacing myself, Sergeant.
Move it!
I joined the army 'cause my father and my brother were in the army. I thought I'd better join before I got drafted.
Son, there ain't no draft no more.
There was one?
You better hit those bunks my little babies, or Sergeant Hulka with the ""big toe"" is gonna see how far he can stick it up your ass.
I'm getting too old for this shit.
We got a full day ahead of us. We're gonna start out with a five-mile run.
I know that I'm speaking for the entire platoon when I say this run should be postponed until this platoon is better rested.
Well, I'll tell you what, soldier. Let's make it ten miles.
You don't say ""sir"" to me, I'm a sergeant, I work for a living.
Yes, sergeant!
I didn't hear you!
*Yes, sergeant*!
*That's* what I wanna hear.
Do you think this guy's over-doing it a bit?
I'm talking about something important, like discipline and duty and honor and courage. And you ain't got none of it!
Those words mean so much to a man who scrubs garbage cans. Look, if you don't want me in your Army, kick me out, but get off my back.
Maybe you'd like to take a swing at me.
I 'd like to take a BIG swing at you, sarge.
Well, go ahead and give it your best shot.
I don't think I want to go to the stockade.
I'll take my hat off. There we are, Winger. Ain't no more drill sergeant. It's just you and me, kid, man to man. So go ahead, give it your best shot. Swing at me. Gutless. Punk!
I'm willing to forget this little incident. And I want you to think real hard about it. And maybe someday you'll understand what the hell I'm talking about.
When I tell you move, you'll move fast. When I tell you to jump, you're gonna say, ""How high?"" And make no mistake. I don't care where you come from, I don't care what color you are, I don't care how smart you are, I don't care how dumb you are, 'cause I'm gonna teach every last one of you how to eat, sleep, walk, talk, shoot, shit like a United States soldier. Understand?
Yes, sir.
Now, since nobody else has got the guts...
...to admit it, the rest of this platoon... will do the next two weekends on KP.
How's that sound to you, mister?
I think it sucks.
You're all in this together!
One of these men may save your life one of these days. You understand that?
Then again, maybe one of us won't.
Sergeant, we've traced the EM-50 to Germany. They're probably heading for East Berlin.
Sir, if you'll take my advice, there's a crack squad in the 42nd. It can link up with the air recon. We'd have that EM-50 back here in this side of 24 hours.
Nothing doing. If we went to outside units, we'd be the laughing stock of the entire armed forces. We will do this our selves.
Sir, those numb nuts can't even tie their own shoelaces."
Sergeant Thomas Highway,AA,Drill Sargeant Nasty,"Thank you for your testimony, Officer Reese. Sergeant Highway, drunk and disorderly. Fighting in a public establishment. Urinating on a police vehicle?
Well, it seemed like the thing to do, sir.
Just because there's no war going on does not give you the right to start one every time you get drunk. Now I'm taking into account your excellent military record and your commitment to the security of this great nation. But this is your last chance. One hundred dollar fine. Next!
Your nightstick file for divorce, Reese?
Who the hell do you think you are? Pissin' on my squad car. You think you can break our rules and then just walk away? Or are we supposed to wet our pants over your dress blues and your Goddamn colored ribbons. Take a look at that file of yours sometime, hero. Check the dates. It's ancient fucking history. You know, one of these Saturday nights you're going to be puking blood in some alley and you're going to look up and see me standing there. Then we'll see.
Keep dreaming, shit ball.
You're gonna pay full price rummy. I don't believe in no serviceman's discounts.
Too bad, your old lady does.
I don't like soldier boys.
Say what?
If you wanna pop that puppy's can you don't have to grease him so hard, jarhead.
Well, it sounds like you're a man of experience.
What the hell's that supposed to mean, grunge shit.
It means: Be advised. I'm mean, nasty and tired. I eat concertina wire and piss napalm and I can put a round in a flea's ass at 200 meters. So why don't you go hump somebody else's leg, mutt face, before I push yours in.
Ain't gonna be so smart with your balls stuffed in your mouth, jarhead!
Hang on to this, boy. I think war's just been declared.
Gunny, I'm afraid of heights.
So am I.
You are?
Jumping out of a perfectly good aircraft is not a natural act. So let's do it right, enjoy the view. Come on.
I been pumping pussy since Christ was a corporal. I can tell you, the best damned poontang I ever paid for was in Da Nang. The girls were checked out daily. And we got ourself laid in a safe, orderly, proficient, military manner. That is until some suckhead writes home mama and says he dipped his wick in the Republic of South Vietnam. Then the shit hits the fan. A committee of congressmen who asshole to asshole who couldn't make a beer fart in a whirlwind, start telling your basic-ass-in-the-grass, Marine ""No more short time"". We responded in true Marine Corps fashion. We salute, do an about face, double time back to the boom-boom garbage dump where we get the clap, and the drip, and the crabs and a generally poor attitude towards the female of the species. War is hell, boy. That's a fact!
Your DD 1348 forms are not filled out correctly.
Yes, sir.
We're going to approach this exercise in an orderly proficiant manner, Sergeant Major. I want each round of ammunition counted and returned in the exact condition in which it was received.
I'll personally dot the I's and cross the T's, sir.
Sloppiness breeds inefficiency.
Your outfit looks like it could use some cleaning up, Gunny.
Sir, I'd like to issued my squad leader a set of night vision goggles.
Darn, I should have thought of that.
That is not part of your TO&E.;
But, sir, I...
Fill out the proper request forms and send it through the chain of command!
Request forms!
Atten-shun! Major Malcom Powers, sir. Annapolis class of '71.
How are men doing, Major?
My men are ready to fight to the death to defend our country, sir.
Well, let's hope that won't be necessary.
Have we ever served together?
I don't know, sir. Sergeant Major Choozoo and I were in the 2nd Battalion and 7th in '68.
I had a rifle company in the 1st Battalion and 7th in '68.
Well, we sure as hell chewed some of the same dirt, sir.
That's for sure. What's your assessment of this exercise?
It's a cluster fuck.
Say again?
Marines are fighting men, sir. They shouldn't be sitting around on their sorry asses filling out request forms for equipment they should already have.
Interesting observation. Carry on, Major.
Now hear this. Now hear this.
This is it. We're going to war.
My name's Gunnery Sergeant Highway and I've drunk more beer and banged more quiff and pissed more blood and stomped more ass that all of you numbnuts put together. Now Major Powers has put me in charge of this reconisence platoon.
We take care of ourselves.
You couldn't take care of a wet dream. God loves you.
I know that!
You men do not impress me!
Recon platoon kicks butt.
If you ladies think that you can slip and slide just because your last sergeant was a pussy, well queer bait, you're going to start acting like Marines right now!
Who invited ya!
I'm not doing this because I want to take long showers with you assholes and I don't want to get my head shot off in some far away land because you don't habla, comprende?
Ruh!
You?
Yes, Gunney.
And you really look so fine and you've got that big behind.
Well, well, well, well. I'm here to tell you that life as you knew it has ended. You all may as well go into town tonight. You may as well laugh and make fools out of yourselves. Rub your pathetic little peckers against your honies or stick it in a knothole in the fence but whatever it is, get rid of it. Because at 0600 tomorrow your ass is mine.
Where's your bunk.
Where is it?
Where's what, man?
The money for my ticket.
Hey, no need to resort to unnecessary violence. I was a little down on the money, you know, but I got a little money for you right here. But that's all I got.
And the meal.
The meal.
Yeah, the meal.
Ok, I got a little more for you here but that's definitely all I got.
And the tip.
No, man, that's really it that's all I got.
You owe me.
Now it's my will against yours and you will lose. So don't forget, 0600. That's six o'clock in the morning for those of you who don't habla.
Major Powers and I are building an e-lite company of fighting men.
The only thing you could build, Webster... is a good case of hemorrhoids.
Just because we're holding hands doesn't mean we'll be taking warm showers together until the wee hours of the morning.
Highway, I heard you was back.
Webster.
These retards couldn't fight their way out of a shit house.
That where you been keeping yourself lately?
Major Powers and me are building an elite company of fightin' men.
Webster, the only thing you could build is a good case of hemmorhoids.
What? What?
Well, you're blowing away all of your ammunition, Fag-eddy. Miss I ain't America's gonna make Swiss cheese out of you.
It's not my fuckin' fault, man. The fuckin' weapon's fuckin' fucked up.
There's nothing wrong with that rifle. Keep it tight.
You wake up this morning with a piss pot on your head?
Uh, no, Gunny, I wore this in your honor.
Is that right?
Yeah, you know, Sands of Iwo Jima, Pork Chop Hill, Kason, all that old antique shit. Sort of a tribute to an aging veteran close to retirement such as yourself.
Well, I'm touched.
Yeah, you know, sort of a recon way of saying welcome and ineveitably, goodbye.
And the kevlar helmet you were issued, that didn't by chance find it's way into one of the local pawn shops in town now did it?
Hey, hey, yo, that's a serious implication, Gunny. You know, we're financially responsible for these bad boys.
That's right, you are, that's why I want to see kevlar on your head by 1900 hours or you won't have a head to put it on.
Yes, sir, Gunny Highway Sergeant, sir!
Hey, Gunny. My weapon's jammed!
Major Powers' gonna teach you how to discipline your men.
Webster, if Powers ever comes to a sudden stop your face is gonna go half way up his ass.
Profile's never gonna make it back to the barracks.
Powers is cold blooded, man.
Come on, Profile. You can make it. Don't give the prick the satisfaction.
Hey crotch rot! You gonna slurp my lifer's juice out of my own cup?
Yeah, I guess I should have gotten shots before hand.
If your brain was half as smart as your mouth, skunk stool, you'd be a frickin' twenty star general by now.
And if I were half as ugly as your, Sergeant Major, I'd be a poster boy for a profilactic.
Still a mean and nasty bastard! Goddamn! Good to see you, Tom. Back where you belong!
Easy now, or everyone's gonna thing I'm spoken for.
Ten-hut! Morning, sir!
Sergeant Major.
Coffee, sir?
Negative.
Gunnery Sergeant Thomas Highway, reporting for duty, sir.
That operations officer's fart hole's sewed so tight he shits out of his mouth.
Academy?
Big time football hero.
When am I ever going to get a break?
Never.
Sergeant Major!
Sir!
Bring in Gunnery Sergeant Highway.
Been in a long time.
I've felt some heat, sir.
Korea. Dominican. Three tours in 'Nam. Hell, this old ass in the grass bulldog's carrying around so much shrapnel he can't pass through an airport metal detector.
I haven't as yet had the privelige of combat. I've recently come over from supply and logistics.
An unappreciated field of endevour, sir.
Quite. My record of achievement thus far as been exemplary. I fully intend for that to continue.
Sir?
At ease. That'll be all Sergeant Major.
Aye, aye, sir.
Oh, for Christ sake Highway, relax. Stop being so damn gung ho.
That's what I am, sir.
What do you got about 24 in now Highway?
And then some, sir.
You know, some men in your position might look forward to retirement. Maybe think about taking the wife on an around the world cruise. But that's not your way, is it? No. Instead you choose to harrang my staff with a request for transfer to a fleet marine force unit. In fact the very unit you got busted out of some time ago for insubordination. Conduct unbecoming.
That's true, major, I have had my differences with some limp dicks.
Highway!
You know, I truly don't know whether to admire ya or resent the living hell out of of ya. Well, I guess it doesn't matter either way because you are out of here effective immediately.
Where to, sir?
2nd Recon Battalion. 2nd Marine Division. You're goin' home.
Yes, sir!
Gunny Highway.
Sir?
Be careful what you wish for. You might just get it.
I want this battalion to be the class of the division. I expect my non-commissioned officers to lead by example. Public fighting and insubordination to civilian authority are not what I call good standards!
It was a minor altercation, sir.
That seems to be a habit with you, Gunny! A year ago you hit an officer. I went to Annapolis with that man. You try that with me, Gunnery Sergeant Highway and you'll drag your butt in a sling for a month, you hear me, marine?
Yes, sir.
I don't know what strings you pulled to get back into this division but I can assure you that I don't like it. This is the new Marine Corps. The new breed. Characters like you are an anachronism. You should be sealed in a case that reads break glass only in the event of war. Got no tolerance for you old timers who think that you know it better and can have it all your own way. Understand?
I understand a lot of body bags get filled if I don't go my job, sir.
Major, division has assigned Gunny Highway to our reconisance platoon.
Yes, recon. Their last sergeant was an old time combat vet, too. But he went road on me. Retired on active duty. Had a few months to retirement. Figured he'd coast. Allowed the men to lapse into mediocrity. You're close to mandatory retirement yourself, aren't you, Highway?
That's right, Major.
Well, I ask for Marines, the division sends me relics. The men in recon platoon are less than highly motivated to say the least. I want those men in shape.
I'll make life takers and heart breakers out of them, sir.
Dismissed.
Is he always like that or is he just trying to make a good impression?
Word is that he consults the Marine Corps Manual before he mounts his old lady just to make sure that he performs in an...
, :
orderly proficiant military manner.
, :
orderly proficiant military manner.
Yeah, eat chow with Helen and me tonight, she can't wait to see you. Then later we'll go out and stomp some brain cells and tell some stories.
Well, I'd like to, Chooz, but I think I better get organized.
Sure, I understand.
If you pull another shithead stunt like that again, the only thing that'll beat you to the brig is the headlights on the ambulance you'll be riding in.
What did you say to him?
I said ""Don't give the prick the satisfaction,"" sir!
Excuse me, sir. I mean, Gunny. Sergeant Major
Sir. This is Gunnery Sergent Thomas Highway. He's been assigned to Recon Platoon.
Oh, outstanding, welcome aboard. Well, I have to hightail it men. I'm late for pre-SCUBA school.
Lord!
His Mama know he's playing Marine?
By the way, he's Lt. Ring. Your platoon leader.
Thanks a lot.
You didn't think you were just gonna tilt nipple to a bunch of no rank fuzz butts did you?
I guess not.
Want me to intro you to your troops.
No, I'll take care of it.
Here, take my pickup.
Hey, thanks. Where is it?
You can tell by the sign. It says Sergeant Major.
Hey, Baby. You fool around on the first date?
Oooooo.
Damn you, boy, don't you know how to write or call?
Well, I didn't want you to spend any sleepless nights thinking about me.
Come on, I'll get you a beer.
Great. I could use one.
You look great. They don't make 'em like you anymore.
Oh, hell, sure they do. But if you want a lot from a woman you have to give a lot.
Not this kid. It seems that marriage and the Marine Corps weren't too compatable.
Panther piss. The best years of my life were spent with a Marine. If I were a little younger I'd make you eat your words and curl your toes.
I bet you could.
Aggie always kept a smile on your face.
That was pain.
She's in town Tom.
I figured as much. Well, if she's looking for more alimony she's in real trouble because I've got myself so broke I couldn't get out of sight if it took a quarter to go around the world.
She's cocktailin' over at the Palace.
I figured she'd be married to a general by now. Can I get my old room back?
Hell yes. You gonna go see her?
Hell no. Can I run a tab on this?
Hell no.
Tough woman. Tough, tough woman.
Just about cleaned you out. Sure makes you feel good, don't it, Gunny? Helping Uncle Sam battle dirty drawers.
You pump the neighbor's dog again, Jakes, or are you always slack eyed and silly in the afternoon.
Looks like you could use a little lift, Highway. Why don't you suck on one of these. Smooth as a prom queen's thigh only not quite as risky. Havana cured. Gotta pal over in Guantanamo in supply. We do each other favors. I've got lots of friends. Of course, I could always use another friend.
So that we can do each other favors?
Sure. See, if your pencil wasn't quite so sharp and your eyesight not quite so clear around here I could make your lot in the military life a lot more comfy. Not to mention down right rewardin'.
Sergeant, you get that contraband stogie out of my face before I shove it so far up your ass you'll have to set fire to your nose to light it.
Gunny Highway! Major Devin wants to see you ASAP.
I can't fix it if I don't know what's broken.
This is the AK-47 assault rifle, the preferred weapon of your enemy; and it makes a distinctive sound when fired at you, so remember it.
Why don't I bend you over the table there... send you home with the ""I just pumped the neighbor's cat"" look on your face.
You know one of these days you'll be puking blood in some alley and you're going to look up and see me standing there!
Keep dreaming, shitball!
You're going to pay full price Rummy! I don't give no serviceman's discount!
That's too bad, your old lady does.
Shut your face, hippie!
Hippie?
There haven't been hippies in centuries. Are you freeze-dried or doing hard time?
Get in there. Tell them who you are, so no friendlies get hurt.
Hello happening hostages! I'm Stitch Jones, Mr. Funkadelic!
Try ""U.S. Marine"", shithead...
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
Just enjoying the view, sir.
Well, you disobeyed an order. I told you to stay in contact and not take this hill without me. Damn it! Get on your feet, Highway!
With all due respect, sir, you're beginning to bore the hell out of me.
Who's in charge here?
I am, sir. Major Malcolm Powers.
Did you lead this assault?
Sir, Leutenant Ring and Gunnery Sergeant Highway disobeyed a direct order. I told them to wait for support but they went up this hill anyway.
Why?
We're Marines, sir. We're paid to adapt, to improvise.
Sir, I gave the order to take this hill.
Ring, this is going to ruin your career.
Are you new to the infantry, Major?
Yes, sir. Just came over from supply.
Were you good at that?
Yes, sir!
Well then, stick to it because you're a walking cluster fuck as an infantry officer. My men are hard chargers, Major! Leutenant Ring and Gunny Highway took a handfull of young fire pissers, exercised some personal initiative and kicked ass!
Good job, Leutenant!
Thank you, sir!
Leutenant, see to it that those students are escorted back to Cherry Point.
Yes, sir!
Well, you're dismissed!
What the hell are you two sorry assed individuals looking at? Get the hell off of my LZ.
, :
Semper Fi!
, :
Semper Fi!
Oo-rah!
Well, Chooz, I guess we're not 0-1-1 anymore.
This man has usurped authority and ignored my personal directives for over a week. Why, Lieutenant?
Sir, I thought the training exercise was...
You think too much and act too little. You are supposed to be an officer. Now look that word up in your platoon leader's handbook.
Who gave you permission to deviate from the training schedule?
I needed to evaluate my men, sir.
They're not your men, you self-centered, egocentric, son-of-a-bitch! They're the United States Marine Corps men! The Second Division's men! The Eighth Marine Regiment's men! In other words, they're MY men and SO ARE YOU, GET IT?
The only thing I'll get is my head shot off if I go into a hot landing zone with a platoon that doesn't know it's job.
You will follow my training program to the letter. No questions asked.
You go into combat tomorrow and you'll plant half those men.
You did it on your own, didn't you?
I can't fix it if I don't know what's broken.
Well, you make it easy.
Sir, I gave the Gunny permission to freelance his, I mean, the men, sir.
Wait outside, Ring.
I'm going to run you out of the corps, Highway. And you know what's funny? You're going to do all the work. Sooner or later you'll disregard procedure, disobey an order, or just get drunk. You can't help it. You're too old, too prideful, too stupid to change. I'm going to enjoy seeing you fall, Highway. Now get out and send in that idiot, Ring.
He wants to see you, Lieutenant.
Sorry.
No reason to be. Lieutenant? Recon!
You're dead, marine. You just stepped on four booby traps that blew your legs off and we'll have to send out a search party for your testicles. Now, where the hell's your backup?
Profile.
What the fuck good you doin' back there? Without any cover fire, I get my ass blown off! While you guys are sittin' there pumpin' the neighbor's dog, we'll get every swinging dick in this platoon killed!
Hey, chill out, man. That's what we're here for.
Say, what?
We're here for that, man. We've ambushed Major Powers three times, and always right here. We know what we're doing.
Well, shit-for-brains, who says we're gonna ambush Major Powers right here?
Hey, didn't you hear Lieutenant Ring? Major Powers wants us to die in a loud, grotesque, military manner.
I don't give a fuck about Major Powers. My job is to keep you men alive, now let's move on.
We'll come to the ambush site over the next hill.
Roger that.
Sure does help knowing when and where you're gonna be hit, sir.
Easy. Give them a few more yards and we'll nail the coffin shut. Now.
You're in the wrong ambush site! Cease fire! You're in the wrong ambush site!
Sergeant Major, turn this damn thing off.
Makes a hell of a racket, doesn't it, sir?
Sir, I'll wait outside for the MPs to come.
Negative, Johanson! You're going to become a Marine, right now.

Fall out...
Yes, sir.
Good morning, men!
Thank you, Gunny. What a marvelous day for a military exercise. Men, today we'll will execute an ambush on a numerically superior force using cover, interlocking fields of fire, and the natural aggressiveness of the United States Marine.
You show me some poontang and I'll show you an aggressive Marine.
We will provide Major Powers and his elite fighting force an accessible target to sharpen their superior skills. This will be facilitated by the MILES gear that each man is wearing. As you know, when one of our men is shot this laser sensitive device emits a beeping noise.
Excuse me, Lieutenant, but are you suggesting that we don't fight back?
Well, no, Gunny, Major Powers like to use the Recon platoon as a training tool.
Well, what happens when these men have to go into combat and they're not prepared? They just get dead.
Yes, I see what you mean.
Have you spoken to Major Powers about this?
Let's move them out, Gunny.
Are you coming with us, Lieutenant?
Uh, no, Gunny. I have a doctor's appointment at 1100.
Well, let's hope it's not something that'll keep you out of the next war. Platoon, ten-hut! Sling arms! Right face! Forward march!
Bad sex, bad whiskey and bad marriages, I never forget.
You never talked dirty like that when we were married.
Yes I did; you were just never around to hear it.
Gunny, did you know that I was Platoon Leader in my ROTC class in college?
I'll sleep a lot better at night knowing that, sir.
Thank you.
Ow! What school did you go to?
Heartbreak Ridge.
Hmmm. I've never heard of that school.
Sergeant, you get that contraband stokey out of my face, or I'll shove it up your ass so far you'll have to set fire to your nose to light it.
All secured, sir. No casualties, no sign of enemy.
Very good. I want to get some pictures before we wrap this mission.
We encountered some heavy resistance along the way, sir.
Probably some local fanatics.
Negative. Cuban regulars with Russian rifles.
That data's already been factored in.
Sir, Battalion!
Go ahead.
Big daddy says to get off your fat ass and get back in the war. His words. He says he wants to recon that hill. One of our fly boys thinks he saw some armor.
You're full of all kinds of good news.
You're too ugly to live forever!"
Maj. John Reisman,AA,Drill Sargeant Nasty,"We were on patrol in this village. There we five men. Officers. They had this young girl trapped. They each took their turns with her. None of us did nothin' to stop 'em. You see, they were white officers, we were negro soldiers. When they finished, they got into their Jeep and... just drove away. Something just happened inside me.
You hit a lieutenant in the back of the head at 220 yards. That's a nice shot.
The Army didn't think so.
But they're prejudiced. I'm not.
You've got a record like a roll of toilet paper. AWOL, desertion of post, striking an NCO, refusing to take orders, drunk on duty, assaulting a superior officer, resulting in his death. And yet you managed to get yourself the Silver Star, Purple Heart, Bronze Star. You've got a lot of talent. You just don't know how to use it. But I do.
Tell me, son, what happened between you and the Sergeant?
We were in a bar. I'd been drinking. He was calling me names.
That a reason to kill 'im?
I would like to die like an American soldier.
You've got a good chance of doing just that.
Recruiting new victims, Major? Heard all about your last mission. Yeah, twelve go out, only one comes home. Those are lousy odds.
It's a lousy war. This is a lousy prison. And you have a lousy future.
You ain't offering me nothin' better.
Oh, come on, Dregors. It'll be more fun than you've had in years.
Hand grenade and hookers? That ain't my style.
But shooting an officer in the back of the head is?
Perkins, sir. Conrad E.
What's he in for?
Thirty years of hard labor for robbery, sir.
Who'd he rob?
American soldiers, sir. Dead ones.
You let me in there, Sergeant. I'll kill 'im myself.
Didn't seem like much at the time. Just a few souvenirs.
Yeah, I know, I've done it myself. Only the Army calls it looting.
Would the General mind stop playing with his choo-choo and tell me what I'm supposed to do?
For those of you who forgot, my name is Reisman. You have all volunteered for a mission that gives you three ways to go. You can foul up during training, you can foul up in action, in which case I will blow your brains out, or you can do as you're told. In which case you may just get by. This is your new home. Do not try to escape. There will be no excuse, no appeal. Any attempt by one of you and you will all be sent directly back to prison for execution of sentence. You are therefore dependent upon each other. Any one of you try anything smart, and you all get it right in the neck. Am I clear?"
Ben Stone,BI,Slacker,"Do you want to do it doggie style?
You're not going to fuck me like a dog.
It's doggie style. It's just the style. We don't have to go outside or anything.
and then your Mommy said, ""Just do it already!"" which was very confusing to Daddy, so I took the most literal translation.
But between you and me, it was the smartest thing I ever did, 'cause now you're here.
Just don't ask me to lend you any money.
Can I just - have some?
I love you. You're the best thing that ever happened to me.
I'm the best thing that's ever happened to you?
Yes.
Now I'm starting to feel a little sorry for YOU...
This isn't funny. This guy's got twelve kids, that's not funny. That's a lot of responsibility to just be... laughing about. This is sick. This is a sick movie. I gotta turn this off. It's freaking me out.
I was drunk!
Was your vagina drunk?
Yeah, it's a cure-all. My buddy Jonah broke his elbow one time. He just smoked some weed. It still clicks, but it's cool.
Whatever. I'm glad I'm not a Jew.
So are we...
You weren't chosen for a reason.
Hey Doc Howard, Ben Stone calling, guess what the fuck's up? Allison is going into labor and you are not fucking here, you know where you're at? Your at a fucking bar mitzvah in San Francisco you motherfucking piece of shit, and you know what I'm gonna have to do now? I'm going have to kill you, I'm gonna pop a fucking cap in your ass. You're dead, you're Tupac, you are fucking Biggie you piece of shit, I hope you fucking die or drop the chair and kill that fucking kid... I hope your plane crashes, peace fucker!
I'd like to be in there with Alison without you.
OK. I understand how you feel, but this isn't up to you.
Look, Debbie. You are high off your ass if you think you're coming into that room. If you take one step towards that door, I will tell security there's a crazy chick in a pink dress snatching up babies, ok? So don't even try to come into that room, that's my room now. That little area with the Pepsi machine, that's your area. My room, your area, stay in your area, stay out of my room, back... the... fuck... off.
Why don't you go fuck your fucking bong you fuck!
I will! I'll do it doggy style, too! For once!
I gotta go, Sadie might have the chicken pox.
I had the chicken pox THREE times. I have no immunity to it.
We don't have the heart to tell him it's herpes.
It's not herpes if it's everywhere.
Fuck you, hormones!
I'm pregnant.
Fuck off!
What?
What?
Your face looks like Robin Williams' knuckles.
I'm pregnant.
Pregnant... with emotion?
Pregnant with a baby.
We got pinkeye.
Were you giving butterfly kisses or something?
Ha ha ha, very funny That's not how you get pinkeye. You get it from poo particles making their way into your ocular cavities.
Um, I farted on Jason's pillow as a practical joke. He farted on Jonah's, thinking it was mine, and then eventually pinkeyed my pillow. I'm not proud any of this, but I think we're all forgiven each other. Um, but we can't go anywhere.
You can get pinkeye from farting in a pillow?
Totally!
That's awesome!
Jesus, Martin got it bad. What, did someone take a dump on your eye?
No. No pinkeye for me. I'm just really... high.
I live in your phone!
You know, the best thing for a hangover is weed. Do you smoke weed?
Not really.
You don't?
No.
At all?
Uh-uh.
Like... in the morning?
No... I just... don't.
It is, like, the best medicine. 'Cause it fixes everything. Jonah broke his elbow once. We just... got high and... it still clicks but, I mean, he's ok.
I'm sorry I told you to fuck your bong.
It's okay... I didn't...
What do you think? He's funny, right?
Fetch!
He's playing fetch... with my kids... he's treating my kids like they're dogs.
I love your curly hair! It's great... do you use product or anything?
No... I use, uh, jew it's called.
What time is it?
7:30
Why the fuck are we awake? Let's go back to sleep.
I have to go to work.
Really?
Uh, do you need to... get to work or anything?
No, I'm uh... no work today hahahaha.
I'm actually doing my first on-air interview today.
With who?
Uh, Matthew Fox.
Matthew Fox from Lost?
Yeah.
You know what's interesting about him?
What?
Nothing!
You know how they say to never drink and drive? Well, never drink and bone.
I hope your apartment's big enough for the three of us.
Oh it definitely is. That's why I got one in East LA. The rent, it's HUGE. The only thing is we have to decide if we're gonna be Crips or Bloods before we get there.
Well, I look good in red.
I look good in blue... The fighting continues.
I'm sorry I'm sweating on you...
Okay, just stop talking.
Now that's how you get pink eye.
You're going to be embarrassed when you realize I'm Wilmer Valderama.
If any of us get laid tonight, it's because of Eric Bana in ""Munich.""
I wish I liked anything as much as my kids like bubbles.
That's sad.
Totally sad. Their smiling faces just point out your inability to enjoy anything.
How long you kids been married?
We're not married.
Are you single?
She's not single, she's just not married.
Are you two together?
That guy said 'Don't let the door hit your vagina on the way out!'
I heard him.
There are five different types of chairs in this hotel room.
That's way too many chairs for one room!
Our baby is going to be French Canadian.
And a little bit Spanish...?
Yeah, I'm not very good with accents.
You mean like Mr. Skin?
Who's Mr. Skin?
You know, Mr. Skin...
Did you know there's a guy whose sole job is to find chairs for these hotel rooms?
Please take the chairs away.
Like this one! It's red with gold stripes and -
oh, this one is amazing!
Please take the chairs away. I don't like them. The big one is staring at me and that short one is being very droll.
Hey...
I'm naked.
Yeah.
Did we have sex?
Yes.
Nice.
FUCK ME!
Oh Hey! What up dawg?
Where have you been?
Around, you know... just kinda doing my thing!
Why is everybody so mad at you?
I don't know are they mad what have they been saying?
They've been saying like Blah, blah, blah, blah blah. Ben's a prick.
They said that?
A lot!
That sucks!
What does it mean?
Penis... means penis
Oh...
Penis
Isn't weird how chairs exist even when you're not sitting on them?
Hello?
Hey! What's up, Daddy? What are you doing?
Just smoking a joint. Drinking some beers. You know? Rockin.
I'm gonna throw you in my DeLorean and gun it to 88.
VRRROOOOM
Oh yeah... It's a girl. Buy some pink shit!
No, these guys can honk all they want, I ain't going faster than 12. It might take us around three hours to get home, though.
That's because Steely Dan Gargles my balls.
Why don't you go FUCK your FUCKING Bong?
I will! I'll do it doggy style, too! For once!
You think I'm an inventor? ""He created a dick-skin condom, He hollowed out a penis and put it on"", what the fuck?"
Shaun,BI,Slacker,"David, kill the Queen!
What?
The jukebox!
As Mr. Sloan always says, there is no ""I"" in team, but there is an ""I"" in pie. And there's an ""I"" in meat pie. Anagram of meat is team... I don't know what he's talking about.
'Purple Rain'?
No.
'Sign o' the Times'?
Definitely not.
The 'Batman' soundtrack?
Throw it.
'Dire Straits'?
Throw it.
Ooh, 'Stone Roses'.
Um, No.
'Second Coming'.
I like it!
Ahhh! 'Sade'.
Yeah, but that's Liz's!
Yeah, but she did dump you.
Oh!
What's the plan then?
Right.
We take Pete's car, we drive over to Mum's, we go in, take care of Philip - ""I'm so sorry, Philip"" - then we grab Mum, we go over to Liz's place, hole up, have a cup of tea and wait for this whole thing to blow over.
Why have we got to go to Liz's?
Because we do.
But she dumped you!
I have to know if she's all right!
Why?
Because I love her!
All right... gayyy... I'm not staying there, though.
Why not?
If we hole up, I wanna be somewhere familiar, I wanna know where the exits are, and I wanna be allowed to smoke.
Okay.
We take Pete's car, go round Mum's, go in, deal with Philip - ""Sorry, Philip!"" - grab Mum, go to Liz's, pick her up, bring her back here, have a cup of tea and wait for this whole thing to blow over.
Perfect!
No, no, no, no, no, wait, we can't bring her back here.
Why not?
Well, it's not really safe, is it?
Yeah, look at the state of it.
Where's safe? Where's familiar?
Where can I smoke?
Take car. Go to Mum's. Kill Phil - ""Sorry."" - grab Liz, go to the Winchester, have a nice cold pint, and wait for all of this to blow over. How's that for a slice of fried gold?
Yeah, boyyyeee!
He's not my boyfriend!
It might be a bit warm, the cooler's off.
Thanks, babe.
As Bertrand Russell once said, ""The only thing that will redeem mankind is cooperation."" I think we can all appreciate the relevance of that now.
Was that on a beer mat?
Yeah, it was Guinness Extra Cold.
I won't say anything.
Thanks.
Any zombies out there?
Don't say that!
What?
That!
What?
The zed-word. Don't say it!
Why not?
Because it's ridiculous!
All right... are there any out there, though?
I can't see any. Maybe it's not as bad as all that.
Oh, no, there they are.
Shaun?
Yeah?
You see what I'm saying?
Yep, totally.
I know he's your best friend, but you do live with him.
I know.
It's not that I don't like Ed.
Ed, it's not that I don't like you.
It's all right.
It would just be nice if we could...
Fuck!
...spend a bit more time together...
Bollocks!
...just the two of us.
Cock it!
It's just with Ed here, it's no wonder I always bring my flat-mates out and then that only exacerbates things.
What do you mean?
Well you guys hardly get on, do you?
No, what does ""exacerbate"" mean?
It means um, to make things worse.
Right. Well I mean, it's not that I don't like David and Di.
Guys, it's not that I don't like you.
, :

It's all right.
, :

It's all right.
And it's not that I don't want to spend time with you cause I do. It's just... Ed doesn't have too many friends.
Can I get... any of you cunts... a drink?
It's four in the fucking morning!
It's Saturday!
No, it's not. It's fucking Sunday. And I've got to go to fucking work in four fucking hours 'cos every other fucker in my fucking department is fucking ill! Now can you see why I'm SO FUCKING ANGRY?
Fuck, yeah!
Hey, Shaun, look who it is!
Fuck-a-doodle-do!
Do you want anything from the shop?
Cornetto.
Okay. But dogs CAN look up!
Do you want your messages?
What?
Well, your mum rang about you going around tomorrow night, and then Liz rang about the two of you eating out tonight, and then your mum rang back to see if I wanted to eat her out tonight.
*What*?
Feel free to step in any time!
You did all right.
I didn't want to cramp your style.
Are you all right?
Come on, let's just go.
Hello?
He's going to be dead either way.
Ed, that's not the point!
Oh, thank God for that.
I've known him since primary school, you know? I like having him around, he's a laugh.
What, because he can impersonate an orangutan? Fuck-a-doodle-doo!
Oh, leave him alone.
All right, I admit, he can pretty funny on occasion. Like that time we stayed up all night drinking apple Schnappes and playing Tekken 2.
Oh yeah.
When was that?
That was five years ago. When's he going home?
Look, I don't care what the telly says, all right? We *have* to get out of here. If we don't they'll tear us to pieces, and that is really going to exacerbate things for all of us.
Come and get it! It's a running buffet!
All you can eat!
Goodbye, Ed. Love you.
Cheers!
I love you too, man.
Gaaayy!
Some men tried to get into the house.
Well are they still there?
I'm not sure, we've shut the curtains.
Did you try the police?
Well I thought about it.
Are you OK? Did they hurt you?
No I'm fine. I'm fine.
Mum...
Well they were a bit... bitey.
Mum, have you been bitten?
No... But Philip has.
Oh, OK.
Has she been bitten?
No, Philip has.
Oh, OK.
Listen, Mum, what sort of state is he in?
Oh, he's fine. Bit under the weather.
I see.
What's the deal?
We may have to kill my step-dad.
Why didn't you just shoot him, man?
Ed, for the last time...
I fucking knew it!
You hang out with my friends? Sorry, a failed actress and a twat?
Well, that's a bit harsh.
Your words!
I did NOT call Dianne a failed actress!
Pete? Pete?
Why don't we just go up?
No. No. Wait. No. No! Don't go up there!
Why not?
Because A, he might be one of them, and B, he might still be annoyed. Pete? Maybe he went into work.
Well, how come he didn't drive? His keys are still here.
Well, maybe he got a lift; he said he wasn't feeling very well. Pete?
OI, PRICK!
, :

He's not in.
, :

He's not in.
Shaun! How are you doing?
Surviving.
Well maybe one should do the other, and then do themselves.
Oh maybe you should do me, I'll only muck it up if I have to do myself.
You know, I don't think I've got it in me to shoot my flatmate, my mum, and my girlfriend all in the same night.
What makes you think I'd have taken you back?
Well... You don't want to die single do you?
That's it. I would like to be shot.
Besides, I've changed. I haven't had a fag since yesterday, I promise!
He hasn't!
Player two has entered the game.
Ed!

Ohh, for God's sake! He's got an arm off!
Oh, he sells a bit of weed every now and again, you know. You've sold puff.
Yeah. Once. At college. To you.
See? You don't need Liz to have a good time.
Oh, don't, man.
No! Go ahead, look at me. Can I just say one more thing? I'm not gonna say, you know, there's plenty more fish in the sea. I'm not going to say if you love her, let her go. And I'm not going to bombard you with clichés. But what I will say is this?
It's not the end of the world.
Got you these.
""To a wonderful mum""?
Oooh! Yeah, that's, because... I thought, it would be, funny, because of what you said last night about me y'know, don't wanna be my mum and that. It's just a little joke, just sort of spur of the moment...
They're for your mum, aren't they?
Yeah.
Smooth.
Philip, have you still got the child-locks on?
Safety first, Shaun.
You still haven't met his mum?
Not yet!
Don't you get on with your mum, Shaun?
It's not that I don't get on with her...
Are you ashamed by your mum, Shaun?
No! I love my mum!
I love his mum too.
Ed!
She's like butter!
Ed!
You left them in my flat.
Yeah, in the bin!
I was desperate.
Sneaky monkey...
Basically, I'd say your nine lives are up, Shaun
Get fucked, four eyes! Why don't you go out with her if you love her so much?
What do you mean by that?
Well, I don't know what he meant by that.
If you get cornered...
...bash 'em in the head, that seems to work. Ow.
Excuse me?
Excuse me?
Hellew?
Oi!
Oh, my God! She's so drunk!
No, Noel, no matter you might think, okay, I do not find it difficult to keep my work and my social life separate.
Shaun, it's Liz for you.
There!
Where?
Three o'clock!
Oh! Over there again. Quarter to twelve.
What?
Eleven forty-five!
Keep it simple!
Top left!
Who the hell put this on?
It's on random.
Mum, look, what would you say if I told you that over the years Philip's been quite unkind to me?
Well you weren't always the easiest person to live with.
Mum, he chased me around the garden with a bit of wood!
Well you did call him a you-know-what!
Oh what, did he tell you that?
Yes he did.
Motherfucker!
Shaun!
Sorry mother... mum!
Did you know that on several occasions... he touched me?
That wasn't true. Made it up. Shouldn't have done. Sorry.
Now, I'm not saying it was you.
I know, man...
I'm saying it was Ed.
Right.
Well... is it clear?
No.
How many?
Lots.
You're the one that's gone from being a chartered accountant to Charlton Heston!
I'm not a chartered accountant!
Well, you look like one!
YEAH!
I'm a lecturer.
You're a twat!
YEAH!
Ed, this is serious!
Shaun, what's going on?
Shit, it's engaged!
How about an ambulance?
It's engaged, Ed.
A fire engine?
It's one number, Ed, and it's busy! Okay? What you want a fire engine for, anyway?
Anything with flashing lights, you know?
Would anyone like... a peanut?
Two seconds!
Oi! What are you doing?
What am I doing? What are you doing, you stupid moron?
Fuck off!
You fuck off! Fuck fucking off! I've spent... look at me! I've spent my entire life sticking my neck out for you and all you ever do is fuck things up! Fuck things up and make me look stupid! Well, I'm not going to let you do it any more. OK? Not today!
Shaun!
What?
Oh.
All right, what about her, then?
Ooooooh... cockacidal maniac. Ex-porn star. She's done it all. They say she starred in the world's first interracial hardcore loop...
Café au lait...
... pour vous!
Why is Queen still playing?
Ah, we have a situation here.
I KNOW!
Now, as well as, er, Mr. Sloane being off today, I'm afraid Ash is, er, feeling a little bit, erm, under the weather. So I will be taking charge as the, erm...
...oldest...
...senior staff member.
SHAUN!
NO!
YES, yes, in the head!
AHHHHHHHHH!
They still out there?
Yeah. What you think we should do?
Have a sit down?
Whoa, mama!
Christ! What the hell do you think you're doing?
Chill out. Everyone's all right.
Stop telling me to chill out!
Oh! Hello! Who's a pretty boy, then?
You didn't tell me Barbara had a Jag. I've always wanted to drive one of those.
Yeah, well, it's Philip's, okay? He won't let anybody near it. Honestly, I put half a Mars bar in the glove box once and he chased me around the garden with a bit of wood.
Fuck. It's gorgeous.
You gonna thank me then?
For what?
Tidying up!
Doesn't look that tidy.
Well, I had a few beers when I finished.
All right, I've got a car outside, but it's going to be a bit cramped, so has anyone got transport?
Yes, yes!
Great, where?
Oh? No, well I passed my test.
I'm sorry, Shaun.
It's OK.
No, I'm *sorry*, Shaun.
What?
Oh, God, that's rotten!
I'll stop doing it when you stop laughing!
I am not laughing!
I gotta do a wee first.
He's not my Dad, he's my stepdad!
Who the hell put this on?
It's on random.
For fuck's sake!
Big Al says so.
Yeah, but Big Al says dogs can't look up!
There's a girl in the garden.
What?
In the garden, there is a girl.
Well, I mean, it's not that I don't like David and Di, you know.
Guys, it's not that I don't like you.
It's all right.
And I do want to spend time with you.
It's just Ed doesn't have too many friends...
This one comes with a basic sort of digital package, uh, you got your Lifestyle Channels there, a bit of ""Trisha,"" um, you got ""Entertainment"" - don't know what that is. News. All the basic, uh, news channels.
Don't point that gun at my mum!
Don't point that gun at Barbara!

Don't point that gun at my mum!
Don't point that gun at Barbara!
You've been to a lock-in.
Several.
You are not driving that car...
PHILIP! Give me the car keys...
You should do me. I'll muck it up if I have to do myself.
I don't think I've got it in me to shoot my flatmate, my mum and my girlfriend all in the same evening!
Hey! You're dead!"
John Winger,BI,Slacker,"Cut it out! Cut it out! Cut it out! The hell's the matter with you? Stupid! We're all very different people. We're not Watusi. We're not Spartans. We're Americans, with a capital 'A', huh? You know what that means? Do ya? That means that our forefathers were kicked out of every decent country in the world. We are the wretched refuse. We're the underdog. We're mutts! Here's proof: his nose is cold! But there's no animal that's more faithful, that's more loyal, more loveable than the mutt. Who saw ""Old Yeller?"" Who cried when Old Yeller got shot at the end?
Nobody cried when Old Yeller got shot? I'm sure.
I cried my eyes out. So we're all dogfaces, we're all very, very different, but there is one thing that we all have in common: we were all stupid enough to enlist in the Army. We're mutants. There's something wrong with us, something very, very wrong with us. Something seriously wrong with us - we're soldiers. But we're American soldiers! We've been kicking ass for 200 years! We're ten and one! Now we don't have to worry about whether or not we practiced. We don't have to worry about whether Captain Stillman wants to have us hung. All we have to do is to be the great American fighting soldier that is inside each one of us. Now do what I do, and say what I say. And make me proud.
Have you ever been convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor? That's robbery, rape, car theft, that sort of thing.
Convicted? No.
Never convicted.
C'mon, it's Czechoslovakia. We zip in, we pick 'em up, we zip right out again. We're not going to Moscow. It's Czechoslovakia. It's like going into Wisconsin.
Well I got the shit kicked out of me in Wisconsin once. Forget it!
You can't go! All the plants are gonna *die*!
Okay, Mr. Push-ups, let's hear your story.
Chicks dig me, because I rarely wear underwear and when I do it's usually something unusual. But now I know why I have always lost women to guys like you. I mean, it's not just the uniform. It's the stories that you tell. So much fun and imagination.
Lee Harvey, you are a madman. When you stole that cow, and your friend tried to make it with the cow. I want to party with you, cowboy. If the two of us together, forget it. I'm gonna go out on a limb here. I'm gonna volunteer my leadership to this platoon. An army without leaders is like a foot without a big toe. And Sergeant Hulka isn't always gonna be here to be that big toe for us. I think that we owe a big round of applause to our newest, bestest buddy, and big toe... Sergeant Hulka.
Well, okay, hot shot. We're gonna see what kind of soldier you are. Reveille is O five hundred. We're going to fall out with locker boxes and we're going to have a locker box inspection. And then we're going to do ten miles. Rain or shine! So, you better hit them bunks my little babies. Or, Sgt Hulka with the big toe is going to see how far he can stick it up your ass!
And then depression set in.
You could join a monastery.
Did you ever see a monk get wildly fucked by some teenage girls?
Never.
So much for the monastery.
Now, are either of you homosexuals?
You mean, like, flaming, or...
Well, it's a standard question we have to ask.
No, we're not homosexual, but we are *willing to learn*.
Yeah, would they send us someplace special?
I guess that's ""no"" on both. Now if you could just give Uncle Sam your autograph...
Where is your drill sergeant, men?
Blown up, sir!
Blown up, sir!
My philosophy: a hundred-dollar shine on a three-dollar pair of shoes.
John, do you think I'm officer material?
God, I'm worried about you.
Come on! I'm in good shape, I'm walking tall, I'm looking good. First weekend in Europe.
Yeah. We're spending it in an airplane hangar... guarding a truck!
We've got each other.
Tito Puente's gonna be dead, and you're gonna say, ""Oh, I've been listening to him for years, and I think he's fabulous.""
Are you telling me that you men finished your training on your own?
That's the fact, Jack.
That's the fact, Jack.
Men, welcome to the United States Army. I'm Sergeant Hulka. I'm your drill sergeant. Before we proceed any further, we gotta get something straight. Your mamas are not here to take care of you now. It's just you, me, and Uncle Sam. And before I leave you, you're gonna find out that me and Uncle Sam are one in the same.
Uncle Hulka?
Why'd the chicken cross the road?
To get from the left to the right
He stepped out of rank, got hit by a tank
He ain't no chicken no more
You know something soldier, I've noticed that you're always last.
I'm pacing myself, Sergeant.
Move it!
Come on. Let's take the truck.
Nooo.
Oh yeah.
Nooo.
Oh-ho, yeah.
No, no.
Oh-oh...
No.
...yeah, yeah...
No.
...yeah, yeah...
No.
...yeah, yeah.
No, John. No.
I'll drive.
Okay.
Oh, it's not the speed really so much, I just wish I hadn't drunk all that cough syrup this morning.
Where have you been soldier?
Training, sir.
Training, sir.
What kind of training?
Army training, sir.
Army training, sir.
I've never gone this way before.
Well, I'm sure there's a lot of ways I've gone that you haven't.
I don't think I've ever been this happy.
We got a full day ahead of us. We're gonna start out with a five-mile run.
I know that I'm speaking for the entire platoon when I say this run should be postponed until this platoon is better rested.
Well, I'll tell you what, soldier. Let's make it ten miles.
You don't say ""sir"" to me, I'm a sergeant, I work for a living.
Yes, sergeant!
I didn't hear you!
*Yes, sergeant*!
*That's* what I wanna hear.
Do you think this guy's over-doing it a bit?
I'm talking about something important, like discipline and duty and honor and courage. And you ain't got none of it!
Those words mean so much to a man who scrubs garbage cans. Look, if you don't want me in your Army, kick me out, but get off my back.
Maybe you'd like to take a swing at me.
I 'd like to take a BIG swing at you, sarge.
Well, go ahead and give it your best shot.
I don't think I want to go to the stockade.
I'll take my hat off. There we are, Winger. Ain't no more drill sergeant. It's just you and me, kid, man to man. So go ahead, give it your best shot. Swing at me. Gutless. Punk!
I'm willing to forget this little incident. And I want you to think real hard about it. And maybe someday you'll understand what the hell I'm talking about.
Where do you think you're going? Are you going AWOL? Are you going AWOL?
No, I'm deserting.
You idiot! You desert now, it's a federal offense!
I'll take my chances with the feds!
You're not going anywhere!
You listen to me! You're gonna finish basic training! You're gonna keep your mouth shut, and you're gonna do everything he tells you! You know why?
Why?
Because you talked me into this, you idiot! It was your idea!
I didn't talk you into this. You NEEDED this.
I'm gonna kill you, damn you! Where's the great pay? Where's the travel? Where's the Winnebago, Goddamnit!
Oh, my balls! OH, MY BALLS!
Don't order the Schnitzel, they're using Schnauzer.
I've had an interesting morning. In the last two hours I've lost my job, my apartment, my car, and my girlfriend.
You still have your health.
We're so damned lost. Where the hell is Innsbruck, Austria?
Now, since nobody else has got the guts...
...to admit it, the rest of this platoon... will do the next two weekends on KP.
How's that sound to you, mister?
I think it sucks.
You know who would love this? Russell!
, :
Russell! Russell! Help us!
, :
Russell! Russell! Help us!
Thaaaank yoooou!
It doesn't seem fair.
FAIR? Who cares about fair? The world isn't fair. Truth is fair. Is it fair that you were born like this? NO! They're not expecting somebody like you in there, Ox. They're expected one of these slugs. You're different. You're weird. You're a mutant. You're a killer. You're a trained killer. You're a LEAN... MEAN...

I'LL DO IT!
Boxer or Jockey?
You got something in a low-rise bikini? Mesh, if possible.
I'm Captain Hollister, Special Operations Group. Who are you?
I'm Major Dodge.
Captain DeSoto.
Pleasure to meet you, Hollister. Heard a lot about you.
Well, I never heard any of you. And you're not on my roster.
That's just the way we like to keep it, Captain. It's double double top-secret.
Intelligence?
Some.
Intelligence?
John Winger: Some
Well, that was interesting.
. That's not what I heard.
Who said that?
Pick that up! Who said that!
Was it you?
I said it.
Now, I don't care what you heard. My sources told me that Sgt. Crocker was in guilt of the accident and unable to control his men!
Have it your way... sir.
You bet I will, soldier. Now, I don't want to hear one more insubordinate word from anyone in this platoon. The subject is closed. You better stop worrying about what happened to Sgt. Hulka and start worrying about how you're all going to pass graduation, tomorrow. You have three days to get it together and if you want my honest opinion
You're not going to make it.
There are two things I promised myself I'd never do: Kill and die.
What if the Russians were raping your sister?
Come on, you know my sister. You practically raped her one night. The Russians would just have to buy her dinner.
Hello? Hello?
Hello?
Hello.
Who is it?
It's Idi Amin.
It's Winger!
Do the words ""act of war"" mean anything to you?
I have... a plan.
Great! Custer had a plan, too.
How much can you straighten out in one week?
It hasn't been a week, John. It's been six months! Nothing's changed! You sleep until noon and then you watch ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" and then you drive your... , what, a couple of hours? You come home and you order out food and then you play those stupid Tito Puente albums until two in the morning!
Tito Puente is going to be dead and you're going to say, ""Oh, I've been listening to him for years and I think he's fabulous.""
That's right. And then you watch movies until dawn and then - then you come to bed with me.
You don't think that takes energy? You're a sexual dynamo! Most guys couldn't even handle you. I've been readin' books on the outside just so I can keep up with you!
It's not funny. You're going nowhere, John. It's just not that cute anymore.
It's a little cute. Come on, I'm part of a lost and restless generation. What do you want me to do? Run for the Senate?
John, no. It's not going to work! Look, I like you; but, I need something more. I need somebody whose going to develop with me and somebody whose going to grow with me. Goodbye.
Grow?
Bye.
Who can grow more than me? Talk about massive potential for growth! I am the little acorn that becomes the oak!
This doesn't look bad.
What? The Army? You're kidding.
No. I've always thought about joining the Army.
Bull shit, you're not the type.
What do you mean I'm not the type? I've seen the kind of guys that enlist in the Army. I saw them when I was working in unemployment. They're just like us, except they're not as - sophisticated.
Yeah, they're not as old either.
You're all in this together!
One of these men may save your life one of these days. You understand that?
Then again, maybe one of us won't.
This might be fun.
You know what the rest of your problem is?
Tell me.
You've never had anybody give you the Aunt Jemima treatment.
Who's your friend? Who's your buddy? I am, aren't I? You're crazy about me, aren't you?
Have you been doing your special exercises?
I brought the magic suitcase."
Aram Finklestein,BI,Slacker,"So, you like Mom. Are you two gonna date now?
I don't know.
You don't really know anything, do ya? I mean, she's kinda your girlfriend.
Are you gonna be our new dad?
And, if so, who'll be our nanny?
Yeah, and what'll we call you?
Jesus, I'm not being nominated to Supreme Court here, guys. I just had sex with your mother.
And when I say sex... I mean that I gave her... a nice massage.
With sperm.
Aram, I know you took some women's studies courses in college, but other than that, do you have any kind of experience that you think might've prepared you for this job?
Uhh... I used to buy tampons for my mother.
YOU... will fit in perfectly.
Aram! Aram!
Mom is dead!
What?
Come on!
She's not dead.
Could be post-mortem twitch.
Someone like you shouldn't be with someone like me - an old girlfriend with two kids.
You're an ageist.
Oh, such a smart girl.
But she never graduated college, and you hated her.
But the French. She spoke it so beautifully.
She was from there.
So, what does his future hold, Rabbi?
Mom, he's not a palm reader.
I thought I'd met my soul mate.
You met a really hot French girl who needed a green card.
She was just so...
Hot!
It wasn't that.
Sexy.
It was something else. She needed me.
Yes, to get a green card.
So does that mean you and Mom are gonna have a baby?
Nooo.
I don't get it. You said that spurn makes a baby.
""Sperm,"" and it does. You know, can we stop talking about this please, okay? I like your mother, and I think she likes me, and that's all that's important.
And you also work for her.
Sing me a song or I'll throw up on you.
When you put it that way...
You said it yourself. You don't wanna just coast - you know, just coast along - but, w... but this isn't coasting. This is... this-s-s-s is ROLLER coasting.
What do you think about kids?
I think about makin' 'em all the time.
Aram, I know you took some women's studies course in college. But other than that, do you have any kind of experience that you think might have prepared you for this job?
Uh... I used to by tampons for my mother.
You will fit in perfectly.
Yes."
Clayton,AE,Egomaniac Hunter,"Go ahead. Shoot me.
Be a man.
Not a man like you!
Oh, my goodness! Daddy, I was walking. There was... was a little baby, little baby monkey, and I drew a picture!
Yes, go on.
Suddenly, the monkey starts crying.
Oh, poor thing.
But, I turn around and there's a whole FLEET OF THEM. An ARMY of monkeys! A huge tree full of monkeys, screaming at me!
That's theropithecus baboonus! She's very good at this!
Terrified! I was terrified! Suddenly, I was swinging, on a vine, in the air! Swinging, in the air!
With the monkeys!
I was in the air! And then, I was all surrounded!
What did you do?
And, Daddy! They took my boot!
Your boot - those are the ones I bought you.
And I was SAVED. I was saved by a flying, wild man in a loincloth.
Loincloth? Good Lord.
What is she talking about?
I haven't the foggiest idea. Takes after her mother, you know. She came up with stories like that. Not about men in loincloths, of course.
Gorilla.
Gor-illa.
Oh! Oh! He's got it!
Gor-illa!
Gorrrrr-illllla!
Oh, perhaps not...
Looks like a man but walks like an ape. He could be the missing link!
Or our link to the gorillas.
Even if you hadn't grown up a savage, you'd be lost. There are no trails through a woman's heart.
Hiding, are we? Good! I could use a challenge, because after hunting you, gathering up your little ape family will be all too easy!
Have we met?
And there were gorillas.
, :
Gorillas?
, :
Gorillas?
You found the gorillas? Where, Jane? Where?
He left with them.
Who did? Who?
Tarzan.
Tarzan?
The ape man.
If I can teach a parrot to sing ""God Save the Queen,"" I can certainly teach this savage a thing or two.
Sorry for the rude welcome, but I couldn't have you making a scene when we put your furry friends in their cages.
Why?
Why? For 300 pounds sterling a head. Actually, I have you to thank, old boy. Couldn't have done it without you.
Mr. Clayton, please. What if it's a gorilla?
It's no gorilla.
The point is, think about what we could learn from him. We must find him.
Professor! You're here to find gorillas. Not indulge some girlish fantasy!
Fantasy? I didn't imagine him! Tarzan is...
Real.
Ah, yes. I remember you. I think this one would be better off stuffed."
Charles Muntz,AE,Egomaniac Hunter,"Adventure is out there!
You know, Carl... these people who pass through here, they all tell pretty good stories.
A ""surveyor"" making a map.
A ""botanist"" cataloguing plants.
An old man taking his house to Paradise Falls.
That's the best one yet. I can't wait to hear how it ends.
Any last words Fredricksen? Come on, spit it out!
Does anyone know WHERE THEY ARE?
Master, dinner is ready.
Oh, yes, broken collar? It's that loose wire again.
There you go, big fella.
Thank you, Master.
I liked his other voice better.
The organization strips Muntz of his membership.
Humiliated, Muntz vows a return to Paradise Falls and promises to capture the beast alive!
I promise to capture the beast alive, and I will not come back until I do!
You lost them?
They were no match, too fast, they outsmarted us.
Yeah, Dug helped them get away.
Wait a minute, Dug?
Oh boy, my Pack isn't following us. Boy are they dumb.
Gray leader? Take down the house.
AAAAh!
Oh?
Gray Leader, checking in.
Gray Two, checking in.
Gray Three, checking in.
Target sighted."
John Wilson,AE,Egomaniac Hunter,"I would like to tell you a little story.
Oh, I love stories.
Well, you mustn't interrupt now, because you're way too beautiful to interrupt people. When I was in London in the early 40's, I was dining one evening at the Savoy with a rather select group of people, and sitting next to me was a very beautiful lady, much like yourself.
Now you're pulling my leg.
Now, just listen, dear. Well, we were dining and the bombs were falling, and we were all talking about Hitler and comparing him with Napoleon, and we were all being really brilliant. And then, suddenly, this beautiful lady, she spoke up and said that was the thing she didn't mind about Hitler, was the way he was treating the Jews. Well, we all started arguing with her, of course. Though, mind you, no one at the table was Jewish. But she persisted. Are you listening, honey?
Mustn't interrupt Daddy.
That's right. You're way too beautiful for that. Anyway, she went on to say that that's how she felt about it, that if she had her way, she would kill them all, burn them in ovens, like Hitler. Well, we all sat there in silence. Then finally, I leaned over to her and I said, ""Madam, I have dined with some of the ugliest goddamn bitches in my time. And I have dined with some of the goddamndest ugly bitches in this world. But you, my dear, are the ugliest bitch of them all."" Well, anyway, she got up to leave and she tripped over a chair and fell on the floor. And we all just sat there. No one raised a hand to help her. And finally when she picked herself up I said to her one more time: ""You, my dear, are the ugliest goddamn bitch I have ever dined with."" Well, you know what happened? The very next day, she reported me to the American Embassy. And they brought me in for reprimand. And then when they investigated it, they found out she was a German agent. And they locked her up.
Isn't that amazing?
Why did you tell me that story?
Oh, I don't know. It wasn't because I thought you were a German agent, honey. But I was tempted tonight to say the very same thing to you. I didn't want you to think I had never said it before. You, madam, are the - Well, you know the rest.
How 'bout that. I feel pretty good, really. It's like I always tell ya kid, you gotta fight when you think it's the right thing to do. Otherwise, you feel like your gut's full of puss. Even if you get the hell beat outta ya, if ya fight, ya feel ok about it.
No Hollywood safaris for me.
That word has crept into the conversation quite a few times, hasn't it?
Which word is that, sir?
Hollywood. I realize it's the name of a place, but the way you say it has an added meaning. Like an insult.
Well, l didn't mean it like that.
Don't contradict me, Ralph. I've heard it all before. In the Army, in New York in the theater. Hell, l've heard it everywhere. People say Hollywood when they want to insult you. Well, really Hollywood is just a place where they make a profit. It's a factory town like Detroit or Birmingham or Schaffhausen. Because the cheap element of the town has been so overly advertised it becomes an insult to remind a man he's from there. They're not talking about the people who work there and that try to do something worthwhile. They're talking about the whores when they mention Hollywood. You know what that word means, don't you, Ralph?
Sure.
Sure. Whores have to sell the one thing that shouldn't be for sale in the world. And that's love. Of course, there are other kinds of whores than the floozies you frequent. There are whores who sell words and ideas and melodies. I know what l'm talking about because l've done a little hustling in my time. A hell of a lot more than l'd like to admit to. And what l sold when l was whoring l'll never get back. What l'm trying to say, it's the whores who put Hollywood up as a big target. Sure.
Wake me up if we crash into the mountain. I wouldn't want to miss that.

Victor Quartermaine,AE,Egomaniac Hunter,"I want...
... toupée, please.
Oh, grand. We take cheques or cash.
Toupée, you idiot! My hair is in your machine.
Oh, no, it's only rabbits in there. The hare, I think you'll find, is a much larger mammal.
To kill such a creature will require nerves of steel and... a bullet!
A bullet?
A bullet!
A bull...
Oh!
What kind of bullet?
A bullet... of pure gold.
Gold?
Yes... 24 ""carrots""
How on earth would those tiny-minded buffoons ever catch such a big rabbit?
Mr. Wallace?
Um... with a big trap!
By Jove, he... he's got it!
I'm sorry my dear but I refuse to suffer any more humiliation at the hands of these blundering nittwits. I therefore bid you good day.
I don't want to alarm anyone, but the beast isn't actually dead yet.
*The beast isn't actually dead yet?*
Oops.
I know your little secret, Pesto. I know exactly what's going on.
Your Lordship...
Oh, yes. You think you can pilfer my filly, don't you? You think you can con an innocent woman out of her fortune?
Who, me?
Well, I got here first! I've spent a long time reeling in that fluffy-headed bunny-lover, and I'm not about to let some puddle-headed peasant poach her from me. Comprenez?
No nonsense with Victor Quartermaine. What you see is what you get.
Spare me the sermon, vicar! Just tell me how I can kill him!... I mean, it.
Your loyalty's moving. Sadly, you won't be.
But Victor, didn't we agree, no more thoughtless killing?
Quite right, my dear, so I thought this one out very carefully.
It's off to bunny heaven for you, big ears!
What ho! Heard you had a spot of rabbit bother.
No one beats Victor Quartermain!
Is that so?
Consider yourself dumped.
Aarrghh! Potty poo!
This buck stops here!
If I can't have your money, I'll can still bag your Bunny!
You see, Victor, there is hope for the vegetables yet.
Not the ones I'm looking at.
Vicar! Vicar! Oh, where the devil is he?
Do you want to confess?
I want to talk to you about... The beast.
Everything you need to know is inside this book.

Keep your arms above the surface. When the kid comes back, grab on.
Indy, he...
He's a good kid, Marion. You should get off his back about school.
Mutt, I mean...
Not everybody is cut out for it.
His name is Henry!
Henry. Good name.
He's your son.
My son?
Henry Jones the III.
Why the hell didn't you make him finish school?
Damn, I thought that was closer...
Dance on your own time, will you?
Whoa.
Whoa.
WHOA!
You're lucky I turned up, Jonesey. Dovchenko there wanted to blow your brains out. That's the third time I saved your life.
Unshackle me. I'll give you a big hug.
You're a teacher?
Part-time.
Where'd they go? Space?
Not into space. Into the space between spaces.
You know, for an old man you ain't bad in a fight.

You want to be a good archaeologist...

Mom!
Sweetheart! What in the world are you doing here?
Mom?
Ah, don't worry about me. Are you alright?
Marion is your...
Young man, I specifically told you...
...your mother?
... not to come down here.
Marion Ravenwood is your mother?
I should've known Jones would drag you into this.
Marion Ravenwood is your mother?
For cryin' out loud, Jones, is it so hard to figure out?
So, Dr. Jones, you will help us?
A simple ""yes"" will do.
Oh, Marion, you had to go and get yourself kidnapped.
Not like you did any better.
Same old, same old.
One of the scorpions just stung me! Am I gonna die?
How big?
Huge!
Good.
Good?
When it comes to scorpions, the bigger the better. Small one bites you, don't keep it to yourself.
Grab on. It's a rat snake!
Rat snakes aren't that big.
Well, this one is, all right? It's not even poisonous. Now grab on!
Go get something else.
Like what?
Like a rope or something.
There's no Sears and Roebuck here! Grab the snake!
Maybe I can touch the bottom.
There's no bottom. Now grab it.
I think I can feel it with my feet
Grab the snake!
Stop calling it that!
It's a snake! What do you want me to call it?
Say ""rope.""
What?
Say ""Grab the rope""!

Grab the rope!

No! No, he was Britsh! My dad was an RAF Pilot; he was a war hero; not some school teacher!
No, sweetheart! Collin was your step father. We started dating 3 months after you were born! He was a good man!
Wait... wait... wait a minute! Collin? As in Collin Williams? Ha! You, you married him? I introduced you!
I think you gave up your vote on who I married, when you decided to break it off a week before the wedding!
You and I both knew Marion, that it wasn't gonna work out!
Then why didn't you ever talk to me about it?
Because, we never had an argument I won!
Oh, for the love of God! Shut the hell up!
Didn't you ever wonder why Ox stopped writing, he hated that you walked out on me!
Would you two just stop!
Yeah, Marion! Let's not let the kid see mom and dad fight!
You're not my dad, alright!
You bet I am; and I've got news for you; you're gonna go back and finish school!
Oh really! What happend to there's not a damn thing wrong, with you kid, don't let anybody ealse tell you any different! You don't remember saying that!
That was before I was your father!
You're not my father!
Oh yes, he is your father!
You should've told me about the kid, Marion; I had a right to know!
You vanished, after that!
I wrote!
A year later! By then, Mutt was born, and I was married!
Why in the bother did you tell me now?
Because I thought we were gonna die!
Not yet!
Got it?
Oh shit!
I'm sure I wasn't the only one moving on with my life, there must have been plenty of women for you over the years.
There were a few. But they all had the same problem.
Oh yeah, what's that?
They weren't you, honey.
Oh, that can't be good.
All personnel, it is now one minute to zero time. Put on goggles or turn away. Do not remove goggles or face burst until ten seconds after first light.
That can't be good at all.
Indy, thank God. Don't you know it's dangerous to climb into a refrigerator? Those things can be deathtraps!
Good to see you too, Bob.

Good thing we're not grave robbers.
This warehouse is where you and your government have hidden all of your secrets, yes?
This is a military warehouse. I've never been here before in my life.
So what are you, a triple agent?
Nah, I just lied about being a double.
Leave it to Ox to write a riddle in a dead language.
I've got a bad feeling about this.
You still living a trail of human wreckage, or have you retired?
Why? You looking for a date?
With anyone but you.
You can get us into that building, yes?
Drop dead.
I'm sorry. I meant drop dead, comrade.
How fortunate our failure to kill you, Dr. Jones. You survive to be of service to us once again.
Well, you know me, always glad to help.
Nazca Indians used to bind their infants' head with rope to elongate the skull like that.
Why?
Honor the gods.
No, no. God's head is not like that, man.
Depends on who your god is.
Mom!
Honey!
Slow down!
Honey! Stop, we're gonna go the cliff!
That's the idea!
Bad idea; give me the wheel!
Trust me!

Don't ever do that again!
Yes, dear!
Three times it drops! The way down...
Reverse! Put it in reverse! Reverse! Reverse!

Three times it drops?
Three times it drops!

Oh, what does he mean?
He means one... two...
... Three!

Marion! Marion!
Through eyes at last I saw in tears...
...the golden vision reapears! Through eyes... through eyes in tears! We gotta go through that waterfall!
The skull has to be returned! I'll do it! No one else has to come!
Who cares! It's brought us nothing but trouble!
Look what it did to him!
I have to return it!
Why you?
Because it told me to!
I took Spanish. I didn't understand a word of that. What was it?
Quechua, local Incan dialect.
Where'd you learn that one?
Long story.
I got time.
I rode with Pancho Villa. A couple of his guys spoke it.
Bullshit!
You asked.
I don't understand. Why the legend about the city of gold?
The Ugha word for gold translates as ""treasure."" But their treasure wasn't gold. It was knowledge. Knowledge was their treasure.
Marion, take the wheel.
That's not fair. She drove the truck.
Don't be a child. Find something to fight with.
Name's Mutt, Mutt Williams.
Mutt?
Yeah.
What kind of name is that?
It's the one I picked. You got a problem with it?
Take it easy.
Nice try kid, but it looks like you brought a knife...
... to a gun fight.
What's your mom's name again?
Mary. Mary Williams. You remember her?
There've been a lot of Marys, kid.
Shut up! That's my mother you're talking about! All right? That's my mother.
You don't have to get sore all the time just to prove how tough you are.
What's he gonna do now?
I don't think he plans that far ahead.
Yeah.
Scooch over, will you, Son?
Don't call me ""son."" Don't.
I think I'd cover my ears if I were you.
Duck! Duck!
Professor, this really is a dead end. Look.
Come on, genius.
Well done, Henry!
, :
Thanks, Ox.
, :
Thanks, Ox.
I'm sure I wasn't the only person to go on with my life. There must have been plenty of women for you over the years.
Yeah. There were a few, but they all had the same problem.
Yeah? What's that?
They weren't you, honey.


Belief, Dr. Jones, is a gift you have yet to receive. My sympathies.
Oh, I believe, sister. That's why I'm down here.
You broke my nose!
I told you.
Enough! You will speak to Oxley and lead us to Akator, yes?
Nyet.
Take him outside.
Don't toy with me, Dr. Jones. What is the point of all this?
If it's still magnetic, the metal in this gun powder should point the way.
Unbelievable.
Oxley, don't just sit there. For God's sake, man. Go get help!
Help?
Help!
Help?
Good work, Ox. Thanks.
Help.
Be careful, you may get exactly what you wish for.
I usually do.
We were younger.
I still am young!
We had guns. Put your hands down, will you? You're embarrassing us.
Bet you 500 bucks we get out of this.
Let's call it 100.
How did Deidra take the news?
How does any wife take such things? The look on her face is a combination of pride and panic.
I think I understand, Ox. Someone came?
What the hell is that?
A portal! A pathway to another dimension!
I don't think we want to go that way.
You're not from around here, are you?
Where is it you would imagine I am from, Dr. Jones?
Well, the way you're sinking your teeth into those wubble-u's, I should think maybe Eastern Ukraine.
Compass! I need a compass! You know, north, south, east...
West.
No compass?
I need your bullets!
HaHa! On zhelayet moih patrone!
The contents of that box are highly magnitized. I need gun powder. You want my help or not?
""The water sleeps until the great snake."" These aren't just drawings, they're directions. Get me a map!
Karta!
No defiant last words, Dr. Jones?
I like Ike.
Put down gun.
You got it, pal.
What exactly am I being accused of other than surviving a nuclear explosion?
This is incredible.
Unreal.
Crystal's not magnetic.
Neither is gold.
What are they? Spacemen?
Interdimensional beings, in point of fact.
Welcome back, Ox.
Clearly I have chosen the wrong pressure point. Perhaps I can find a more sensitive one.
Prinesite yom!
Get your hands off me, you rotten Russki son of a bitch!
Indiana Jones.
About time you showed up.
Mom!
Sweetheart.
""Mom""?
Oxley? Ox, it's me, Indy. Ox? Ox, you're faking it, right?
""Through eyes that last I saw in tears...""
Ox, listen to me, pal. Your name is Harold Oxley. You were born in Leeds, England. You and I went to school together at the University of Chicago. And you were never *this* interesting.
You're not the man I knew ten years ago.
It's not the years, honey, it's the mileage.
Meet me at Omar's. Be ready for me. I'm going after that truck.
How?
I don't know, I'm making this up as I go!
Do we need the monkey?
I'm surprised at you. Talking that way about our baby. He's got your looks, too.
And your brains.
Yes she does! She's very smart.
You want to talk to God? Let's go see him together, I've got nothing better to do.
What a fitting end to your life's pursuits. You're about to become a permanent addition to this archaeological find. Who knows? In a thousand years, even you may be worth something.
Ha ha ha ha.
Son of a bitch.
There's a big snake in the plane, Jock!
Oh, that's just my pet snake Reggie.
I hate snakes, Jock! I hate 'em!
Come on! Show a little backbone, will ya!
Indy, why does the floor move?
Give me your torch.
Snakes. Why'd it have to be snakes?
Asps... very dangerous. You go first.
Marion's the least of your worries right now, believe me, Indy.
What do you mean?
Well, I mean that for nearly three thousand years man has been searching for the lost ark. It's not something to be taken lightly. No one knows its secrets. It's like nothing you've ever gone after before.
Oh, Marcus. What are you trying to do, scare me? You sound like my mother. We've known each other for a long time. I don't believe in magic, a lot of superstitious hocus pocus. I'm going after a find of incredible historical significance, you're talking about the boogie man. Besides, you know what a cautious fellow I am.
I can only say I'm sorry so many times.
Well, say it again anyway!
Sorry.
We have top men working on it right now.
Who?
Top... men.
Whiskey
How odd that it should end this way for us after so many stimulating encounters. I almost regret it. Where shall I find a new adversary so close to my own level?
Try the local sewer.
Give me the whip.
Throw me the idol.
No time to argue! Throw me idol, I'll throw you the whip!
Give me the whip!
Adiós, señor.
The Ark of the Covenant, the chest that the Hebrews used to carry around the Ten Commandments.
What, you mean THE Ten Commandments?
Yes, the actual Ten Commandments, the original stone tablets that Moses brought down from Mt. Horeb and smashed, if you believe in that sort of thing...
Didn't any of you guys ever go to Sunday school?
Indy, there is something that troubles me.
What is it?
The Ark. If it is there, at Tanis, then it is something that man was not meant to disturb. Death has always surrounded it. It is not of this earth.
He said you were a bum.
Aw, he's being generous.
The most gifted bum he ever trained. You know, he loved you like a son... took a hell of a lot for you to alienate him.
Not much... just you.
Marion, don't look at it. Shut your eyes, Marion. Don't look at it, no matter what happens!
Here, take this,
Wave it at anything that slithers.
The whole place is slitherin'!
Indy!

You and I are very much alike. Archeology is our religion, yet we have both fallen from the pure faith. Our methods have not differed as much as you pretend. I am but a shadowy reflection of you. It would take only a nudge to make you like me. To push you out of the light.
Now you're getting nasty.
Hello, Marion.
Indiana Jones. I always knew some day you'd come walking back through my door. I never doubted that. Something made it inevitable. So, what are you doing here in Nepal?
I need one of the pieces your father collected.
I've learned to hate you in the last ten years!
I never meant to hurt you.
I was a child. I was in love. It was wrong and you knew it!
You knew what you were doing.
Now I do. This is my place. Get out!
Belloq.
Good afternoon, Doctor Jones.
I oughta kill you right now.
Not a very private place for a murder.
Let us hurry. There is nothing to fear here.
That's what scares me.
Well, Jones, at least you haven't forgotten how to show a lady a good time.
Boy, you're something!
Yeah? I'll tell you what: until I get back my five thousand dollars, you're gonna get more than you bargained for. I'm your goddamn partner!
Indy, you have no time. If you still want the ark, it is being loaded onto a truck for Cairo.
Truck? What truck?
Where'd you get that?
From him.
Who 'him'?
Katanga. I got a feeling I'm not the first woman to travel with these pirates.
Stay here.
If you insist, señor.
However, an Egyptian pharaoh...
Shishak.
...yes, invaded the city of Jerusalem round about 980 B.C., and he may have take the Ark back to the city of Tanis and hidden it in a secret chamber called The Well of Souls.
Secret chamber?
However, about a year after the pharaoh had returned to Egypt, the city of Tanis was consumed by the desert in a sand storm which lasted a whole year. Wiped clean by the wrath of God.
Uh... huh.
Obviously, we've come to the right men. Now you seem to know, uh, all about this Tanis, then.
No, no, not really. Ravenwood is the real expert. Abner did the first serious work on Tanis. Collected some of its relics. It was his obsession, really. But he never found the city.
Frankly, we're somewhat suspicious of Mr. Ravenwood, an American being mentioned so prominently in a secret Nazi cable.
Oh, rubbish. Ravenwood's no Nazi.
Well, what do the Nazis want him for then?
Well, obviously, the Nazis are looking for the headpiece to Staff of Ra and they think Abner's got it.
What exactly is a headpiece to the Staff of Ra?
Well, the staff is just a stick. I don't know, about this big. Nobody really knows for sure how high. And it's...
it's, uh... it's capped with an elaborate headpiece in the shape of the sun with a crystal in the center. And what you did was, you take the staff to a special room in Tanis, a map room with a miniature of the city all laid out on the floor. And if you put the staff in a certain place at a certain time of day, the sun shone through here and made beam that came down on the floor here... and gave you the exact location of the Well of the Souls.
Where the Ark of the Covenant was kept, right?.
That's exactly what the Nazis are looking for.
Now what does this Ark look like?
Uh... there's a picture of it right here.
That's it.
Good God!
Yes, that's just what the Hebrews thought.
Uh, now what's that supposed to be coming out of there?
Lightning. Fire. Power of God or something.
I'm beginning to understand Hitler's interest in this.
Oh, yes. The Bible speaks of the Ark leveling mountains and laying waste to entire regions. An army which carries the Ark before it... is invincible.
Now, what's that supposed to be coming out of there?
Lightning. Fire. The power of God or something.
I'm beginning to understand Hitler's interest in this.
Too bad the Hovitos don't know you the way I do, Belloq.
Yes, too bad. You could warn them... if only you spoke Hovitos!
Balloq's medallion only had writing on one side? You sure about that?
Positive!
Balloq's staff is too long.
, :
They're digging in the wrong place!
, :
They're digging in the wrong place!
Adios, Satipo...
Doctor Jones, we've heard a lot about you.
Have you?
Professor of Archeology, expert on the occult, and how does one say it... obtainer of rare antiquities.
That's one way of saying it. Why don't you sit down, you'll be more comfortable.
Yes, you're a man of many talents.
Now, you studied under Professor Ravenwood at the University of Chicago.
Yes, I did.
You have no idea of his present whereabouts?
Only rumors, really. Somewhere in Asia, I think. I haven't really spoken to him in ten years. We were friends once, but we had a bit of a falling out, I'm afraid.
Now, Doctor Jones, you must understand that this is all completely confidential.
I understand.
Yesterday afternoon, our European section intercepted a German communique that was sent from Cairo to Berlin.
You see, for the last two years, the Nazis have had teams of archaeologists running around the world looking for all sorts of religious artifacts. Hitler's a nut on the subject. He's crazy. He's obsessed with the occult. And right now, apparently, there is some kind of German archaeological dig going on in the desert outside Cairo.
Now, we have some information here, but we can't make anything out of it and maybe you can. ""Tanis development proceeding. Acquire headpiece, Staff of Ra, Abner Ravenwood, US.""
The Nazis have discovered Tanis!
Now just what does that mean to you... 'Tanis'?
Tanis is one of the possible resting places of the Lost Ark.
The Lost Ark?
Yeah, the Ark of the Covenant. The chest the Hebrews used to carry the Ten Commandments around in.
Alright now, what do you mean the Ten Commandments, you're talking about THE Ten Commandments?
Yes, the actual Ten Commandments. The original stone tablets that Moses brought down out of Mount Horeb and smashed, if you believe in that sort of thing. Didn't you guys ever go to Sunday School? Look, the Hebrews took the broken pieces and put them into the Ark. When they settled in Canaan, they put the Ark in a place called The Temple of Solomon, where it stayed for many years, till all of a sudden... whoosh, it was gone.
Where?
Nobody knows where or when.
This site also demonstrates one of the great dangers of archaeology; not to life and limb, although that does sometimes take place. I'm talking about folklore.
I'm gonna blow up the Ark, Rene.
Your persistence surprises even me. You're going to give mercenaries a bad name.
Hey, what happened? You don't look very happy.
Fools. Bureaucratic fools!
What'd they say?
They don't know what they've got there.
Well, I know what I've got here. Come on. I'll buy you a drink. You know, a drink?
This is it... This is where Forrestal cashed in.
A friend of yours?
A competitor... he was good. He was very good.
This were the old way, this says ""six Kadan height - ""
About seventy-two inches.
Wait!
""And take back one Kadan, to honor the Hebrew God whose ark this is.""
Doctor Jones, surely you don't think you can escape from this island?
That depends on how reasonable we're all willing to be. All I want is the girl.
And if we refuse?
Then your Führer has no prize.
I knew the Germans had hired you, Sallah. You're the best digger in Egypt.
My services are entirely inconsequential to them. They hired or shanghaied every digger in Cairo. The excavation is enormous. They hire only strong backs and they pay pennies for them. It's as if the pharaohs have returned.
Wow! Holy Smoke! Crash landing!
Short Round, step on it.
Okey dokey, Dr. Jones.
Hold on to your potatoes!
For crying out loud, there's a *kid* driving the car!
Relax, I've been giving him lessons.
Willie, Willie, Willie. What kind of a name is that? Is it short for something?
Willie is my professional name, Indiana.
Hey, lady! You call him Dr. Jones!
*My* professional name.
Wear your jewels to bed Princess?
Yeah... and nothing else. Shock you?
Nothing shocks me. I'm a scientist.
Oh, shit.
Mola Ram! Prepare to meet Kali... in Hell!
Willie, we-are-going-to-DIE!
Are you trying to develop a sense of humor or am I going deaf?
You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!
Maybe. But not today.
Shorty!
Hang on lady, we going for a ride!
Oh... my... God! Oh my God... Oh my God...
Is he nuts?
He no nuts, he's crazy!
What is Sankara?
Fortune and glory, kid. Fortune and glory.
I hate the water... and I hate being wet... and I hate YOU!
GOOD!
Kali Ma protects us! We are her children! We pledge our devotion to her with an offering of flesh... and blood!
Where's the antidote?
Oh, listen, I just met you! Oh, I'm not that kind of girl...
Hey, Dr. Jones, no time for love. We've got company.
Dr Jones, wasn't it the Sultan of Madagascar who threatened to cut off your head if you ever returned to his country?
No, it wasn't my head.
Then your hands, perhaps?
No, it wasn't my hands. It was my...
My misunderstanding.
What a vivid imagination.
""Palace slave""...
""Nocturnal activities""...
*I'm* a conceited ape?
""I'll tell you in the morning""...
I can't believe this.
He's not coming.
She's not coming.
I can't believe I'm not going.
You know how to fly, don't you?
Um, no. Do you?
Now you see the power of the rock you bring back.
Yes. I understand its power now.
Wait! WAIT! He's mine!
I'm all right kid.
There are two dead people in here!
There's gonna be two dead people in here! Hurry!
It's okay, kid. It's me.
What's that?
Antidote.
To what?
The poison you just drank.
Captain Blumburtt was just telling me something of the interesting history of the palace; the importance it played in the mutiny.
It seems the British never forget the mutiny of 1857.
Yes, well you know I think there were other events before the mutiny going back a century - back to the time of Clive that are more interesting.
And what events are those Dr Jones?
Well, if memory serves me correctly this area, this province was the centre eventuity of the Thuggee.
Dr Jones, you know perfectly well that the Thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a century.
Yes, of course. The Thuggee was an obscenity that worshipped Kali with human sacrifices. The British Army Knights did away with them.
Well, I suppose stories of the Thuggee die hard.
There are no stories anymore.
I'm not so sure. We came from a small village; peasants there told us Pankot Palace was growing powerful again because of some ancient evil.
Village stories, Dr Jones. They're just fear and folklore; you're beginning to worry Captain Blumburtt.
Not worried, Mr Prime Minister, just erm... just erm... interested.
You know, the villagers also told us Pankot Palace had taken something.
Dr Jones, in our country it's not usual for a guest to insult his host.
I'm sorry. I thought we were talking about folklore.
What exactly was it they say was stolen?
A sacred rock.
Hah! You see, Captain? A rock.
Something connected - the villager's rock and the old legend of the Sankara stones.
Dr Jones, we're all vulnerable to vicious rumour. I seem to remember that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than an archaeologist.
Well, the newspapers greatly exaggerated the incident.
And wasn't it the Sultana Madagascar who threatened to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?
No, it wasn't my head.
Then your hands, perhaps?
No, it wasn't my hands... it was my
... misunderstanding.
You want the stones, let 'em go!
Let 'em go!
Drop them, Dr. Jones! They will be found! You won't!
So what are you supposed to be, a lion tamer?
I'm allowing you to tag along. So why don't you give your mouth a rest. Okay doll?
What do you mean ""tag along""? Ever since you got into my club, you haven't been able to take your eyes off of me.
Oh, yeah?
Stop! Look, just - stand against the wall, will ya?
You say to stand against the wall! I listen to what you say! Not my fault! Not my fault!
The biggest trouble with her is the noise.
You know what your problem is, Princess? You're too used to getting your own way.
And you're too proud to admit that you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones!
If you want me Willie, you know where to find me.
Five minutes. You'll be back over here in five minutes.
I'll be asleep in five minutes.
Five. You know it, and I know it.
You betrayed Shiva!
Where's my gun? WHERE'S MY GUN?
I burned by fingers and I cracked a nail!
Aren't you gonna introduce us?
This is Willie Scott; this is Indiana Jones, a famous archaeologist.
Well I always thought that archaeologists were always funny looking men going around looking for their mommies.
Mummies.
Ooh, what big birds!
Those aren't big birds, sweetheart! They're giant vampire bats!
So it's true? You've found Nurhachi?
You know I did. Last night one of your boys tried to get Nurhachi without paying for him.
You have insulted my son.
No, you have insulted me. I spared his life.
Feels like I step on fortune cookie!
It's not fortune cookies. Let me take a look.
That no cookie!
Shorty, where's my razor?
We're in trouble!
Trouble? What kind of trouble?
It's a long story. Better hurry up or you won't get to hear it.
Stay behind me, Short Round. Step where I step, and don't touch anything.
I step where you step! I touch nothing!
Anything can happen. It's a long way to Delhi.
No, thanks. No more adventures with you, Dr. Jones.
Sweetheart, after all the fun we've had together?
If you think I'm going to Delhi with you, or anyplace else after all the trouble you've gotten me into, think again, buster! I'm going home to Missouri where they never feed you snakes before ripping your heart out and lowering you into hot pits! This is NOT my idea of a swell time!
Excuse me, sir. I need a guide to Delhi. If you could...
Oh...
Very funny. Very funny.
Uh-oh!
You never told me you spoke my language, Doctor Jones.
Only on special occasions.
I was happy in Shanghai! I had a little house, and a garden! My friends were rich, we went to parties all the time in limousines! I *hate* being outside!
I'm a singer! I could lose my voice!
I think we'll camp here tonight.
I've got something for you.
There's nothing you have that I could possibly want.
Right.
You're a very nice man.
I suggest you give me what you owe me... or 'Anything Goes!'
Five minutes...
Four and a half...
We weren't brought here. Our plane crashed.
It crashed.
No, no, no. We prayed to Shiva to help us find the stone. It was Shiva who made you fall from sky. So you will go to Pankot Palace... and find Shivalinga... and bring back to us. Bring back to us. Bring back to us.
The antidote!
Where's the diamond?
You could have kept it.
Nah, it would of just been another rock collecting dust.
Yeah, but it would have given you your fortune and glory.
If I have offended you, I am sorry."
Evelyn Carnahan-O'Connell,B,Adventurer Archaeologist,"Look, I... I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure-seeker, or a gunfighter, Mr. O'Connell, but I am proud of what I am.
And what is that?
I... am a librarian.
Oh, I've dreamt about this since I was a little girl.
You dream about dead guys?
What... How... Oh, look at this! Sons of the pharaohs! Give me frogs! Flies! Locusts! Anything but *you*! Compared to you, the other plagues were a joy!
I am so very sorry. It was an accident.
My girl, when Rameses destroyed Syria, that was an accident. You are a *catastrophe*!
Can you swim?
Well, of course I can swim, if the occasion calls for it.
Trust me. It calls for it.
Oh, my God, I *hate* it when these things do that.
Is he supposed to look like that?
No, I've never seen a mummy look like this before. He-He's still... still...
, :
...juicy.
, :
...juicy.
You were actually at Hamunaptra?
Yeah, I was there.
You swear?
Every damn day.
And unlike your brother, Miss, you, I just don't get.
Ah. I know. You're wondering... what is a place like me doing in a girl like this?
Yeah, something like that.
We are part of an ancient secret society. For over three thousand years, we have guarded the City of the Dead. We are sworn at manhood to do any and all in our power to stop the High Priest Imhotep from being reborn into this world.
And now, because of you, we have failed.
And you think this justifies the killing of innocent people?
To stop this creature? Let me think...
, :
*Yes*!
, :
*Yes*!
Patience is a virtue.
Not right now, it isn't.
Let me get this straight. They ripped out your guts and they stuffed them in jars?
And then they take out your heart as well. Oh, and you know how they took out your brains?
Evy, I don't think we need to know this.
They take a sharp, red-hot poker, stick it up your nose, scramble things about a bit, and then rip it all out through your nostrils.
Ooh, that's gotta hurt.
It's called mummification. You'll be dead when they do this.
For the record, if I don't make it out of here, don't put me down for mummification.
Likewise.
You lied to me.
I lie to everybody. What makes you so special?
I am your sister.
Yes, well, that just makes you more gullible.
Oops.
The Book of the Dead? Are you sure you want to be playing around with this thing?
It's just a book. No harm ever came from... reading a book.
Have you got any bright ideas?
I'm thinking, I'm thinking...
You better think of something fast, because, if he turns me into a mummy, you're the first one I'm coming after.
Um... By the way... why did you kiss me?
I was about to be hanged. It seemed like a good idea at the time.
Ooh!
What? What'd I say?
That's called stealing, you know.
According to you and my brother it's called borrowing.
Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.
The only thing that scares me, Mr. O'Connell, are your manners.
Abdul?
Mohammed?
... Bob?
Let's see what our friend the warden believed in.
What?
My God, what is it?
A broken bottle. Glenlivet, twelve years old! Well, he may have been a stinky fellow, but he had good taste.
I thought you said you didn't believe in all this fairy tales and hokum stuff!
Well, having an encounter with a three thousand year old walking, talking corpse does tend to convert one.
Forget it! We're out the door, we're down the hall, and we're gone.
Oh no we are not!
Oh yes we are!
Oh no we are not! We woke him up and we are going stop him!
We? What 'we'? We didn't read that book, I told you not to play around with that thing, didn't I tell you not to play around with that thing?
Yes, that's right, me, me, me, me, I, I, I woke him up and I intend to stop him.
Oh yeah? How? You heard the man, no mortal weapons can kill this guy
Then we're just going to have to find some immortal ones!
There goes that 'we' again, y'know I wonder if-
Ah!
Listen we've got to do something! Once the creature's been reborn his curse is going to spread until the whole of the earth is destroyed!
And is that my problem?
Well it is everybody's problem!
Evelyn, I appreciate you saving my life and all but when I signed on I agreed to take you out there and bring you back, end of job, end of story, contract terminated!
Oh, that's all I am to you, a contract?
Ok look, you can either tag along with me or stay here... and try to save the world! What's it gonna be?
I'm staying.
Fine!
Fine!
Fine.
Fine.
Fine.
Ooh...
, :
Death is only the beginning.
, :
Death is only the beginning.
We must stop him from regenerating. Who opened that chest?
Well, there was me, and Daniels here. Oh, and Burns, of course.
And that Egyptologist feller.
What about my buddy, Beni?
Nah, he scrammed out of there 'fore we opened the damn thing.
Yeah. He was the smart one.
Well, yeah, that sounds like Beni.
There's only one person I know that can possibly give us any answers.
You!
Miss Carnahan. Gentlemen.
What is *he* doing here?
Do you really want to know, or would you prefer to just... shoot us?
After what I just saw, I'm willing to go on a little faith here.
This door doesn't open. She doesn't come out, and no one goes in, right?
Right.
Right?
Right.
O'Connell! Jonathan!
Let's go, Jonathan.
Oh, uh, I thought I could just stay at the fort and, uh, reconnoiter.
Now!
Yeah. Right. We're just gonna rescue the... Egyptologist.
My whole life, I've never found anything, Evy. *Please* tell me I've found something.
Jonathan?
Yes?
I think you found something.
Well, personally, I think he's filthy, rude, a complete scoundrel. I don't like him one bit.
Anyone I know?
Keep him busy.
No problem.
What do you suppose killed him?
Did you ever see him eat?
Oh, for heaven's sake, girl, it wasn't that good of a kiss, anyway.
Oh, my God. It's a... it's a sarcophagus. Buried at the base of Anubis. He must have been someone of great importance. Or he did something *very* naughty.
You know, nasty little fellows such as yourself always get their comeuppance.
Really? They do?
Oh, yes. Always.
The map! The map! I forgot the map!
Relax. I'm the map. It's all up here.
Oh, that's comforting.
So, what exactly is this man in prison for?
Well, this I did not know. But when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
Hurry up!
And what did he say?
He said he was just looking for a good time.
Have you no respect for the dead?
Of course I do. But sometimes... I'd rather like to join them.
Well, I wish you would do it sooner rather than later before you ruin my career the way you've ruined yours.
It's the creature. He's fully regenerated.
Come with me, my princess. It is time to make you mine, forever.
For all eternity, idiot.
Take my hand and I will spare your friends.
What was that?
Sounds like... bugs.
He said bugs.
What do you mean, bugs? I hate bugs!
Mister O'Connell, can you look me in the eye, and guarantee me that this isn't all some kind of a flimflam?
I will give you one hundred pounds to save this man's life.
Madame, I would *pay* one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
Two! Two hundred pounds!
Proceed.
Three hundred pounds!
Five hundred pounds!
And what else?
I'm a very lonely man.
Ha, ha! His neck did not break! Oh, I'm so sorry. Now, we must watch him strangle to death.
He knows the location to Hamunaptra.
You lie.
I would never!
Are you telling me this filthy, godless son of a pig knows where to find the City of the Dead?
Yes.
Truly?
Yes! And if you cut him down, we will give you... ten percent.
Fifty percent.
Twenty!
Forty!
Thirty!
Twenty-five!
Ah! Deal!
Agh! Cut him down!
Where are they taking him?
To be hanged. Apparently, he had a *very* good time.
Stop it! You'll kill them!
That's the idea.
You see the cartouche there? It's the official royal seal of Seti the First, I'm sure of it.
Perhaps.
Two questions. Who the hell was Seti the First, *and* was he rich?
He was the second pharaoh of the 19th dynasty, said to be the wealthiest pharaoh of them all.
Good. That's good. I like this fellow. I like him very much."

At every stage of this disaster, which came within moments of being a far greater disaster, the officers and crew did what had to be done. Seven are now dead and nobody knows how many more are dying, or how fast. These are the men who returned home to be interrogated as if a crime had been committed, questioned, even while undergoing treatment for radiation poisoning, locked up and denied access to wives and families but they and their comrades saved K-19 and maybe, just maybe, they saved all of you as well. one thing more, please, no captain in the soviet navy has ever been faced with such decisions the fate of the boat, the crew, and the fate of the world all in balance. The navy is my life. And one thing I know, there can only be one captain of a ship. The burden of command is on his shoulders, and his alone. None of you - none of you - has the right to judge captain Vostrikov. You weren't there. I was. He was our captain. He was my captain. And it would be an honor to sail under his command again.
Where are the radiation protective suits?
We don't have any. The warehouse was out, so they sent us chemical protective suits instead.
They might as well wear raincoats.
They might as well wear raincoats.
It's never difficult to do one's duty, Captain.
All compartments: report readiness!"
Capt. Nathan Cutting Brittles,AH,Father To His Men,"Never apologize. It's a sign of weakness.
Sir, would you take a look at Trooper Smith?
Don't bother about me, Captain. Trust you'll forgive my presumption... I'd like to commend the boy here... for the way he handled this action. In the best tradition of the cavalry, sir.
I take that very kindly, sir.
Captain Tyree! Captain Tyree!
Speak to him.
Thank you.
Yes, Sir. Sir! Sir!
I'm afraid he can't hear you, Captain.
Hey, Nathan! Nathan! I am a Christian! Hallelujah! Old friend, me. Long time. Long time.
I come in peace, Pony That Walks.
Talk a salt, Nathan. Take salt. Smoke pipe. Good. Good.
Pony That Walks, my heart is sad at what I see. Your young men painted for war. Their scalp knives red. The medicine drums talking. It is a bad thing!
A bad thing, Nathan. Many will die. My young men, your young men. No good. No good.
We must stop this war.
Too late, Nathan. Young men do not listen to me. They listen to Big Medicine. Yellow Hair Custer dead. Buffalo come back. Red sun. Too late, Nathan! You will come with me. Hunt buffalo together. Smoke many pipes. We are too old for war.
Yes, we are too old for war. But old men should stop wars.
Too late, too late! Many squaws will sing the Death Songs. Many lodges will be empty. You come with me, we hunt buffalo, get drunk together! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
No, friend, I must go. I go far away.
Then, Nathan, my brother, go in peace.
How did ""Marching Through Georgia"" take the idea of ""Old Iron Pants"" riding with him?
Under protest, my dear.
Under WRITTEN protest, Abby, of course. It's always my pleasure to escort ""Old Iron Pants."" Well, as long as you're going along with us, I guess we'll have...
Abby, that is the dad-blastedest outfit I ever did see. Quincannon's old britches.
You got a breath on you like a hot mince pie.
Ah, Captain darlin', as you well know I took ""the pledge"" after Chapultepec.
And Bull Run, and Gettysburg, and Shiloh, and St. Patrick's Day, and Fourth of July!
The army will never be the same when we retire, sir.
The army is always the same. The sun and the moon change, but the army knows no seasons.
I also commend to your keeping, Sir, the soul of Rome Clay, late Brigadier General, Confederate States Army. Known to his comrades here, Sir, as Trooper John Smith, United States Cavalry... a gallant soldier and a Christian gentleman.
You don't have to say it, Captain. I know all this is because of me; because I wanted to see the West; because I wasn't - I wasn't ""Army"" enough to stay the winter.
You're not quite ""Army"" yet, miss... or you'd know never to apologize... it's a sign of weakness.
Yes, but this was your last patrol and I'm to blame for it.
Only the man who commands can be blamed. It rests on me... mission failure!
Where will you go, Nathan?
Oh, West, I guess, Abby... California... new settlements.
""Old soldiers..."", Miss Dandridge... hah! Someday you'll learn how they hate to give up. Captain of the troop one day: every man's face turned towards you; lieutenants jump when I growl! Now, tomorrow, I'll be glad if a blacksmith asks me to shoe a horse.
""To Capt. Brittles from C Troop. Lest we forget.""
Button your shirt, Mister Pennell! Thought better of you. Four years out here and still actin' like a wet-eared ""kaydet"" on the Hudson. What is this all about, Mr. Cohill?
Sir, I... I decline to answer... respectfully.
Mr. Cohill, it is a bitter thing, indeed, to learn that an officer who has had nine years experience in the cavalry - the officer to whom I am surrendering command of this troop in two more days - should have so little grasp of leadership as to allow himself to be chivvied into a go at fisticuffs while 'Taps' still sounds over a brave man's grave! God help this troop when I'm gone.
So Nathan Brittles, ex-captain of cavalry U.S.A., started westward for the new settlements in California: westward toward the setting sun, which is the end of the trail for all old men. But the army hadn't finished with Nathan Brittles and it sent a galloper after him. THAT was Sgt. Tyree's department.
Yo-oh! Capt. Brittles!
Captain, sir.
Huh?
For you, sir. From the Yankee War Department.
I knew it. Dad blast it... I knew it!
What? Sergeant... my appointment: chief of scouts! With a rank of Lt. Colonel. And will you look at those endorsements: Phil Sheridan, William Tecumseh Sherman and Ulysses Simpson Grant, President of The United States of America! There's three aces for you, boy!
Yeah, but I kinda wish you'da been a-holdin' a full hand.
Huh? Full hand? Whaddaya mean: full hand?
Robert E. Lee, sir.
Oh. Heh... wouldn't a been bad. Let's go.
Were you ever scared, ""Captain"" Tyree?
Yes, sir. Up to and includin' now.
I'm sorry I made such a fool of myself at the gate this morning.
You made a fool out of a couple of young lieutenants. That's never against Army regulations.
I don't know where you got your brains, Sergeant - God must have given you that pair of eyes. They're Arapahos, alright. Headin' the same way we are. Now why would they be movin' on Sudrow's Wells, Sergeant? Answer me that.
My mother didn't raise any sons to be makin' guesses in front of Yankee captains.
Well, on my way. Goodbye, Mac. Say goodbye to Abby.
And you'll do no such thing, Nathan Brittles. 'Goodbye' is a word we don't use in the cavalry. To our next posting...
Nice girl... reminds me of you.
I'm sorry, sir...
Oh, shut up!
Sgt. Tyree, I'm ordering you to volunteer again.
How many *r's* in territory?
Two.
Where are you going, Mr. Penell?
Picnic-ing, sir.
Picnic-ing?
Picnic-ing, Miss Dandridge? Where, in St Louis?
Sidesaddle, Riley?
Sidesaddle, sir.
Give 'em a wide berth. Mr Cohill, past Sudrow's Wells by way of Twin Forks.
We'll lose half a day, sir.
The ladies will miss their stage, sir
Would you rather have them miss their scalps, sir?
Join me in a chaw of tobacco?
No, sir. I don't chaw and I don't play cards.
Chawing tobacco is a nasty habit. Been known to turn a man's stomach.
I'll take a chaw if you please, sir."
Maximus Decimus Meridius,AH,Father To His Men,"Rise. Rise.
Your fame is well deserved, Spaniard. I don't think there's ever been a gladiator to match you. As for this young man, he insists you are Hector reborn. Or was it Hercules? Why doesn't the hero reveal himself and tell us all your real name? You do have a name.
My name is Gladiator.
How dare you show your back to me! Slave, you will remove your helmet and tell me your name.
My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius, commander of the Armies of the North, General of the Felix Legions and loyal servant to the TRUE emperor, Marcus Aurelius. Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife. And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next.
Arms!
Are you not entertained? Are you not entertained? Is this not why you are here?
Spaniard, Spaniard, Spaniard...
The general who became a slave. The slave who became a gladiator. The gladiator who defied an emperor. Striking story! But now, the people want to know how the story ends. Only a famous death will do. And what could be more glorious than to challenge the Emperor himself in the great arena?
You would fight me?
Why not? Do you think I am afraid?
I think you've been afraid all your life.
Fratres!
Three weeks from now, I will be harvesting my crops. Imagine where you will be, and it will be so. Hold the line! Stay with me! If you find yourself alone, riding in the green fields with the sun on your face, do not be troubled. For you are in Elysium, and you're already dead!
Brothers, what we do in life... echoes in eternity.
At my signal, unleash hell.
I knew a man once who said, ""Death smiles at us all. All a man can do is smile back.""
I wonder, did your friend smile at his own death?
You must know. He was your father.
You loved my father, I know. But so did I. That makes us brothers, doesn't it? Smile for me now, brother.
Strength and honor.
Nothing happens to anyone that he is not fitted by nature to bear
People should know when they are conquered.
Would you, Quintus? Would I?
You don't find it hard to do your duty?
Sometimes I do what I want to do. The rest of the time, I do what I have to.
Five thousand of my men are out there in the freezing mud. Three thousand of them are bloodied and cleaved. Two thousand will never leave this place. I will not believe that they fought and died for nothing.
And what would you believe?
They fought for you and for Rome.
And what is Rome, Maximus?
I've seen much of the rest of the world. It is brutal and cruel and dark, Rome is the light.
Yet you have never been there. You have not seen what it has become. I am dying, Maximus. When a man sees his end... he wants to know there was some purpose to his life. How will the world speak my name in years to come? Will I be known as the philosopher? The warrior? The tyrant...? Or will I be the emperor who gave Rome back her true self? There was once a dream that was Rome. You could only whisper it. Anything more than a whisper and it would vanish... it was so fragile. And I fear that it will not survive the winter.
What am I going to do with you? You simply won't... die. Are we so different, you and I? You take life when you have to... as I do.
I have only one more life to take. Then it is done.
Then take it now.
They tell me your son...
...squealed like a girl when they nailed him to the cross. And your wife... moaned like a whore when they ravaged her again and again... and again.
The time for honoring yourself will soon be at an end.
Highness.
Ancestors, I ask you for your guidance. Blessed mother, come to me with the Gods' desire for my future. Blessed father, watch over my wife and son with a ready sword. Whisper to them that I live only to hold them again, for all else is dust and air. Ancestors, I honor you and will try to live with the dignity that you have taught me.
The frost, it sometimes makes the blade stick.
Won't you accept this great honor that I have offered you?
With all my heart, no.
Maximus, that is why it must be you.
Quintus! Release my men. Senator Gracchus is to be reinstated. There was a dream that was Rome. It shall be realized. These are the wishes of Marcus Aurelius.
When was the last time you were home?
Two years, two hundred and sixty-four days and this morning.
Can they hear you?
Who?
Your family. In the afterlife.
Oh yes.
What do you say to them?
To my son - I tell him I will see him again soon. To keep his heels down while riding his horse. To my wife... that is not your business.
Are you in danger of becoming a good man, Proximo?
Ha!
And after your glorious coup, what then? You take your five thousand and... leave?
Yes, I will leave. The soldiers will stay here for your protection, under the guidance of the Senate.
So, after Rome's all yours, you just give it back to the people. Tell me why.
Because that was a dying man's last wish. I will kill Commodus. The fate of Rome, I leave to you.
Marcus Aurelius trusted you. His daughter trusts you. I will trust you. Give me two days, and I will purchase your freedom. And you, stay alive, or I'll be dead.
Congratulations, you have very persuasive friends.
My brother's had Gracchus arrested. We daren't wait any longer. We must leave tonight. Proximo will be here t midnight and take you to the gate. Your servant, Cicero will be waiting there with horses.
You have done all this?
Yes.
You risk too much.
I have much to pay for.
You have nothing to pay for. You love your son, you are strong for him.
I am tired of being strong.(sighs) My brother hates all the world and you most of all.
Because your father chose me.
No because my father loved you... and because I loved you.
A long time ago.
Was I very different then?
(shakes his head, touches her face with his finger) You laughed more.
I have felt alone all my life, except with you. I must go.
Yes.
He knows too well how to manipulate the mob.
Marcus Aurelius had a dream that was Rome, Proximo. That is not it. That is not it!
Marcus Aurelius is dead, Maximus. We mortals are but shadows and dust. Shadows and dust, Maximus!
What did my father want with you?
To wish me well before I leave for home.
You're lying, I could always tell when you were lying because you were never any good at it.
I never acquired your comfort with it.
True, but then you never had to, life is more simple for a soldier. Or do you think me heartless?
I think you have a talent for survival.
Quintus, look at me. Look at me! Promise me that you'll look after my family.
Your family will meet you in the afterlife.
You knew Marcus Aurelius?
I didn't say I knew him, I said he touched me on the shoulder once!
On this day, we reach back to hallowed antiquity, to bring you a recreation of the second fall of the mighty Carthage!... On the barren plain of Zama, there stood the invincible armies of the barbarian Hannibal. Ferocious mercenaires and warriors from all brute nations, bent on merciless destruction, conquest. Your emperor is pleased to give you the barbarian horde!
Anyone here been in the army?
You can help me. Whatever comes out of these gates, we've got a better chance of survival if we work together. Do you understand? If we stay together we survive.
I'm pleased to bring to you the Legionnaires of Scipio Africanus!
Gladiator, are you the one they call the Spaniard?
Yes.
They said you were a giant. They said you could crush a man's skull with one hand.
A man's? No. A boy's...
They have good horses in Spain?
Some of the best.
This is Argento, and this is Scarto. They were my horses. They were taken from me.
I like you Spaniard, and I shall cheer for you.
They let you watch the games?
My uncle says it makes me strong.
And what does your father say?
My father's dead.
Master Lucius, it is time.
I have to go.
Thy name is Lucius?
Lucius Verus, after my father.
You have proven your valor once again, Maximus. Let us hope for the last time.
There is no one left to fight, sire.
There is always someone left to fight. How can I reward Rome's greatest general?
Let me go home.
Ah, home.
They say, ""No.""
I may die here in this cell or in the arena tomorrow. What possible difference can I make?
This man wants what you want.
Then have *him* kill Commodus!
Do you remember what it was to have trust, Proximo?
Trust?
Lucius is safe.
I want to help you.
Yes, you can help me... Forget you ever knew me, and never come back here again.
I am required to kill, so I kill. That is enough.
That's enough for the provinces, but not enough for Rome.
Five thousand of my men are out there in the freezing mud. Three thousand of them are bloodied and cleaved. Two thousand will never leave this place. I will not believe they fought and died for nothing.
Maximus, please be careful, that wasn't prudent.
Prudent? The Emperor has been slain.
He killed the man who set you free.
Soldier! I told you to move those catapults forward. They're out of range.
Range is good.
The danger to the cavalry...
Is acceptable. Agreed?
Tell me again, Maximus, why are we here?
For the glory of the Empire, sire.
Roma Ignis"
Captain Benjamin L. Willard,AH,Father To His Men,"Saigon... shit; I'm still only in Saigon... Every time I think I'm gonna wake up back in the jungle.
When I was home after my first tour, it was worse.
I'd wake up and there'd be nothing. I hardly said a word to my wife, until I said ""yes"" to a divorce. When I was here, I wanted to be there; when I was there, all I could think of was getting back into the jungle. I'm here a week now... waiting for a mission... getting softer. Every minute I stay in this room, I get weaker, and every minute Charlie squats in the bush, he gets stronger. Each time I looked around the walls moved in a little tighter.
""Never get out of the boat."" Absolutely goddamn right! Unless you were goin' all the way... Kurtz got off the boat. He split from the whole fuckin' program.
Did they say why, Willard, why they want to terminate my command?
I was sent on a classified mission, sir.
It's no longer classified, is it? Did they tell you?
They told me that you had gone totally insane, and that your methods were unsound.
Are my methods unsound?
I don't see any method at all, sir.
I expected someone like you. What did you expect? Are you an assassin?
I'm a soldier.
You're neither. You're an errand boy, sent by grocery clerks, to collect a bill.
Could we, uh... talk to Colonel Kurtz?
Hey, man, you don't talk to the Colonel. You listen to him. The man's enlarged my mind. He's a poet warrior in the classic sense. I mean sometimes he'll... uh... well, you'll say ""hello"" to him, right? And he'll just walk right by you. He won't even notice you. And suddenly he'll grab you, and he'll throw you in a corner, and he'll say, ""Do you know that 'if' is the middle word in life? If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you, if you can trust yourself when all men doubt you""... I mean I'm... no, I can't... I'm a little man, I'm a little man, he's... he's a great man! I should have been a pair of ragged claws scuttling across floors of silent seas...
Your mission is to proceed up the Nung River in a Navy patrol boat. Pick up Colonel Kurtz's path at Nu Mung Ba, follow it and learn what you can along the way. When you find the Colonel, infiltrate his team by whatever means available and terminate the Colonel's command.
Terminate the Colonel?
He's out there operating without any decent restraint, totally beyond the pale of any acceptable human conduct. And he is still in the field commanding troops.
Terminate with extreme prejudice.
You understand, Captain, that this mission does not exist, nor will it ever exist...
I was going to the worst place in the world and I didn't even know it yet. Weeks away and hundreds of miles up a river that snaked through the war like a main circuit cable plugged straight into Kurtz. It was no accident that I got to be the caretaker of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz's memory any more than being back in Saigon was an accident. There is no way to tell his story without telling my own. And if his story really is a confession, then so is mine.
Everyone gets everything he wants. I wanted a mission, and for my sins, they gave me one. Brought it up to me like room service. It was a real choice mission, and when it was over, I never wanted another.
How many people had I already killed? There were those six that I knew about for sure. Close enough to blow their last breath in my face. But this time, it was an American and an officer. That wasn't supposed to make any difference to me, but it did. Shit... charging a man with murder in this place was like handing out speeding tickets in the Indy 500. I took the mission. What the hell else was I gonna do?
No wonder Kurtz put a weed up Command's ass. The war was being run by a bunch of four star clowns who were gonna end up giving the whole circus away.
Are you crazy, Goddammit? Don't you think its a little risky for some R&R;?
If I say its safe to surf this beach, Captain, then its safe to surf this beach! I mean, I'm not afraid to surf this place, I'll surf this whole fucking place!
Oh man... the bullshit piled up so fast in Vietnam, you needed wings to stay above it.
The machinist, the one they called Chef, was from New Orleans. He was wrapped too tight for Vietnam; probably wrapped too tight for New Orleans. Lance, on the forward .50s, was a famous surfer from the beaches south of LA. One look at him and you wouldn't believe he ever fired a weapon in his whole life. Clean... Mr. Clean... was from some South Bronx shithole and the light and space of Vietnam really put the zap on his head. Then there was Phillips, the Chief. It might have been my mission, but it sure as shit was the Chief's boat!
""Someday this war's gonna end"". That'd be just fine with the boys on the boat. They weren't looking for anything more than a way home. Trouble is, I'd been back there, and I knew that it just didn't exist anymore.
Everybody wanted me to do it, him most of all. I felt like he was up there, waiting for me to take the pain away. He just wanted to go out like a soldier, standing up, not like some poor, wasted, rag-assed renegade. Even the jungle wanted him dead, and that's who he really took his orders from anyway.
The First of the Ninth was a old calvary division that traded in their horses for helicopters and went tear-assing around 'Nam looking for the shit...
In a war there are many moments for compassion and tender action. There are many moments for ruthless action - what is often called ruthless - what may in many circumstances be only clarity, seeing clearly what there is to be done and doing it, directly, quickly, awake, looking at it.
What are you talking about?
We're taking her to some friendlies, Captain. She's wounded, she's not dead.
Get off there, Chef.
Fuck it!
I told you not to stop. Now let's go!
If that's how Kilgore fought the war, I began to wonder what they really had against Kurtz. It wasn't just insanity and murder; there was enough of that to go around for everyone.
Hey soldier, do you know who's in command here?
Ain't you?
On the river, I thought that the minute I looked at him, I'd know what to do, but it didn't happen. I was in there with him for days, not under guard; I was free, but he knew I wasn't going anywhere. He knew more about what I was going to do than I did. If the generals back in Nha Trang could see what I saw, would they still want me to kill him? More than ever, probably. And what would his people back home want if they ever learned just how far from them he'd really gone? He broke from them, and then he broke from himself. I'd never seen a man so broken up and ripped apart.
Charlie didn't get much USO. He was dug in too deep or moving too fast. His idea of great R&R; was cold rice and a little rat meat. He had only two ways home: death, or victory.
My orders say I'm not supposed to know where I'm taking this boat, so I don't! But one look at you, and I know it's gonna be hot!
We're going up river about 75 klicks above the Do Lung bridge.
That's Cambodia, captain.
That's classified. We're not supposed to be in Cambodia, but that's where I'm going.
As for the charges against me, I am unconcerned. I am beyond their timid lying morality, and so I am beyond caring.
They were gonna make me a Major for this, and I wasn't even in their fuckin' army anymore.
Your report specifies intelligence/counterintelligence with ComSec I-Corps.
I'm not presently disposed to discuss these operations, sir.
Did you not work for the CIA in I-Corps?
No, sir.
Did you not assassinate a government tax collector in Quang Tri province, June 19th, 1968? Captain?
Sir, I am unaware of any such activity or operation... nor would I be disposed to discuss such an operation if it did in fact exist, sir.
It's a way we had over here for living with ourselves. We cut 'em in half with a machine gun and give 'em a Band-Aid. It was a lie. And the more I saw them, the more I hated lies.
Do you know why you can never step into the same river twice?
Yeah, 'cause it's always moving.
I wish I had words, man. I wish I had words... I can tell ya something like the other day he wanted to kill me. Somethin' like that...
Why'd he wanna kill you?
Because I took his picture. He said ""If you take my picture again, I'm gonna kill you."" And he *meant* it.
You don't understand our mentality - the French officer mentality. At first, we lose in Second World War. I don't say that you Americans win, but we lose. In Dien Bien Phu, we lose. In Algeria, we lose. In Indochina, we lose! But here, we don't lose! This piece of earth, we keep it. We will never lose it, never!
You Americans. In 1945, yeah, after the Japanese war, your president Roosevelt didn't want the French people to stay in Indochina. So, you Americans implant the Vietnam.
What's he mean?
Yeah, that's true. The Vietcong were invented by the Americans, sir.
The Americans?
And now you take the French place. And the Vietnam fight you. And what can you do? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
The Vietnamese are very intelligent. You never know what they think. The Russian ones who help them, ""come and give us their money. We are all Communists. Chinese give us guns. We are all brothers.""... They hate the Chinese! Maybe they hate the American less than the Russian and the Chinese. I mean, if tomorrow the Vietnamese are Communists they will be *Vietnamese* Communists. And this is something you never understood, you American.
I don't know. Maybe in the future we can make something with the Vietnam.
Don't you understand? The VC say, ""go away, go away"". That's finish for all the white people in Indochina. If you're French, American, that's all the same. ""Go."" They want to forget you. Look, Captain. Look, this is the truth. An egg.
The white left, but the yellow stays.
Captain, are you giving away our fuel for a Playmate of the Month?
No, Playmate of the Year, Chief!
He was close, real close. I couldn't see him yet, but I could feel him, as if the boat were being sucked upriver and the water was flowing back into the jungle. Whatever was going to happen, it wasn't gonna be the way they call it back in Nha Trang.
My mission is to make it up into Cambodia. There's a Green Beret Colonel up there who's gone insane. I'm supposed to kill him.
What? Oh, that's typical! Shit! Fuckin' Vietnam mission! I'm short, and we gotta go up there so you can kill one of our own guys? That's fuckin' great! That's just fuckin' great! Shit! That's fuckin' crazy! I thought you were going in there to blow up a bridge, or some fucking railroad tracks or something!
I'm sorry. Look, I'll cut you loose here and you can turn around and...
No, no, we go together... on the boat! We came this far, so we go together. All the way! We'll take you up there, we'll go with you... but on the boat! Okay?
The crew were mostly kids; rock & rollers with one foot in their grave.
Part of me was afraid of what I would find and what I would do when I got there. I knew the risks, or imagined I knew. But the thing I felt the most, much stronger than fear, was the desire to confront him.
I'm Lt. Carlsen. I was sent from Nha Trang with this message for you three days ago, sir. They expected you here a little sooner. This is mail for the boat's crew. You don't know how happy this makes me in delivering all this.
Why?
Because now I can get out of here... if I can find a way.
You're in the asshole of the world, Captain!
Who's in charge here?
In charge? I don't know, man. I'm just doing what I'm told - I'm just a working girl.
I was supposed to go to Paris, study at the Escoffier School. That's when I got my orders. Well, I joined the Navy. Heard they had better food. Cook school, that did it.
Oh yeah? How's that?
They lined us up in front of a hundred yards of prime rib. All of us, you know, lined up and looking at it. Magnificent meat! Really! Beautifully marbled... magnifique! Next thing, they're throwing the meat into these big cauldrons. All of it, boiling it. I looked inside, man, and it was turning gray. I couldn't fuckin' believe that one!
Where are you from, Willard?
I'm from Ohio, sir.
Were you born there?
Yes, sir.
Whereabouts?
Toledo, sir.
How far are you from the river?
The Ohio River, sir?
Uh-huh.
About 200 miles.
I went down that river once when I was a kid. There's a place in that river - I can't remember - must have been a gardenia plantation at one time. It's all wild and overgrown now, but about five miles, you'd think that heaven just fell on the earth in the form of gardenias. Have you considered any real freedoms? Freedoms from the opinions of others. Even the opinions of yourself.
Well, he wasn't a bad officer, I guess. He loved his boys, and he felt safe with 'em. He was just one of those guys with that weird light around him. He just knew he wasn't gonna get so much as a scratch here."
Captain of the 'Weser',AH,Father To His Men,"So, what's it like down there, in a submarine?
It's... quiet.
Quiet? Hmm.
Welcome aboard the Weser, Herr Kapitänleutnant.
No, not me. This is the Captain.
Ah. My apologies."
Captain Nemo,AH,Father To His Men,"I've been waiting all week to do that.
Get a grip, man.
Well, I thought I just did.
Oooh, Mina...
Report.
Well, hello to you, too. And need I remind you, I am naked in the snow. I can't feel any of my extremities. And I mean... any of them.
Well, we were the faster, but now we're the tortoise to his hare.
So, we're done?
No, we're alive. If M has any idea to the contrary, that gives us an edge.
The sea is vast, he could be anywhere.
Yeah, well, I'm an optimist, now maybe that's a crime to you twisted so-and-so's but it keeps me from going crazy.
Your optimism's out of place.
You're wrong! Because we'll get out, man... at least, I will. That other agent I told you about... was my childhood friend. We were agents together until the Fantom shot him dead. Now you can be done, but I am not. I will avenge his death.
It's not about any one of us, Tom, it's bigger than that.
Yes, it is, Jekyll! The fate for the world is in our hands... the world! So M tricked you, he brought you all together and you walked straight into his trap. But the way that I see it, that's the part he did wrong... He brought you together.
He has a point.
And the boy becomes a man... perhaps a leader of men.
And Women.
I may have been overly rude earlier... when I called you a pirate.
And I may have been overly charitable... when I said I wasn't. But I try to live in the now... where the ghosts of old wrongs do not abide.
What is that thing?
It's me on a bad day.
Draw your pistol.
I walk a different path.
What is it?
The sound of treachery.
We have trouble.
Trouble? I call it sport.
This is my first mate.
Call me Ishmael, please.
We can track it.
Track it? I intend to catch it!
Shall I wait, Captain?
No, bring my lady to me.
The Phantom is M. And the hunt is still on.
What are you talking about?
The Phantom is M. The same man who recruited us.
Let me see that.
But how?
We'll get our answers. Where are the others?
Dorian's missing in action. And Mr. Skinner must have fled when he realized we knew.
Sawyer?
He'll live to fight another day.
Don't worry, I've had my fill of throats for this evening.
Contain your evil, Doctor. I'll not have the brute free upon my ship. Must I take drastic steps?
I am in control.
I very much doubt it.
Your talk is all well and good, sir... but your own past is far from laudable.
You underestimate the Nautilus. You underestimate her greatly.
Oh, scotch anyone?
Help yourself.
Don't let it ruin your makeup.
I'm impressed, Mr. Gray. You take Skinner's uniqueness in your stride.
Well, I've seen too much in my life to shock easily.
Behold Nautilus; the Sword of the Ocean. Next stop Paris.
Extraordinary!"
Capt. James 'Bugger' Staros,AH,Father To His Men,"You are my sons, my dear sons. You live inside me now. I'll carry you wherever I go.
I've lived with these men, sir, for two and a half years and I will not order them all to their deaths.
The tough part is, uh... Not knowing if you're doing any good. That's the hard part.
You're my light. My guide."
Gen. Robert E. Lee,AH,Father To His Men,"You wish to see me, sir?
It is the opinion of some... excellent officers that you have let us all down.
General Lee, sir, if you will please tell me who these gentlemen are...
There will be none of that. There is no time.
Sir, I only ask that I be allowed to defend my...
There is no time.
General Stuart... your mission was to free this army from the enemy cavalry and report any movement by the enemy's main body. That mission was not fulfilled. You left here with no word of your movement or movement of the enemy for several days. Meanwhile, we were engaged here and drawn into battle without adequate knowledge of the enemy's strength or position, without knowledge of the ground. So it is only by God's grace that we did not meet disaster here.
General Lee, there were reasons...
Perhaps you misunderstood my orders? Perhaps I did not make myself clear. Well, sir... this must be made *very* clear. You, sir, with your cavalry, are the eyes of this army. Without your cavalry, we are made blind. That has already happened once. It must never, *never* happen again.
Sir... since I no longer hold the General's...
I have *told* you, there is no time for that! There is no time!
There is another fight comin' tomorrow, and we need you. We need every man, God knows. You must take what I have told you, and learn from it, as a man does.
There has been a mistake. It will not happen again; I know your quality. You are one of the finest cavalry officers I have ever known, and your service to this army has been invaluable. Now... let us speak no more of this.
The matter is concluded. Good night, General.
To be a good soldier you must love the army. To be a good commander you must be able to order the death of the thing you love.
Gen. Longstreet, do you mind if I accompany you?
Not at all. I am very glad to have you with us, Sir.
The heat reminds me of Mexico.
Yes, but the air was very dry.
That was a good outfit. I remember storming the ramparts of Chapultepec with old George Pickett, REynolds, my old friend Ulysses Sam Grant. There was some good men in that army.
Yes sir, there were indeed.
Some of those men are waiting for us now up ahead on those ridges.
I don't know. I sometimes feel troubled. Those fellas - those boys in blue - they never quite seem the enemy.
I know.
I used to command some of those boys. Swore an oath too. Ah... I - I couldn't fight against Georgia, South Carolina. Not against my own family...
No Sir. There was always a higher duty to Virginia. That was our first duty. There was never any question or doubt about that.
Guess so.
Let us no think about that now. The issue is in God's hands. We can only do our duty.
General, soldiering has one great trap: to be a good solider you must love the army. To be a good commander, you must be willing to order the death of the thing you love. We do not fear our own death you and I. But there comes a time...
We are never quite prepared for so many to die. Oh, we do expect the occasional empty chair. A salute to fallen comrades. But this war goes on and on and the men die and the price gets ever higher. We are prepared to loose some of us, but we are never prepared to loose all of us. And there is the great trap General. When you attack, you must hold nothing back. You must commit yourself totally. We are adrift here in a sea of blood and I want it to end. I want this to be the final battle.
General, you must look to your division.
General Lee... I have no division.
This is almost perfect, now we got them where we want them. Swing south and east, down the road, get between them and Lincoln, find some good high ground, then they'll have to hit us, they'll have to, we'll have them, sir.
You mean disengage?
Well sir, I've always been under the impression that it was our strategy to conduct a defensive campaign wherever possible in order to keep the army intact.
Granted, but the situation has changed now.
In what way?
We've already pushed them back, they're on the run, vacating the town. How can we move off to the south and the east in the face of the enemy? What are you thinking, General?
Maybe we should not have fought here?
I know that. But we have prevailed. The men have prevailed.
Yes sir, they have always done that. But in the morning we may be outnumbered, and they'll be entrenched on the high ground.
General, you know as well as I, we have never concerned ourselves with being outnumbered.
That is true, sir, you are right. If we move to the south to Washington, they have to pursue us, and then we can fight on ground of our choosing.
But the enemy is here! We did not want the fight but the fight is here! How can I ask this army to retreat in the face of what they have done this day?
Not retreat, sir. Re-deploy.
Our guns will move them off that hill or Ewell will push them off. But if Meade is there tomorrow, I cannot move this army away, no sir, I will attack him.
General, if Meade is up there tomorrow, it is because he wants us to attack him. We pushed back two corps, but there are five more coming.
General Trimble is waiting. Will you see him now?
Very well.
Major, I want a scouting party sent out posthaste to find General Stuart.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Right away, sir.
General Trimble.
Sir, I most respectfully request another assignment.
Do please go on, General.
The man is a disgrace! Sir, have you been listening at all to... to what the aides have been telling you? Ask General Gordon or General Ewell. Ask them. We could've taken that hill! God in His wisdom knows we *should've* taken it! There was no one there, no there at all, and it commanded the town.
General Gordon saw it. I mean, he was with us! Me and Ewell and Gordon, all standing there in the dark like fat, great idiots with that bloody damned hill empty!
I beg your pardon, General.
That bloody damned hill was bare as his bloody damned head! We all saw it, as God is my witness! We were all there. I said to him, ""General Ewell, we have *got* to take that hill."" General Jackson would not have stopped like this, with the bluebellies on the run and there was plenty of light left on a hill like that empty! Well, God help us, I... I don't know wh... I don't know why I...
Do please continue, General.
Yes, sir. Sir... I said to him, General Ewell, these words. I said to him, ""Sir, give me one division and I will take that hill."" And he said nothing. He just stood there, he stared at me. I said, ""General Ewell, give me one brigade and I will take that hill."" I was becoming disturbed, sir. And General Ewell put his arms behind him and blinked. So I said, General, give me one *regiment* and I will take that hill."" And he said *nothing*! He just stood there! I threw down my sword, down on the ground in front of him!
We... we could've done it, sir. A blind man should've seen it. Now they're working up there. You can hear the axes of the Federal troops. And so in the morning... many a good boy will die... taking that hill.

In the morning is the great battle. Tomorrow or the next day will determine the war. Virginia is here. All the South is here. What will you do tomorrow? In the morning, the enemy will be up in fortified positions on high ground. Longstreet's corps will be coming up, and... my boys'll be ready to finish the job. If I tell them to withdraw now... no, sir. They've been patient for far too long. With the enemy out there up on the hill, they'll be ready to finish the job. But I don't even know how much is up there. How many men? How many cannon? I don't know the ground or the flanks. I don't know. If I wait in the morning, the early morning, maybe Meade, under pressure, will attack. Hmm. That would make General Longstreet very happy. But I don't think Meade will come down. And I don't think I can withdraw. So... God's will. Thy will be done.
But this war goes on and on and the men die and the price gets even higher. We are prepared to lose some of us, but we are never prepared to lose all of us. We are adrift here in a sea of blood and I want it to end. I want this to be the final battle.
What day is it now, Major?
It's long after midnight, sir. It's already Friday.
Friday, July the 3rd?
Yes, sir.
Then tomorrow is the Fourth of July.
Sir?
Independence Day?
Huh. I'd quite forgotten.
The good Lord has a sense of humor. I'm very sorry to keep you up so late.
It is my pleasure, sir.
We should have a larger staff.
I would be insulted, sir.
In the morning, there's to be a great battle. Tomorrow or the next day will determine the war.
This is all my fault.
He says the lead element is here with the Third Corps...
... the Sixth right behind...
... supported by a column of Federal cavalry. Seven corps altogether. The First and Eleventh are above Taneytown, and there's more cavalry two hours east. There may be as many as 100,000 altogether.
Do you believe the man, this Mr. Harrison?
No choice. Oh, you remember him, sir; the actor from Mississippi?
An actor? We move on the word of an actor?
Can't afford not to.
There would be some word from General Stuart. General Stuart would not leave us blind.
Oh, one other thing. Hooker's been replaced. George Meade's the new commander. Harrison read it in the Yankee papers.
George Meade. Pennsylvania man. Meade would be cautious, I think. Take him some time to get organized. Perhaps we should move more swiftly. There may be an opportunity here.
Yes, sir.
Well...
... no reason to delay. I think we should concentrate here.
All the roads converge just east of this gap, and this junction will be very necessary.
Yes, sir.
I left my spectacles over there. What is the name of this town?
""Gettysburg.""
Very well.
Yes, sir, general. We will attack the center. But I believe you are right about the flank. Hood and McLaws were both very badly damaged yesterday. What I will do is give you two other divisions: General Pettigrew and General Trimble. They are stronger and more rested, and so you will have nearly three divisions at your command, including Pickett. Your objection will be that clump of trees yonder.
The attack will be proceeded by massed artillery. We'll concentrate all our guns on that one small area. A feu d'enfer, as Napoleon would call it. When the artillery has had its effect, your charge will break the line. You will have nearly 15,000 men at your command, general. And you may begin whenever you are ready, but plan it well. Do plan it well, I pray you, sir. We stake everything on this.
Sir with your permission... Sir, I've been a soldier all my life. I've fought from the ranks on up, you know my service. But sir, I must tell you now, I believe this attack will fail. No 15,000 men ever made could take that ridge. It's a distance of more than a mile, over open ground. When the men come out of the trees, they will be under fire from Yankee artillery from all over the field. And those are Hancock's boys! And now, they have the stone wall like we did at Fredericksburg.
We do our duty, general. We do what we must do.
Yes, sir.
Good morning, sir.
Goor morning, Major Taylor.
Will the general have some breakfast?
No, thank you.
We have flapjacks in small mountains. Fresh butter, bacon, wagons of ham, apple butter, ripe cherries. You really ought to pitch in, sir. Courtesy of our host, the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania."
General Kuribayashi,AH,Father To His Men,"I will always be in front of you.
If our children can live safely for one more day it would be worth the one more day that we defend this island.
For our homeland. Until the very last man. Our duty is to stop the enemy right here. Do not expect to return home alive.
I don't want you to kill my soldiers needlessly. Put down your sword. Put it down!
What's going on here?
These men ran from Suribachi.
Lt. Ito, I gave the order that all survivors retreat to the north caves.
I am very sorry, General. It's just... Suribachi... has fallen.
The United States is the *last* country in the world that Japan should fight.
I am determined to serve and give my life for my country.
A day will come when they will weep and pray for your souls.
You are quite a soldier
No, just a simple baker
Everything happens in threes.
You again?
We will build those underground fortifications. And fight till the end."
Lt. Commander Ron Hunter,AH,Father To His Men,"Captain Ramsey, under operating procedures governing the release of nuclear weapons, we cannot launch our missiles unless both you and I agree.
COB, what're you waiting for?
This is not a formality, sir! This is *expressly* why your command must be repeated. It requires my assent, I *do not* give it and furthermore, you continue upon this course, and insist upon this launch without confirming this message first...
Son of a bitch. As commanding officer of the U.S.S Alabama, I order you to place the XO under arrest under charges of mutiny!
I will act, backed by the rules of precedence...
I say again, as commanding officer of the U.S.S Alabama, I *order you*...
...authority in command, regulations number 815, to relieve... you... of... command, Captain!
...to place the XO under arrest, under charges of mutiny!
COB!
Captain, please, the XO is right. We can't launch unless he concurs.
""To the U.S.S. Alabama: Rebel-controlled missiles being fueled. Launch codes compromised, dissidents threaten to launch at continental United States, set DEFCON 2. Immediately launch ten Trident missile sorties."" They're *fueling their missiles*! We don't have time to fuck around!
Sir, I think you need time to think this over.
*I* don't have to think this over!
Captain, I relieve you of your command of this ship. COB, escort the Captain to his state room. I'm assuming command.
You're not assuming anything!
*Chief of the Boat*, Captain Ramsey is under arrest! Lock him in his state room!
Captain, please...
Now, COB!
In my humble opinion, in the nuclear world, the true enemy is war itself.
Speaking of horses did you ever see those Lipizzaner stallions.
What?
From Portugal. The Lipizzaner stallions. The most highly trained horses in the world. They're all white?
Yes, sir.
""Yes, sir"" you're aware they're all white or ""Yes, sir"" you've seen them?
Yes, sir I've seen them. Yes, sir I was aware that they're are all white. They are not from Portugal; they're from Spain and at birth, they're not white; they're black. Sir.
I didn't know that. But they are from Portugal.
Some of the things they do, uh, defy belief. Their training program is simplicity itself. You just stick a cattle prod up their ass and you can get a horse to deal cards.
Simple matter of voltage.
Chief of the Boat.
Sir?
Thank you, COB.
Thank you? *Fuck* you! Get it straight Mr Hunter, I'm not on your side. Now you could be wrong! But wrong or right, the Captain can't just replace you at will. That was completely improper! And that's why I did what I did. By the book.
I thank you anyway.
God help you if you're wrong.
If I'm wrong, then we're at war; God help us all.
Rivetti, what's up?
I'm sorry, Sir. It's just a difference of opinion that got out of hand.
What about?
It's really too silly to talk about, Sir. I'd really just forget about...
I don't give a damn about what you'd rather forget about. Why were you two fighting?
I said, the Kirby Silver Surfer was the only real Silver Surfer. And that the Moebius Silver Surfer was shit. And Bennefield's a big Moebius fan. And it got of hand. I pushed him. He pushed me. I lost my head, Sir. I'm Sorry.
Rivetti, you're a supervisor. You can get a commission like that.
I know, Sir. You're 100 percent right. It will never happen again.
It better not happen again. If I see this kind of nonsense again, I'm going to write you up. You understand?

Do you understand?
Yes, Sir.
You have to set an example even in the face of stupidity. Everybody who reads comic books knows that the Kirby Silver Surfer is the only true Silver Surfer. Now am I right or wrong?
You're right, Sir.
Now get out of here.
Yes, Sir.
At the Naval War College it was metallurgy and nulear reactors, not 19th-century philosophy.
""War is a continuation of politics by other means."" Von Clausewitz.
I think, sir, that what he was actually trying to say was a little more...
Complicated?
Yes the purpose of war is to serve a political end but hte true nature of war is to serve itself.
I'm very impressed. In other words, the sailor most likely to win the war is the one most willing to part company with the politicians and ignore everything except the destruction of the enemy. You'd agree with that.
I'd agree that, um, that's what Clausewitz was trying to say.
But you wouldn't agree with it?
No, sir, I do not. No, I just think that in the nuclear world the true enemy can't be destroyed.
Attention on deck. Von Clausewitz will now tell us exactly who the real enemy is.
Von?
In my humble opinion, in the nuclear world, the true enemy is war itself
We have orders in hand. Those orders are to make a pre-emptive launch. Every second that we lose increases the chances that by the time our missiles arrive, their silos could be empty because they've flown their birds and struck us first.
Yes sir.
You know as well as I do that any launch order received without authentication, is no order at all.
Yes sir.
That's our number one rule.
National mil...
And that rule is the basis for the scenario we've trained on, time and time again. It's a rule we follow without exception.
Captain, National Military Command Center knows what sector we're in. They have satellites looking down on us to see if our birds are aloft and if they're *not*, then they give our orders to somebody else. That's why we maintain more than one sub, it's what they call 'redundancy'!
I know about redundancy, Mr Hunter.
All I'm saying...
All I'm saying Captain, is that we have backup. Now it's our duty, *not* to launch until we can confirm.
You're presuming we have other submarines out there, ready to launch. Well as Captain, I must assume our submarines could've been taken out by other Akulas. We can play these games all night Mr Hunter but uh, I don't have the luxury of your presumptions.
Sir...
Mr Hunter, we have rules that are not open to interpretation, personal intuition, gut feelings, hairs on the back of your neck, little devils or angels sitting on your shoulder. We're all very well aware of what our orders are and what those orders mean. They come down from our Commander in Chief. They contain no ambiguity.
Captain...
Mr Hunter. I've made a decision. I'm Captain of this boat. NOW SHUT THE FUCK UP!
You do qualify your remarks. If someone asked me if we should bomb Japan, a simple ""Yes."" By all means sir, drop that fucker, twice! I don't mean to suggest that you're indecisive, Mr Hunter. Not at all. Just, uh... complicated. 'course, that's the way the Navy wants you. Me, they wanted simple.
Well, you certainly fooled them, sir.
Be careful there, Mr Hunter. It's all I've got to rely on, being a simple-minded son of a bitch. Rickover gave me my command, a checklist, a target and a button to push. All I gotta know is how to push it, they tell me when. They seem to want you to know why.
I would hope they'd want us all to know why, sir.
Captain, here's the results from the missile drill.
Is this the best they can do?
No sir. But, that's what they did.
I want this down to five minutes. Train on it.
Yes, sir.
Tell your buddy Weps to do it again, and keep on doing it until he gets it right.
Yes, sir.
It looks like the whole crew needs a kick in the ass.
Or a pat on the back, sir. I have witnessed a fight down in crew's mess, no big deal. It appears that the crew is a bit on edge about all we're going through. Morale seems a bit low.
May I have your attention please, crew of the Alabama, Mr. Hunter has brought it to my attention that Morale maybe a bit low. and you might be a bit...
On edge.
On edge. so, I suggest this. Any crew member who thinks that they can't handle the situation, can leave the ship right now. Gentlemen, we are at DEFCON 3, war is imminent. This the captain. That is all.
Very inspiring, sir.
Those sailors out there are just boys... boys who are training to do a terrible and unthinkable thing, and if that ever occurs the only reassurance they'll have that they're doing the proper thing is gonna derive from their unqualified belief in the unified chain of command. That means we don't question each other's motives in front of the crew. It means we don't undermine each other. It means in a missile drill, they hear your voice right after mine, without hesitation. Do you agree with that policy, sailor?
Absolutely, sir.
We're here to preserve democracy, not to practice it.
Short of the outbreak of World War Three, the ship sinking... being attacked by a giant octopus, I'd like to be undisturbed for the next thirty minutes.
I'll see to it sir.
Mr. Vossler, this is Captain Kirk! I need warp speed on that communications unit!
How do you like that cigar?
It's good, sir.
It's your first?
Yeah.
Well, don't like it too much. They're more expensive than drugs.
You repeat this order, or I'll find somebody who will!
Oh no you won't, sir.
Weps.
Weps. This is Hunter. Listen to me.
Where are you?
Don't worry about where I am. Listen, we have other ships that can handle this, you can't be influenced by the captain or anybody else, you have to make up your own mind.
Con, Weapons. Missles will be ready to launch in 4 minutes.
Listen Weps, listen Weps, don't do this. Don't do this Weps, once we launch, they cannot come back. They cannot come back Weps, and you know the repercussions if we're wrong, goddamnit. Weps, if we fire now, we'll be firing when we're blind and crippled, you understand that?
Where the fuck are you?
Do not remove the firing trigger! Do not open that safe, Weps. It's up to you, you're the only one who knows the combination it is up to YOU Weps. It's up to you.
Mind your fucking pannel!
How long's it gonna take?
I don't know, sir.
You know what's going on here?
Yes sir.
No I don't think you do. Let me explain it to you. If we launch, and we're wrong, what's left of Russia is gonna launch at us. There will be a nuclear holocaust beyond imagination, now it's all about knowing, Mr...
Vossler. We have to know whether our order to launch has been recalled or not. The only way we're gonna know, is if you fix that radio, you understand?

You ever watch Star Trek?
St- yeah, Star...
Star Trek! The USS Enterprise? All right, now you remember when the Klingons were gonna blow up the Enterprise and Captain Kirk calls down to Scotty he says ""Scotty, I gotta have more power-""
He needs more, more warp speed, yeah.
Warp speed, exactly. Now I'm Captain Kirk, you're Scotty, I need more power. I'm telling you if you do not get this radio up, a billion people are gonna die; now it's all up to you, I know it's a shitty deal but you got it, can you handle it?

Scotty?
Aye, Captain.
What if Radchenko surrendered and it's over, huh? We launch. They see us, and they launch. Our birds pass each other in the air. Boom. What have you got?
Nuclear War.
Nuclear Holocaust.
Rickover gave me my command, a checklist, a target, and a button to push. All I had to know was how to push it, and they'd tell me when. They seem to want you know why.
I would hope they'd want us all to know why, sir.
Captain? I just wanted to say thank you.
You were right, and I was wrong! About the horses, the Lippizaners. They are from Spain, not Portugal!
Yes, sir!
See you in my dreams.
Look, it wasn't a mutiny, I did everything by the book.
It's not about the book. If the Russians are gonna launch and we sit here and do nothing... who's gonna stop 'em? Half of me's glad the Captain came back.
Get the radio fixed Vossler. I could've built one by now.
Radio, X-O. Mr. Zimmer, get those communication systems back online now.
We're working on it sir.
Aye, aye, Captain.
Are we ready?
Yeah, we're ready. Go.
Oh fuck.
The system crashed, the radio buoy got severed, what the fuck does he want us to do?
Shit electrons?
Hey, we need this radio repaired. Not smart-ass remarks.
I have known Captain Ramsey for almost 30 years. We served together on more than a few occasions. If he is lying this will be the first I've heard of it.
Yes, sir.
My primary concern here is the breakdown in the system. In this instance the system failed because the two senior officers did not work to resolve their differences, while preserving the chain of command.
Now you may have been proven right, Mr Hunter, but insofar as the letter of the law is concerned, you were both right, and you were also both wrong.
This is the dilemma that will occupy this panel, this navy and this country's armed forces as a whole long after you leave this room."
Christopher Pike,AH,Father To His Men,"Gonna tell Aunt Mary about Uncle John. Claims he has a-misery but he has a lot of fun. Oh, baby. Ye-e-e-es, baby. Whoo-oo-oo-oo, baby. A-havin' me some fun tonight. Yeah. Well, Long Tall Sally, she's built sweet. She got everything that Uncle John need. Oh, baby. Ye-e-e-es, baby. Whoo-oo-oo-oo, baby. A-havin' me some fun tonight. Yeah. Well, I saw Uncle John with bald-head Sally. He saw Aunt Mary comin' and he ducked back in the alley. Oh, baby. Ye-e-e-es, baby. Whoo-oo-oo-oo, baby. Havin' me some fun tonght. Yeah. A-whoo!"
Zordon,AH,Father To His Men,"You haven't changed, Ooze. You're still picking on creatures smaller than yourself.
Oh, put a sock in it, Z. Ten minutes out of the egg, and I'm already listening to one of your lectures. You locked me up into your stuffy little hyper-lock chamber and tossed me away into the depths like yesterday's trash. Do you have any idea what it's like to be locked up in a rotten egg for 6,000 years? It's boring. Not to mention I had a Charley horse since the Renaissance.
You won't get away with this, Ooze.
You robbed me of my prime. I was the supreme ruler of the most foul empire of the universe, and now it's time to pay the piper.
The Power has been destroyed. It is gone. The Zords, the weapons, all of it. The Power Rangers are no more. Ivan Ooze has won.
Rangers, you must act swiftly, the planet is in grave danger!
Danger from what?
Six thousand years ago, a Morphological Being, known as Ivan Ooze, ruled the world with a reign of unparalleled terror. He was on the verge of completing construction of his ultimate weapons, The Ectomorphicon Titans, twin machines capable of enslaving the entire universe.
What happened to him?
A group of young warriors, like yourselves, lured him into a hyper-lock chamber and buried him deep underground; but now the chamber has been accidentally uncovered, you must return it to the depths, before it is opened and Ivan is released.
His Ectomorphicons were buried near the chamber, if Ivan escapes, he's sure to find them.
Use extreme caution Rangers, you are dealing with an evil here that is beyond all imagination.
Alpha, my sensors tell me the Rangers were too late. Ivan is on his way here.
Don't worry. Nobody enters the command center without a Power Coin.
Well, almost nobody.
Hi folks, Ivan Ooze here. Are you bored with your job? Are you bored with your life? Then come on down to Ooze City, and let's get STICKY!
Ayiyiyiyi!
Ivan's evil plot has taken shape. I just hope they're not too late."
Wolfstan,AH,Father To His Men,"The fumes of the dead are in the air like poison. The plague, more cruel and more pitiless than war, descended upon us. A pestilence, that would leave half of our kingdom dead. Where did it come from? What carried its germ. The priests told us it was God's punishment. For what sin? What commandment must we break that could earn this? No, we knew the truth. This was not God's work, but devilry. Or witchcraft. But our task, to hunt down a demon, was God's cure.
I like to think that he found peace. That he continued seeing beauty in the world. Goodness.
Look after him.
There's no need. He's back with God.
If this is Hell, I can't wait for Heaven.
Believe me, Swire, you're not bound for Heaven."
Major Henry West,AH,Father To His Men,"This is what I've seen in the four weeks since infection. People killing people, which is much what I saw in the four weeks before infection, and the four weeks before that, and before that, and as far back as I care to remember. People killing people, which to my mind, puts us in a state of normality right now.
I promised them women.
What?
Eight days ago I found Jones with his gun in his mouth. He said he was going to kill himself, because there was no future. What could I say to him? We fight off the infected or we wait until they starve to death, and then what? What do nine men do, except wait to die themselves? I moved us from the blockade. I set the radio broadcasting, and I promised them women... because women mean a future.
Have you met our new age Sergeant?
Tell me, Farrell, why exactly did you join the army?
I don't want to eat.
You must eat, Hannah.
I don't want to eat. I want to bury my dad. He's one of the people you're talking about.
You killed all my boys.
Wait.
Salvation is here. The answer to infection is here. If you can hear this, you're not alone. There are others like you. There are others like you. There are other survivors. We are soldiers, and we are armed. And we can protect you. Our location is the 42nd blockade in the M-602, twenty-seven miles northeast of Manchester. You must find us. Salvation is here.
And lastly, meet Mailer.
Mailer, Jim. Jim, Mailer. Got infected two days ago. Mitchell managed to knock him out cold, and we got a chain around his neck.
You're keeping him alive?
The idea was to learn something about infection. Have him teach me.
And is he?
In a way. He's telling me he'll never bake bread, farm crops, raise livestock. He's telling me he's futureless. And eventually he'll tell me how long the infected take to starve to death.
Since it began, who have you killed? You wouldn't be alive now, if you hadn't killed somebody.
I want to give you a chance. You could be with us, but I can't let them go.
Okay, Jim. Okay.
Him, too."
