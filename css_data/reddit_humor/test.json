So naturally it\u2019s very difficult for the frog to make friends with the other frogs and he ends up with just one friend; a tortoise who\u2019s had the patience and the wherewithal to befriend this mute frog and to develop a system of communication with him. Basically the frog blinks once for Yes, twice for No, the tortoise does all the talking and asks all the questions and they get along just fine. Years go by and the frog and the tortoise have fostered a beautiful friendship. But as the frog has gotten older he has become sexually curious and desires to mingle with the other frogs his age. The tortoise senses this one day and asks the frog, \u2018do you want me to take you to the pond?\u2019 The frog blinks once for Yes. So the tortoise takes the frog to the pond and starts introducing him to all the other frogs. At first the frog is very nervous but the tortoise does a great job of explaining his disability and all the other frogs are very accepting of his condition. The mute frog ends up making a lot of new friends which boosts his confidence. And then the frog spies across the pond a beautiful girl frog. He can\u2019t take his eyes off of her and the tortoise catches him staring. The tortoise says, \u2018You like her, don\u2019t you?\u2019 The frog blinks once. The tortoise says, \u2018You want me to go talk to her for you?\u2019 The frog blinks twice for No. \u2018I see,\u2019 says the tortoise. \u2018You wish you could talk to her yourself.\u2019 The frog blinks once, a single tear rolling down his little frog cheek. \u2018Well gee, my friend,\u2019 says the tortoise. \u2018We\u2019ve been good friends for so long, I think I owe it to you to find a way to restore your voice.\u2019 And with that the tortoise sets out.The tortoise searches all over the forest for days until one day he meets a snake who just so happened to be the most renowned surgeon of all the land. This snake could perform any surgery that exists.  The tortoise explains the situation to the snake and asks him if there\u2019s anything the snake can do for the frog.\u2018Yessssss,\u2019 the snake replies. \u2018There issss one sssurgery I can perform that may ressstore your friend\u2019sss voice, but you have to undersssstand, it\u2019s very risssky. There\u2019sss a fifty percent chance your friend won\u2019t sssurvive the sssurgery.\u2019 \u2018Oh my,\u2019 says the tortoise. \u2018I\u2019ll be sure to let him know!\u2019 So the tortoise returns to the frog and tells him the news. \u2018There\u2019s this snake who might be able to restore your voice, but it\u2019s a coin toss whether or not you survive the procedure. Do you want to go through with this?\u2019 After a long pause, the frog blinks once for Yes. So a day is set aside for the surgery and on that day all of the creatures of the forest gather around the snake and the frog as the snake prepares his tools and the anesthesia starts to kick in.
