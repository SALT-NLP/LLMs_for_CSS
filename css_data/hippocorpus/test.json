excited for our son to have a sibling.\nC: However, when we told our son the news he was not happy about it.\nD: We found out I was pregnant with a girl and we thought it might make it feel more real

she once joined an old fashioned cattle drive that took a herd of livestock from idaho to montana by horse.\nF: She was so taken by the series and it's characters that she even had her bicep tattooed with a full half-sleeve of McCrae rearing back on a horse.\nG: It was quite good work and I was quite jealous.\nH: I wouldn't mind going back to visit some of the timeless characters in those novels, they really do hold up in their unflinching depiction of the old american west, blemishes and all.\nI: Some of the most profound things I took from the stories were the details surrounding the cultures of the various native american tribes the cowboys encounter along the journeys.\nJ: It's very interesting to know how the comanches and apaches were so desperately feared, and some other tribes simply were not as their way of life was much different.\nK: It also doesn't surprise me that plains native americans would be so tough and willing to fight to defend themselves given the overall harsh environment of north and west texas.\nL: One of the most striking moments in the series is when the long time adversary of Call and McCrae, the former chief of the comanches, is on his death-bed and seeks a personal journey to die alone and apart from his tribe.\nM: The cowboys have fought him for decades and want nothing but vengeance but they never get it.\nN: Instead the reader is treated to a profound moment of acceptance from an incredibly strong-willed man as he ushers himself from his world.\nO: It is truly one of my favorite books and having grown up in Texas, I some sense of pride imagining that events as romantic if at time brutal  probably took place.\nP: It makes me feel at the very least that Texas is as unique a state as we Texans would like to believe and often proclaim.","116":"A: 4 months ago i kept my baby boy seated on the floor of my living room, playing with his toys, i removed my eyes from him for about 2 minutes cause i need to reply tomy messages online.\nB: after about 2 minute i had to lift my eyes to look at him to my greatest surprised he crawled away from where i kept him to a little space in front of him.\nC: i was so amazed and surprised.\nD: when this happened some thought came to my mind, that my baby could now begin to crawl.\nE: this means this reduced his reliance on me for carrying him around always.\nF: my baby will definitely entertain himself crawling on the floor, picking up his toys and from ther he will be able to stand holding something and before i know he will take his first step.\nG: so i felt a great sigh of relief and i was so happy and proud of him.\nH: Although, There are a number of critical breakthroughs that your infant will reach early in life.\nI: From straightforward assignments like sitting up or lifting their head to more progressed developments like rolling over, these small accomplishments are continuously inspiring.\nJ: But there\u2019s nothing very like seeing your baby crawling for the primary time.\nK: Many guardians are on edge to see their child crawl and closely screen their baby\u2019s improvements.\nL: Of course, there\u2019s completely nothing off-base with that! In any case, it\u2019s vital to keep in mind that all babies are diverse and take after a distinctive advancement path.\nM: Most babies begin to crawl somewhere between 6 and 10 months of age.\nN: my

made to go boxes of left over food for everyone and then cleaned up the kitchen.\nN: One of my cousins was a photographer and we went outside and took a lot of outdoor pictures of everyone and later he put them online for us.\nO: It was good to see everyone and it felt like when we were all kids and were at our grandparents house eating her food and seeing each other, like at Christmas or Thanksgiving.\nP:  Most of them brought the food that grandma made when we were growing up so that made it feel even more like a family reunion .\nQ:  It was a fun day and sad also when my dad gave a little speech at the end and said how proud he was of all of us.\nR: He teared up some and I think everyone else did too.\nS: It was sad because everyone has to die and we aren't here for very long.\nT: It made us aware of that I think and it was sad but also fun to see everyone.\nU:  We made plans to see each other again in September and I am looking forward to that .\nV: Some of them have

that said that these pills might cure me and get me back to normal.\nI: But it didn't.\nJ: I took them and turned my pee to a blue color, which on the package, it said that it was normal.\nK: But it didn't cure my frequent urination, which is what i'm going through right now.\nL: I wish the health care industry in america would be a lot more efficient and not have someone that is poor and not a lot of money have them wait an eternity for treatment.\nM: But, i am going to see him tomorrow, that is what is important.\nN: What the urinary specialist told me was they're going to ultra sound my kidneys.\nO: Then they're going to look inside my urine hole while i'm under anesthesia.\nP: I'm hoping this will end good, not bad.\nQ: Hope for a speedy recovery, so i can go back to work like i

Too busy with chores that never end to spend precious time with loved ones?  Too busy to spend time praying, or doing worthwhile hobbies that I enjoy?

taxable.\nH: So I made plans to see an accountant and file for back taxes.\nI: According to my research on Google the IRS was required to allow installment payments I could afford, but I was still

got promoted in July.\nF: It really came to a surprise to me that I got the promotion so early.\nG: I suppose it was because they really enjoy my line of work and love that I am work-driven and know how to complete tasks in a timely fashion and can be consistent and meet deadlines.\nH: At least, I hope that is why they decided to give the promotion to me as early as they did.\nI: I am very pleased with my work ethic, I enjoy this company a lot and think that I can bring new and fresh ideas to this company as well as be a great manager.\nJ: I just didn't think that it would happen

people truly do care about each other.\nJ: Even she wept at seeing how it made them feel.\tI couldn\u2019t thank my daughter enough for reminding me of this lesson, something so simple that I truly forgot it.\nK: It took the little bit of compassion from a teenager to remind me why I do these kinds of things.\nL: And they say teenagers only care about themselves\u2026 She\u2019s a good egg.","221":"A: The memorable event that I shared was when my step-father got in touch with me after a long time of us not speaking to each other.\nB: My biological dad left when I was a baby so my step-dad was pretty much the sole father figure in my life during some of my formative years (around age four to nine).\nC: This was until he and my mom unfortunately got divorced.\nD: He still tried to be there for me but life got in the way.\nE: He and I drifted apart over time.\nF: So my step-dad apparently got my phone number from my mom and gave me an unexpected call one day several months ago.\nG: I said how good it was to hear from him, and we updated each other on some of the new mundane things in our lives.\nH: He also told me about his health, which he's had issues with at times, but on the whole things are going pretty well for him especially considering he's in his 70s.\nI: I shared news about my own health which has also had some bumps in the road.\nJ: He told me he has a new wife who he said is great and he's very happy being with.\nK: The memorable and rather shocking part of the story was when that my step-dad told me his younger sister had died (only in her 50s) far too soon from cancer.\nL: I was really quite sad and taken aback by this.\nM: It brought up a lot of memories from my childhood of staying over at her house and how nice she was.\nN: I of course tried my best to offer my condolences and sympathy.\nO: It was a nice conversation and moving experience that lasted about half an hour.\nP: At the end of the call we expressed intent to stay in touch, which we have.\nQ: It's been good to have him back in my life even in just a small way.","222":"A: Today was the day!

worried about how her brother is going to handle having a baby in the house.\nH:  He didn't seem to be too happy when he met her.\nI:  It could be because I'm not home too, change is always hard for a
