3A4TN5196L4AN0WHD1ZU2K08B7QCHF,1,"Four months ago, I had a big family reunion. We haven't had one in over 20 years. This was a very exciting event. I saw my Grandma who said I liked great as ever. I saw my Grandpa who said I was getting strong. My Aunt looked lovely and thanked me for the compliment. My Uncle still smoked a lot. We had a nice feast. There were plenty of steaks to go around the whole family. There were some nice mashed potatoes to eat. They had gravy on the side. There was a big cake to share with everybody. It was a chocolate cake. There was also horseshoes to play. I barely beat my Uncle. We vowed to keep in touch.",I met up with my family for a big reunion for the first time in 20+ years.

3Q8GYXHFEQOY77CMCZYLDNXI6SXC5K,2,We had a family reunion about 4 months ago that was a really great time. I got to see my distant family that I hadn't seen in decades since I was a kid and close ones that I rarely see. It was cool to see my grandpa because It's honestly been at least 25 years and since he is handicap it's hard for him to get around. He also lives on the opposite coast so it is just hard to meet up. He was looking in pretty good health about the same as when he left so that was good to see considering all the time that has passed. My grandma was there too I had my issues in the past with her but it was still nice to see her. She treated my mom poorly so we don't talk much but I put aside my issues just for this small time period to make the gathering go smooth. I got to see my favorite aunt and uncle who both shared similar passions to me with computers and tech stuff and it's been like 20 years since I saw them so that was sweet. Basically they are the same as I remember just older but they are just as into tech stuff as they were back then. I remember I would bring my GameBoy or old PC games over to their house and they would know about them or have them themselves. Just really good memories honesty that I was happy to remember with how stressful life has been. Finally I got to just catch up with some other family members like my cousins and some others who I didn't remember as well cause I was so young back then. This might have been the last time a lot of us get to meet because we all live so far apart and aren't exactly wealthy so we tried to make the most of it. We took a lot of pictures and overall had a great time and we pledged to try and talk over the phone/webcam more often. I hope everyone gets to meet up with their family at some point because in the end it's all that you have and you don't want to waste that.,I met up with my family for a big reunion for the first time in 20+ years.

3RXCAC0YISBUB1BTCJ17FYSOD6EG8N,3,It was our first ever family reunion and it was really cool. We weren't able to really do this before besides random holiday meet ups sporadically so it really was a nice change of pace. We got to really spend some time together that wasn't rushed and catch up on at least a decade worth of misc stuff. It was surprising how much fun it was because I always had memories of being bored out of my mind. I guess when you're a kid/teen you would rather be doing other stuff but now that I'm an adult I understood the value of it. I wish I could go back in time and tell myself not to squander these moments as we never know if they will be the last. Some of my family had passed away in the time frame from when we last met up for the holidays and the reunion so I won't ever get to spend time with them again and that sucks. It was really good to see my aunt and uncle again as they are the most similar to myself with our love for technology and in general relaxed personalities. I wish I had connected with them much sooner but when my parents divorced people kind of took sides and it was hard to reach over the divide. I won't make that mistake again I want to keep these relationships going so we did promise to keep in weekly or bi weekly contact. We are all in general bad at communication so hopefully we can keep this up and I will try to take control of it being the youngest. I guess personally I am at fault for the divide when it comes to this family. I should've been the one to really reconnect us years ago but I was just generally absorbed in the grind of life and my immediate friends/family that I didn't try. I will look at my relationships with my distant family and friends more so we stay more connected. It was great to write about this again because I feel like this is a different view from the last time since I have been chatting with my family more since the last time I did this.,I met up with my family for a big reunion for the first time in 20+ years.

I always love to observe art on the streets or in museums but 3 weeks ago I got to have a very cool art experience. Many neighbors came together to paint a mural in the middle of the intersection. It was my first time to pain on a street and the first time to paint a ten foot manatee. We chose the manatee because it is the elementary school's mascot. It was also a great way to get the kids involved. I learned about how to paint on the street and make sure it isn't easily washed out. This was a really great experience for me because I paint often. I am no master artist or anything but I think this experience has given me a huge burst of inspiration. I do not think I will start creating graffiti or anything but I might start using different tools. My choice paint is watercolor because of how delicate it is and soft and beautiful the strokes come out. It takes patience because what appears when you paint, and what comes out when it dries are two different images. What I love about painting the street is that it is easy to just make corrections immediately without having to wait much. This was a great experience that opened my eyes to new things. I think I may try using acrylics next time I am in front of the canvas.",Public art is fun and makes the neighborhood proud.

3NG53N1RLW50OE4SF2RU976G74VP81,1,"It was a hot day in July that our community decided to paint a mural on an intersection for public art. I had decided to volunteer to help paint. I signed up for the morning shift and arrived a bit early.  They had started to paint the street with primer for where the design would be painted. While I waited for that to be finished, I signed in so that the city could keep track of the amount of volunteer hours that everyone preformed. I then was instructed to have some of the donuts and water that had been brought. As I ate my donut, I noticed a couple chickens crossing the road. I was told that they lived on the block. I went back to get my camera and take a few pictures of the chickens and the beginning of the artwork. I finished taking the pictures and they were ready for me to start helping. I found a paint roller and chose to start with painting the yellow rays of sunlight. It took a couple hours but it looked great. I had wanted to paint a part of the mural that I could come back and say, I did that. I decided to paint the manatee. It had already been drawn so I got the grey paint mixed and started to paint it. A young girl, who was visiting the neighborhood, asked to help paint. I directed her to where there were more paint brushes and she soon came back. It was a fun time painting the manatee. The outline of the manatee looked really bad at this point, so I got some black paint and went over the entire outline having to change some of what we had previously painted. When I was finished with the outline, it looked great and everyone was really happy with it. I then took a picture of it and went home happily knowing that there was a manatee painted on that street by me.",Public art is fun and makes the neighborhood proud.

They had already started to paint the base coat of white on the street. It was my time to help paint. I choose to help paint the sun beams. The sun was starting to come up and it was going to be a very hot day but the fun of painting in the street helped to make you forget all of that.

When I was finally ready to give her a chance that went all the way left. I asked her how did I get burned why do i have what looks like cigarette marks on my body ?

How could she deny me the information because God forgave her. I wanted to scream What about me the person who all this crap happened too? But I didn't I just didn't say anything.

3LBXNTKX0SH5BSPT6L7P3GNVPHCX9Q,1,"Three months ago I lost a job that paid minimum wage. It was barely enough income to get by on and not enough for my budget to include savings. That's how I found myself homeless. Within a matter of a few months, I was consigned to wander through the streets that used to be mine. I now sleep in the same park where once I stood looking lovingly at the green earth, the trees, the birds sweetly fluttering. That park is now a place to hide away from the rest of the world, so like a leper. It seems just yesterday that I'd belonged with those people who come for the fresh open space.  My eyes now  follow their peaceful smiles, their kids full of crisp laughter as they casually walk about the grounds. They're spending a pleasant holiday hours just seizing a chance to drift and dream. That's very different than being me who is now a drifter who never dreams anymore.  Much of the time I stay huddled far back into the rich foliage, under old blankets and plastic. I've ceased dreaming and now know only the nightmare of little to no food, warmth, or affection, and all I can feel is fear. I don't understand why this happened to me. I didn't do anything wrong; I just lost my job. Several losses followed-- my apartment, belongings, my pets, even my friends.

3MHW492WW1ZSEN3SVFACKHWTMTNVMJ,3,"I recently came to the realization that most of what I believed in life was a lie. No one ""lied"" to me, but the American Dream, at least for myself, was filled with untruths. The idea, of course, if that if you go to college, get married, have kids, buy a house...etc, that you will experience a life full of joy. A short time ago though I realized that this was not the life for me. Of course I realized this too late. I already have a wife, kids, house and lots of college debt. I now spend my days working to pay interest to the same people who probably made up the story on how to be happy. So, in need of some relief, I traveled to south Florida to see an old friend. We talked - for hours - about the true meaning of life, its purpose, and what to do when you are unhappy. Some people say that if you are not happy in life, change it. Find another job. Move. However, if you are already in the society trap of the American Dream, escape is not so easy. Well, at least not if you have a conscious. There is a scene in the movie ""Office Space"" that really strikes home. In a moment of clarity, Peter, the main character, tell his psychologist that each day he wakes up is the worst day of his life. I feel him. My memorable event was not something that happened ""to me,"" but an awakening inside me.

Megan and I went to college together and lived in the same apartment complex for three years. We have always been close but never really spoke of being interested in each other romantically. It's funny but we just never seemed to be single at the same time.

It was then that a light bulb seemed to go off in both of our heads. Our other friend ended up leaving early so we just chatted all night and eventually went home together. We hit it off perfectly. We have always had great chemistry together and shared many interests, so it made sense. We also appeared to be very much attracted to each other. This only happened a month ago, but we still have yet to inform some of our good friends. Most of them will think we are crazy too.

37XITHEISXVNCUAK96BOGO2EWJ4RCB,3,"Dear Diary, today I've been doing a lot of thinking about my cousin's wedding. It was such a beautiful day, and I was & still am so happy that she found her person. But I can't help but feel a bit of residual stress as I think over how I almost ruined it for her. Maybe that's dramatic, but I felt like I was ruining things when I spilled my champagne down the front of my bridesmaid's gown when she was counting on me to just show up and be presentable. Of course,  she wasn't mad at me in the end (maybe that's because we got it cleaned up), but the stress and embarrassment I felt was crazy. I haven't been to many big events like that lately, and I was freaking out. As if standing up in front of all those people wasn't enough pressure. Now, I thought, I'd have to either do it with a giant wet stain down my front, or change and be the only person in the wedding party wearing old, ripped jeans. I even thought, for a moment, about just sitting the whole thing out. But of course, that would've also ruined it because of how we'd rehearsed everything and I had to walk with a groomsman. Luckily, our wonderful grandma made it to the wedding that day. Leave it to an old-timer to know all the secret tricks for getting stains out. It took her no time at all to make my dress good as new, and the weight just instantly lifted off my chest. I know it's probably not as big of a deal as I make it out to be, but I've always been prone to anxiety. My cousin is so important to me and I just couldn't stand the thought of ruining her big day. She's waited so long for it. Thankfully, it all went according to plan and she's got perfect, champagne-stain-free photos to look back on and remember forever. I'm so happy it all worked out in the end.","Four months ago, my cousin got married and I was a bridesmaid.

The wedding itself was just a small family affair that happened at the court house with a celebration afterwards.  She wanted it like that and I was fine with it too.  It was less planning and fanfare which is more her style.  One of the best things about this wedding is that my son came and he and my daughter got to be reunited with each other.  They've been arguing and hostile with each other for the past five years so this was kinda a big deal.  I was so glad to see them finally reconcile with each other because it's been a huge strain for me having them fighting with each other.  It makes it hard because neither will come to family get togethers like Christmas if they know the other is there and this makes me so sad.  I want the whole family together and it's just not the same if one is not there.  So this was a big deal to me and made the wedding all the more meaningful.  I didn't know that my son was going to come and actually I expected him not to, so I was really surprised when he showed up.  I saw him talking to my daughter later that night at our house and I expected it to get heated but to my surprise they were laughing and smiling.

It turns out that my father was awarded settlements from a lawsuit at the time of his death. As the executor of his estate the funds went to me. I was floored. The 12 checks were made out to me and had my father as reference. I immediately called the law firm and was explained that I had already signed the release and they had all that they needed.

I was a bit out of shape, so some of the trails were difficult, but I felt happy once I completed them. My favorite walks on the trail were the paths that lead to waterfalls and hanging gardens. There were beautiful rock formations, and amazing plant life. Also, the bus ride up to the trails was fascinating, especially seeing the variety of different locations. After our days in the park, we headed into town to check out the shops. A lot of the shops were rock and mineral shops. There were some nice rocks, but I didn't end up purchasing any.

Without warning, there were times I was hit with the sudden urge to pee and ended up holding it too long.  I knew that I probably had an infection, and I did.  I remember while I was waiting in the office thing that with my luck, it was quite possible that I would just wet my pants right there and then.  Holding my pee had become a regular habit for me.  It all started six months prior when I saw a family friend that I hadn't seen in awhile.  As soon as I saw him, my heart started pounding.  My stomach dropped to the floor and, of course, I had to pee right away.  All of the bad memories assaulted my mind in a matter of seconds.  The way he had sexually assaulted me those many years ago.  All of a sudden, it seemed like it had happened just seconds before.  So that was the day that holding my pee became a problem.  I wet myself and left in quite a hurry.  It was positively humiliating to me but I'm pretty sure no one else noticed because I left so quickly.  So now, it's a common problem.  I never know when it's going to hit me, but as soon as the flashbacks happen, the urge to pee always follows and I feel frozen in place trying to hold my pee.  I thought maybe it would stop after a few times but it seems to be going strong 6 months later and I'm at my wits end as to what to do.

Then it took like a week to hear back from the people who schedule appointments at the hospital. It was a matter of me going to hospital to see why they hadn't called me, when my primary doctor said that someone from the hospital would. It took weeks to see a urinary specialist. I don't know the exact length, but i had to wait a couple of weeks just so he can hear my side of the story and see what steps he can take with me. I went to my first visit with the urinary specialist on July 27, now i'm going back to see him tomorrow (August 27, 2019). After my first visit with the urine specialist, he gave me a 2 week supply of blue/purple pills that said that these pills might cure me and get me back to normal. But it didn't. I took them and turned my pee to a blue color, which on the package, it said that it was normal. But it didn't cure my frequent urination, which is what i'm going through right now. I wish the health care industry in america would be a lot more efficient and not have someone that is poor and not a lot of money have them wait an eternity for treatment. But, i am going to see him tomorrow, that is what is important. What the urinary specialist told me was they're going to ultra sound my kidneys. Then they're going to look inside my urine hole while i'm under anesthesia. I'm hoping this will end good, not bad. Hope for a speedy recovery, so i can go back to work like i used to 2 years ago.","I held on to my pee, longer than i should have.

Our next park was Carowinds, just outside Charlotte North Carolina. We were there long enough for a day in the park and the city. After this, we went to Kings Dominion in Doswell Virginia. They have a coaster that pulls so many G's everyone blacks out or gets close to it. After a day here, we visited Philadelphia. We spent a night and day in the city. We toured around the sites and ate plenty of Cheesesteaks and Dinic's roasted pork sandwiches. Our final stop was Toronto and Canada's Wonderland just outside the city. We spent three days. This was we made sure to take in as much as the city had to offer. We also stopped on the way there to see Niagara Falls. I had never seen it from the Canadian side.

Prior to the honeymoon I had some very important work due, and I was really looking forward to the time to have fun. We both love theme parks, and so our honeymoon was to visit six new theme parks. We started at Holiday World in Indiana. They had amazing roller coasters, including one named Voyage, that is now in my top five of all time. They also had tons of great water rides. After that, we went to Kentucky Kingdom. It was a small park, but had some nice coasters. Unfortunately, it was 100 degrees and humid, and for some reason the water park wasn't open. Because of this, we left really early to get to our next destination, Dollywood. Sadly, we had to cancel the visit to Dollywood because of a huge storm. Instead, we continued on to Carowinds, and got to ride Fury 325, which is now my second favorite coaster. We spent two days in Charlotte, where Carowinds is, and then headed to Virginia to go to Kings Dominion. The park was amazing. We both loved intimidator 305 and Twisted Timbers. After this, we headed to Philadelphia to enjoy the city itself, with no theme parks. Our final stop was in Toronto, where we enjoyed the city, and a great theme park, called Canada's Wonderland.

3TUI152ZZC93DQLMGUX4U29JU16Q1G,2,"Three weeks ago, my life changed for the better.  I came face-to-face with how I was truly missing out on life, on what matters most.  Unlike some people that realize too late they missed time with a loved one, I get to start over now.  The day started like any other day.  I mindlessly went through my routine, made sure my spouse was ready for work, and dropped my kid off at school.  Nothing different happened that morning or during that day.  Like normal, I just did my job, made some money, ran errands, cleaned the house, and started some things for dinner.  I had coffee with my friend, chatting about our many responsibilities and how grateful we were for any breaks from spending time with others, how heavy our workloads were and how school gave us a little break in our day from childcare. That afternoon, I went to go pick up my kid from school.  I ended up driving behind that same friend, who had kids in the same school.  There was a school bus stopped along the rode, which was a rural highway.  I saw it and slowed down, but my friend in front of my didn't see it.  She ran right over children who were getting off the bus.  The kids were killed in that horrible accident.  My friend couldn't even offer condolences; she was just saying how busy she was and that she didn't see.  She was too busy to see the bus stopped, too busy to see the precious lives in front of her...too busy...too busy.  I picked up my kid and went home, too moved to eat dinner that night.  I could have been that woman: too busy to see; too busy with what?  Too busy with chores that never end to spend precious time with loved ones?  Too busy to spend time praying, or doing worthwhile hobbies that I enjoy?  Am I too busy to pass those hobbies, those precious moments and memories on to my kids?  I realized that I had been going through life numb, as if on auto-pilot, just checking off tasks on a list.  All the while, the things that truly matter were passing me by.  I hugged my spouse and child close, and determined that I would no longer miss what's important in life.

38YMOXR4MVL349I5Y98RHNIL33P6WB,1,"Life happens so quickly that sometimes you don't realize how much of it has passed. You just wake up each day and go through the same routine as though you're on auto pilot. You wake the kids, walk the dog and go to work then the next thing you know the work day is over then it's back home to get ready for bed and start the cycle all over again. Days turn into weeks and weeks into months and you wonder where the time went while waiting to reach this destination of happiness you've been longing to find for as long as you can remember. Recently, in one of those brief moments of wonder and longing I did more than reminisce over time and it's elusive passing. I decided that I was tired of the same thing every day and tired of the waiting for something more when it's not possible to know how much time you have left. I keep waiting for this happiness like it's a destination when I had to remind myself that being happy is a mood. Sometimes it's brief and sometimes it's replaced by sadness, bitterness, or anger. I reminded myself it was time to actually live my life and that meant having more of these happy moments so I decided to get off of auto pilot and truly live. I had been at the same job for almost 7 1/2 years and it has been a great place to work, but felt stuck in a job I just had to go to because I felt it was my only option. I had found  extra work in an online platform and it was nice to have extra income in times when I needed it. I started to think about my job and how I had to miss out on things with my kids because of work and I decided to just quit. Out of the blue, I just quit my job after 7 1/2 years and decided I was going to support myself and my children by committing to work full time online so I would be a single stay at home mom. After I actually done this I felt empowered but by the next day I felt terrified because I had devoted 7 1/2 years to a job I had planned to retire from. I questioned myself and then realized, this chapter was officially over. I had taken the kids to school and it was time for me to get online and work. This was almost 3 weeks ago. It has been a struggle so far and I'm learning how to navigate my time when it comes to working online, but it's been rewarding. This destination of happiness, while I realized it's a mood and not so much a destination, I have spent much more time feeling it. I've not only been able to take my kids to school, but I've actually been able to watch my 14 year old son's soccer games and haven't missed a baseball practice for my younger son and we've spent more time hiking and going to the dog park. I know it won't be easy but I am tired of living on auto pilot. For the first time in as long as I can even remember I'm happy and that's an incredible feeling. I hope to find more work online because I need more income soon, but I feel as though things will work out for the best. Sometimes you have to choose yourself and actually live.

Now, that I finally see what I've been doing I know what I have to change. It means no more living on auto pilot and loving the same way. I realize how I need to take the extra time to show my kids how much I love them and not just expect them to just know. I realize I need to change up the monotonous everyday and show them by actually saying it more out loud and not expecting them to know because I do the standard things everyday that they've come to expect of me. Everyone needs to truly feel and understand that they're loved which I've realized can't be done on the same monotonous auto pilot mode. It's time to go outside of the norm and truly show it. I have literally changed my everyday life from a simple realization. By actually showing my love and speaking my truth it has made not only my children much happier and more willing to talk openly to me about what's going on in their lives, but it's also made me so much happier. Living on auto pilot happens way to often and I feel like I can't be the only one in the same boat. I feel like my advice when talking with friends and family has really had a positive impact on them as well.

It's always been stressful yet rewarding for me over the thousands of hours I have played in this game but my last week's game stands out than the rest. I picked Crystal Maiden as my hero and I went with another person who played a carry Slark at the bottom lane. My lane partner was very vocal on the team chat on how I am very inefficient and was stealing his experience points in the game. He did say something about how ""noob"" I am and grew more and more frustrated minute by minute. He was killed multiple times in the early game and of course, I was blamed for it. I did not let his words be a distraction nor a way to just give up and surrender. Even though I had a mic, I stayed quiet and just typed ""I'm sorry"" on chat whenever he screamed at me. Our towers are down but I kept optimistic on winning. Even though he was being angry at me and whenever I made I mistake I get bullied by him, he also never gave up and continued gaining experience and gold necessary for his hero to be powerful. The first time the enemy made a mistake and we won a team fight, I immediately congratulated our team for the great play and my other teammates were all audibly optimistic as well. Our carry Slark at this point has considerably limited his verbal abuse and I was sure that he will cooperate once he realized we were all there to win the game. The enemy had many more mistakes after that and we had a very satisfying comeback. I would always commend and rate positively my teammates whenever I win, so I did it as well with Slark. I was surprised that he did commend me back and got a friend request from him after the game. I did accept his friend requests and we've been playing a few more games to this day. I actually quite like his company and we enjoy our in-game banter and he actually jokes a lot with me now.","This is a story about a strong, young lad who handled a poor situation with dignity and honor.

3PQMUDRV7SS1WYT1BTD1DZZIUP6II3,2,"Two days ago my son was harassed at football practice by some of his teammates.  He is an incredibly good player, good student, and is well-liked.  However, some kids have taken affront to the fact that he is an all around good kid and good guy.  They are jealous of his popularity and his alleged perfection.   Before practice 4 kids circled him up and pushed him around while taunting him with emotionally scarring words that effected his game play during practice.  He didn't want to turn the kids in because he felt that that would cause more problems, but he did choose to share his concerns with me -as a way to vent.  He and I went for a long run to get it out of our systems.   I couldn't sleep that night, I was angry at the kids and upset for my son.  Even though he said he was ok, I knew that he wasn't and I could see the hurt and frustration in his eyes.  The next day, I called the coach and took it upon myself to report the situation.  He was surprised because everyone likes my son, and was concerned that he opted not to say anything to him about it.  The coach wound up looking at the security footage from the field for that day, and though he couldn't hear what was being said, he was able to determine who it was, and what was happening.  He showed the whole team the footage at practice the next day.   The entire team -except those kids of course - voted to have the brats kicked off the team for bullying and harassment.  They were also suspended from school for their behavior.

3GNCZX450J9E72X7C0B85YCCTW6PAM,3,"My son, we will call him Sam, decided to play football.  Now, Sam is a bit on the husky side, but that is truly his only downfall.  He is incredibly smart and gives all tasks his all.  He is super friendly, and kind of Ferdinand in that he doesn't like using his size to hurt others.  He also is home schooled, because as a parent, I am worried about bullying and the other social factors that cause students to become sidetracked from their studies and lead to emotional problems.  In any event, when Sam began playing football, he began with a group of kids that already had been playing together for years and also went to school together and lived in the same neighborhood.  He had made some friends, but this core group of kids was hard to crack - especially since Sam had no previous football experience AND the coaches were all father's of this golden crew. Sam was having an especially tough practice, and was confused about the instruction of a particular play - and finally angry because on day 7 Sam didn't know what in the heck a touch back, left tackle was or the different rules that apply to offense and defense yet.  The coaches son said some incredibly hateful things to Sam behind his back, but loudly enough  so that Sam could hear.  He was crying and so upset when all of those kids laughed and picked on him all practice.  I briefly spoke to the coach who did NOTHING but say it was FOOTBALL and to toughen up.  I talked to Sam, and he decided to stay.  He seemed a little off that day, but worked hard and had all the plays figured out as he had studied up the night before.  When it came time to scrimmage the other 3rd and 4th grade team, they SHOULD have demolished them,  but since Sam was a left tackle and his job was to protect the punk that had been treating him like crap - he decided to literally, and VERY obviously step aside and allowed the 150 lb beast of a defensive linebacker attack the little jerk.  After taking a couple of hits, Nate, the snot nosed coach's son, started hollering at Sam to do his job.  Sam called a time out and very loudly said, ""I tell you what, Nate.  I'll make you a deal - you stop talking smack about me and treating me like dirt, and I will do my job.  Does it seem really smart to be mean to the one person protecting you from a monster sized kid with death in his eyes?  Do you think it makes sense to piss off someone twice your size?  So what do you think?  Are you ready to be nice, or do I need to keep leaving a hole?""  The whole field was silent - and the kid was so red.  His mother gasped.

We bought a house together (luckily I put that in my name only), adopted a dog together and I was starting to plan out our future.

32UTUBMZ7HIWVWZV4QK361LZ7B2VB8,3,"I've read the full four book lonesome dove series and I consider it to be among the finest of the great western classics. I've also seen the numerous depictions in film of McMurtry's stories. I first discovered the adventures of Call and McCrae in my freshman year of high school. My new girlfriend at the time (who considered herself a bit of a cowgirl) was obsessed with the series. She wasn't exaggerating to say she'd tried her hand at being a cowboy; she once joined an old fashioned cattle drive that took a herd of livestock from idaho to montana by horse. She was so taken by the series and it's characters that she even had her bicep tattooed with a full half-sleeve of McCrae rearing back on a horse. It was quite good work and I was quite jealous. I wouldn't mind going back to visit some of the timeless characters in those novels, they really do hold up in their unflinching depiction of the old american west, blemishes and all. Some of the most profound things I took from the stories were the details surrounding the cultures of the various native american tribes the cowboys encounter along the journeys. It's very interesting to know how the comanches and apaches were so desperately feared, and some other tribes simply were not as their way of life was much different. It also doesn't surprise me that plains native americans would be so tough and willing to fight to defend themselves given the overall harsh environment of north and west texas. One of the most striking moments in the series is when the long time adversary of Call and McCrae, the former chief of the comanches, is on his death-bed and seeks a personal journey to die alone and apart from his tribe. The cowboys have fought him for decades and want nothing but vengeance but they never get it. Instead the reader is treated to a profound moment of acceptance from an incredibly strong-willed man as he ushers himself from his world. It is truly one of my favorite books and having grown up in Texas, I some sense of pride imagining that events as romantic if at time brutal  probably took place. It makes me feel at the very least that Texas is as unique a state as we Texans would like to believe and often proclaim.","I was very sad to have finished a long novel named ""Lonesome Dove"" by Larry McMurtry.

It is difficult to even come up with a single favorite book but I did in this case. I liked it so much , maybe because at 59, I am aging and related well to the characters.  I am also a Texan.  Lonesome Dove is about two aging ex-Texas Rangers that feel the need to have one last great adventure.  This last adventure takes the form of a cattle drive from south Texas north to Montana (if memory serves me well).  There are many other characters involved with different backgrounds that could very well have books of their own.  The adventures abound and there really isn't a dull moment in the entire book.  Larry McMurtry excels at character development to the point that I felt as though I knew them.  He also excels at plots and sub-plots that are very compelling. While it isn't ""War and Peace"" long, it is a rather long book but I wished it was longer when I finished it.  I was very sad when I finished reading Lonesome Dove.  It was like losing a playmate, maybe even a friend.  I wondered what I was going to do for reading next.  I ended up researching similar books written by Larry McMurtry.  I did find other similar books that were written about the western United State at around the same time period but it just didn't match the colorful characters in Lonesome Dove. Maybe it was because I was born in the panhandle of Texas, my dad was a real cowboy and I could relate better to many of the things mentioned in the book.  As such the others paled in comparison.","I was very sad to have finished a long novel named ""Lonesome Dove"" by Larry McMurtry.

It was titled ""Lonesome Dove"" and was written by Larry McMurtry.   ""Lonesome Dove"" is the name of a near ghost town in south Texas.  The two main characters are Gus and McCall.  They are aging ex-Texas Rangers that decide to go on one last adventure.  They decide to steal some cattle from Mexico and start a ranch in the northern U.S.  I think it as Montana.  The book had very rich character development.  There were good guys, bad guys, and in-between guys.  On of the major villains is the a really bad guy name ""Blue Duck"".  One of the in-between is a girl/woman named Lori.  She is a ""lady of the night"" but sweet just the same.  Gus and McCall are kind of the good guys.  The scenery and imagery are very rich.  It is very colorful in terms of the language.  You need to remember this book and maybe get other books written by McMurtry.

3EKVH9QMEZQGD2ZDUCRYZMCOEVX2DL,1,"About six months ago, I went to the eye doctor to get my eyes checked. My eyes were getting tired quickly and I was experiencing a lot of mild headaches due to eyestrain. The doctor did a thorough examination and immediately noticed how terribly misaligned they were. He recommended me to a surgeon to get my eyes aligned. I have had misaligned eyes for almost half a century and had never considered surgery, because my older sister had surgery for her misaligned eyes and is now practically blind in one eye. I had decided to live with my condition and when I became an adult, I went through one year of vision therapy to correct the problem. Vision therapy did help, but over time my eyes went back to their old ways and turned in very significantly. The doctor explained to me that my condition is a little different from my sister's and that surgery will not cause me to lose vision, because I have alternating vision and my sister had another condition that caused her to shut one eye off completely. He said that at my age, surgery was really the only answer. So, I scheduled an appointment with a surgeon and had an evaluation done. The surgeon put all kinds of different prisms up to my left eye and immediately I saw double. The surgeon worked with me for several minutes and finally my eyes adjusted some. She told me that my left eye turned inward 70-80 points and she could only correct it to 40 points without me seeing double. She decided that it would be beneficial to do surgery on my right eye also, so that I can have at least 50 points of correction. I talked to my husband about the situation and he thought it was a good idea to have the surgery done. The surgery scheduler didn't contact me until three months later and informed me that I would have to go back down for a new evaluation before the surgery. I told her that if this was the case, I was not interested, because we had already paid $600 out of pocket for the first evaluation. She talked with the surgeon and the surgeon told her that I did not need a second evaluation, so the surgery was scheduled for August. Three weeks ago, my husband took me to the eye hospital and I underwent surgery on both of my eyes and I cannot believe how having mostly aligned eyes has changed my life! My crossed eyes have always caused people to look at me a little funny and some companies have not wanted to hire me, thinking there was something wrong with me. Children have always stared at me and asked why my eyes are so crossed. This is no longer a problem! Just last week, I took a trip into town to the grocery store and was amazed at how much better I was treated.

I thought that maybe the prescription had changed in my glasses and this was causing my headaches. I told the nurse at the office about my headaches and she ran all of the regular tests and checked for glaucoma. My eyes were healthy and they didn't find anything that should be causing the headaches. As soon as the doctor came in to see me, he took one look at my misaligned eyes and told me that I could have surgery to get my eyes lined up properly. He spent the rest of the time giving me information about the surgery and then asked if I was interested. I told him that I was and his office referred me to an eye surgeon the next day. I visited the eye surgeon, and she told me that because of my severe eye turn, she wouldn't be able to completely line my eyes up, but that she could get them close enough that an ordinary person could not tell that they were turned in some. She was afraid that I would see double the rest of my life if she completely aligned them. Long story short, I went ahead and scheduled the eye surgery. After hearing about all the risks involved, I had some trepidation. The surgery went very well and the thing that surprised me the most when I woke up was that I was not seeing double at all. My vision was a little cloudy and I was groggy, but, my field of vision was so much broader. I looked into the mirror and saw that my eyes were truly aligned! This was wonderful news! Recovery went well. I basically rested and didn't do much of anything while my husband took care of the house and our girls. The only side effect of the surgery was sore eyes for a few weeks, but my vision kept improving as time went by. I am so happy that I made the decision to get my eyes fixed.

I developed and woke up to an extreme pain. This pain radiated in my jaw, teeth, and neck, but was not the ordinary tooth or molar pain. It was intense, extreme, unbearable. Nothing would help it, not over the counter medications, or rest. It was an intense, tremoring pain --- the kind you'd experience during a boxing match or worse, during surgery without numbing. Being that I suffer from anxiety and am getting up there in age, I began to worry. Was this very serious? I contemplated my options all the while suffering. Do I go to the ER? A local Urgent Care? I tried everything I could think of to numb the pain. It was almost as if I was bitten by a poisonous creature. Was it a spider bite? So many things raced through my mind. Eventually, I realized the inside of my mouth was irritated. This was possibly from spicy food or acid reflux, and that it appeared to be possibly infected. After finally coming to and going to the ER, this was confirmed. I was given antibiotics and went home. I have since fully recuperated thankfully.","I developed a sudden severe pain, enduring it for many hours - decided to go to the ER after worrying it could be very serious (such as a stroke) and was given the all clear.

The whole day I kept ice firmly pressed against the area, trying my best to keep it at bay. The anxiousness and anxiety it caused was not good. It kept me from sleeping or focusing well, and also from working. I worried - will I need to take more pain medicine? Will the infection return? Thankfully, with full rest, mouth rinse, and a positive outlook, the pain was no more. Now, I make sure to rinse daily with this unique mouth wash and so far it's been pretty positive. Also of note, I ended up making up my work and being given reduced hours, which helped me make up the amount of money lost. The doctor at the Urgent Care Center stated it appeared to be an infection resulting from impacted wisdom teeth. Wisdom Teeth come in around 17 years of age, or start to and eventually become impacted. Impaction leads to vision problems, pain, on site infection, and shifting teeth among other things. I have experienced some pain for years over this, but only recently, has it become so bad that it incapacitates me. While I personally do not want to undergo wisdom tooth extraction, I definitely recommend it if you suffer.","I developed a sudden severe pain, enduring it for many hours - decided to go to the ER after worrying it could be very serious (such as a stroke) and was given the all clear.

Although, There are a number of critical breakthroughs that your infant will reach early in life. From straightforward assignments like sitting up or lifting their head to more progressed developments like rolling over, these small accomplishments are continuously inspiring. But there’s nothing very like seeing your baby crawling for the primary time. Many guardians are on edge to see their child crawl and closely screen their baby’s improvements. Of course, there’s completely nothing off-base with that! In any case, it’s vital to keep in mind that all babies are diverse and take after a distinctive advancement path. Most babies begin to crawl somewhere between 6 and 10 months of age. my baby started crawling at 8 months of age.","My son began crawling around and interacting with things.

He is growing so fast and I am so proud of every little accomplishment he achieves. I enjoy watching him play with the cat and the dog. We have had to move a lot of things to higher places that he cannot reach. I had to redo my home theatre system because he kept pushing buttons that I did not want him to press. I am willing to do the extra work around the house so that he has a safe and functional environment to play and learn in. I am lucky enough to work from home so I get to be around him all the time. It is great to be able to spend so much time with him and help him learn and develop his skills. I look forward to the day that he takes his next step and begins to walk.

We are much more social with each other now. talking and playing have a lot more significance now. He has grown so much in the last few months. It is clear that at this stage, his growth is faster than it has ever been. I assume that his growth will continue to accelerate until we can't even keep up with him anymore.

We had no way of knowing what she did or did not process, understand, feel, etc. So we acted on the DNR she had signed before and provided nothing but water. It was so difficult to see her there in that state, basically slowly dying and fading away. As (then) executor of her trust I began to gather everything I needed to make sure this went smoothly for my cousin (her beneficiary). It was hard to post her final goodbye to friends on FB after she passed, but I did what she asked. Then I discovered: she had not fully finished setting up the trust and I had very limited resources. Much to my surprise, I was completely unable to do everything she asked, and had to resign as executor and hand it back over to my young cousin and be there for him for support. I did what I could to give him all the info he needed and put him in touch with the trust attorney. Sadly, and surprisingly too, since I last wrote about this he has not done well. He still needs help accessing all of the resources she left him and after his power was shut off reached out for help. The surprises just don't end with this event, they just keep coming and coming and I pray they will settle down soon.","My auntie got cancer again, but died suddenly from a stroke during treatment.

But as it got closer to my delivery date, he was still saying that he didn't want a sibling. I was put on bed rest for the last couple weeks of my pregnancy. One day my water broke and we were off to the hospital. There were some complications with the delivery and I ended up needing an emergency c-section. It was a really scary experience, but my daughter was born healthy. When we brought our son in to meet his new little sister, he had a scowl on his face.

I was very excited to meet my new little girl but it was bittersweet.  This was my last pregnancy and although I was a tough one, I already knew I was going to miss the little details of carrying a child.  The small flutters that reminded you of the sweet baby in your belly, the wonder of seeing their kicks and movements, and the little gestures of kindness that are reserved for pregnant women were all things that I would never experience again.  I was also scared for the procedure.  With my first child, I had an emergency c-section so I didn't have time to stress about the whole surgery.  This time was different.  I worried about the things that could go wrong,  I didn't have the same confidence in my medical team that I had had with my first child.  I think my biggest concern was how my son was going to handle having a baby sister.  He was barely two.  I didn't know if he was going to be upset.  I was worried that he wouldn't feel loved and wanted.  When my husband brought him to my hospital room, I wanted him to feel just as important as he always had.  My son looked a bit alarmed at all the hospital equipment.   My husband brought him over to see the baby and he showed a bit of interest.  He stroked her hair and said ""baby"". That's when he leaned over to kiss the  baby on her head.  The whole room sighed at the cuteness of it.  Until the baby started screaming, that is.  Apparently, he was not as taken with his new little sister as we had hoped.  She had two tiny red marks on her forehead from where he bit her.

34S9DKFK74BF0ZJXCRCW4VPN7B2YNI,3,"Today, in Boulder Colorado, we made the long drive to the Rocky Mountain National Park. It was truly an awe inspiring trip. We drove through twisting roads, climbing ever higher, until we finally reached a height of over 11,000 feet. During the trip we were able to pull over at a number of spots to take photos of the breathtaking scenery. In Boulder, at the base of the Rocky Mountains, it was nearly 95 degrees, but at elevation the temperature was in the low 40s, which was quite shocking when climbing out of our SUV to take photos. Just before we arrived at the highest gift shop/restaurant it began to rain quite hard, then changed to sleet as we ran for cover. It was quite different from the 95 degree heat we had left only an hour and a half earlier. Looking around at the snow capped mountains, some snow only a few dozen feet from where we were standing, demonstrated the ecological diversity that one can experience without having to leave the United States. It was truly amazing eating lunch with my family and looking out at the snow on the Rocky Mountains. We were able to get our fill of souvenirs which we stock up on every vacation so we can easily remember the places we've been and the things we did. Later in the day, after the long drive down from the national park, we took our chances with white water rafting. Our family had never been rafting before, let alone in rapids. We had a spectacular time. While the air temperature at river level was still in the 90s, the cold water felt refreshing with every rapid. Being at one with nature and being able to spend an entire day experiencing some of the best that nature has to offer made me incredibly grateful to have had the opportunity to enjoy it with my family.","We spent a vacation day visiting Rocky Mountain National Park.

38SKSKU7R2J3MZ17WWAE5FRAB4YLI4,3,"Last March I went to a tax accountant. I needed to file amended returns for the Patreon income from four previous years. I'd been under the impression since I set up my Patreon account that it was gift income, and therefore non-taxable. But gradually it became my primary source of income and I shifted to self-employment as a freelance writer. And the more I looked into it the more I began to suspect it was taxable after all. I feared getting into serious trouble. In July of last year I concluded that it was indeed taxable. So I made plans to see an accountant and file for back taxes. According to my research on Google the IRS was required to allow installment payments I could afford, but I was still quite apprehensive in the months leading up to the meeting. In March I met with the accountant, gave him documentation of the additional income, and paid him $400 for preparing four years' amended returns. This was considerably cheaper than my worst-case estimate, and was in itself a significant relief. And he confirmed my information about making installment payments.

So I continued to worry that it was taxable. As I researched it, in 2018 it seemed more and more likely that it was taxable. I was worried about the amount of past income I might owe back taxes on. So I went to a tax accountant in early 2019. It turned out that I owed about 6k in back taxes for the previous four years. It was fairly easy to make monthly installment arrangements that I could afford. And my monthly income was within the personal exemption amount. This meant I only had to pay 15% self-employment tax.

I am also a very independent woman, with a good career and almost done with my MBA. So the timing is a little hectic. I always had planned on having another after my son, but when it didn't happen in a few years I started to make other plans. I have been a single mother for years and felt no need to settle, so I was planning on adopting in the next few years. I've also worked very hard on my fitness the past 2 years, and this plan felt perfect so I wouldn't have to give up the progress on my body. About 6 months ago I started dating a coworker, who is a great man. I'd even told him not to expect me to have kids if he wanted to be with me. Then after just 2 months I found out I was pregnant. At first it was a huge shock, and honestly I wasn't very happy. After some months to get used to it, I can honestly say I'm very excited now though. It's been a huge adjustment, however. I went from living alone to having my boyfriend move in to help with my bills. Being an only child, my personal space is very important to me.

My grandparents came here when they were nineteen from Europe around 1911. They had three boys and one girl . I  have one whole sister and one half sister.  My dad and mom got divorced when I was sixteen. He remarried a girl much younger that was my babysitter and they had one girl. After he married her , she stopped inviting me and my sister over   and my dad would call occasionally and say come over, but when you weren't invited over for the past few years, you don't feel that invite is sincere and I didn't go. So I am not close with my half sister and we barely speak when we see each other out. My cousins parents from my dad's siblings never got divorced. So my cousins wanted to come in for my dad's 90th and they brought all kinds of food and pictures and we had a good time . Lots of pictures were taken and everything was great. I just felt that my life and relationship with my dad was very different than my cousins and they don't understand what it is like when parents get divorced and how kids can be treated because of it. I feel cheated in that respect and felt envious that they had normal childhoods and good relationships with their parents. I still talk to my dad when I see him in the local grocery store but it is just casual talk and that is kind of sad.  He is not going to be around much longer and I wish things had been different between us but I don't think it was all my fault . I think that will probably be our last family reunion .

I had a furnished mobile home awaiting me, the lady I was interested lived very near where I would me, and money would be plentiful for my happiness.

I did manage to give some things to a couple friends that were very good momentos of my life. And I gave, sold, or left behind all my furniture as I was just moving myself and my 2 cats down to Florida in my car. Just some few momentos and my clothes were all I took. And then things got worse.........   When I got down to Florida, I found out that I'd been scammed by the person that said they had a mobile home for me to rent. THERE WAS NO FURNISHED HOME! Talk about being floored! I had to stay and pay for a motel room at first (that the landlord said she would cover.) After finding out about the scam, I booked myself into a cheaper (yet expensive) Airbnb while I tried to figure out where to stay. During all this, the woman I came down to see said she didn't want a romance, and that she just wanted a friendly platonic thing. (This after  talking to her for over 2 years over the phone.

It went well and was very cute. They both liked the same colors and everything was beautiful. All her friends from the past were part of the ceremony and it was quite uplifting. I was glad they shortened the ceremony a bit. They had original plans to do a lot more and spend more time on ceremony type things. But in the end they just focused on things they both liked and what they knew the guests would like also. So the main focus was on food and games. Not so much the formal aspects. They had so much food to choose from. It was quite entertaining the different choices they had. So much variety in foods. It probably went along with their multicultural families and life styles.

3SEPORI8WOL8L6ZDZ99AWWEPGN3ZA2,1,"In May I signed up to volunteer at a garden giveaway in my town. It's a program that provides plants, seeds, dirt and containers with dirt for portable gardens for low income people. The lady that runs it was a friend and co-worker of mine, so when I decided to start volunteering I reached out to her and she said this was something she thought I'd like. I really wasn't sure what to expect when I got there. I had worked in a community garden before and it seemed like most of the poor people who showed up just wanted the vegetables and didn't want to really put in the work needed to maintain the garden. When I showed up I was kind of skeptical about how it would go but I was ready. The event was way more than I expected. We had over 100 people show up. They didn't seem like they were just there for a handout, they wanted to learn how to maintain and grow the gardens we were giving them. They asked about watering and sunlight and took a lot of time picking the plants they wanted to grow. The best part about it was the kids that came. Sometimes they were more excited than the parents about starting the garden. It was encouraging to see. Wendy, the lady that runs the program said changing the mindset of the next generation of low income is important and I felt like we were doing that. Teaching them about the importance of vegetables and how you can grow your own might actually help them be better and healthier adults. It made me wish I had been better about this with my own son instead of just buying all my produce from the store. I don't really know how all these gardens we gave away turned out. I'm sure maybe some people just gave up and didn't really continue and see results, but I;m sure that a lot of people did benefit from the giveaway and are enjoying the fruits of their labor today. And I'm hopeful  that down the line we helped raise some future gardeners whose life will be better because of it. The whole experience of volunteering at the giveaway left me with a good feeling and I plan to work the event in years to come.

The local gardeners and high school career center students grow tomato and pepper plants and donate them to the event for the people to use to start their gardens. I volunteer at this every year.

Maybe when they get older they'll be healthier and continue to grow their gardens and even pass the tradition down to their kids. At this year's garden giveaway they had a Big Seed contest. The charity gives the seeds to the local schools who give them to the students. Each year it's a different seed. The students are encouraged to grow the plant at home (this year it was watermelon) and bring it to the Garden Giveaway and enter it in a contest for biggest plant.

33JKGHPFYDGF6IUJTOOLA02GPM3MNS,2,"About 6 months ago, I decided to learn more about the art of food foraging and how it could be beneficial to me. I started by searching the internet for anything I could find. I was surprised at how much you could learn and how complex it could be but I didn't let it scare me; I continued in my quest to learn more. I was intrigued by just how many wild foods there were out there available for us to eat. It made me realize that people aren't using the natural resources we have and that there are a lot of things that are going to waste just because we don't know it's available to us. After a week of doing extensive research, I decided to go on a hunt and see exactly what I could find. I drove about an hour away to a location that was plentiful of forest and wildlife that I thought would suit me for my foraging needs. As I walked through the woods, I stumbled upon things I had not recognized from my research, so I had to use my best judgement about whether or not this was something that could be edible. I found a patch of wild berries that looked good so I decided to try my luck and eat one. They were very sweet and did not have a bitter taste, so I ate a few more before continuing on my way. Further on my travels, I saw some wild plants so I decided to pick them and take them home with me to see what I could do with them. This was turning out to be quite the interesting adventure. I heard a rustling noise behind me so I abruptly looked over my shoulder and realized that I had entered someone else's territory. Instead of seeing a person like I expected, I saw a beautiful deer standing behind me. It didn't run away like I thought, but just looked at me inquisitively, stopped to take in the sights and smells of nature, and then slowly walked away. At that moment, I thought to myself, people and animals aren't all that different. We are all here for the same reason; survival and to try and protect what is ours. As it started getting dark, I figured it was time to pack up and take my findings home. My stomach was feeling a little bit queasy and I was hoping it wasn't the berries I ate from earlier!","I learned about food foraging from self-study, reading and videos.

I had no idea that there was so much food all around us that we simply pass by every day. It is kind of shocking to learn that there is so much plenty all around and yet we live in deprivation. I learned about it after I watched a video on it. It really opened my eyes and showed me something new. I did a bunch of reading and research which prepared me to go into the parks around me and find things. There is lots of food in the local parks in big cities. There is even stuff growing in the sidewalk planters. Things we call ""weeds"" are actually nutritious and delicious plants. I have grown alot since I woke up to all this. My horizons have expanded. My consciousness has increased. My self-reliance and self-trust has gone up. It has been a great experience.

3PQ8K71NHY67KYR5NHTBF3NG8C4AA5,1,"I have stumbled across something new to me lately. Foraging for food in the landscape around me is a real thing and I can do it. I started thinking about the plants around me when I saw a foraging video on YouTube. A teacher was showing students about all of the edible plants in a park that happens to be near my house. I was interested in the video as I have alot of experience with gardening and it dawned upon me that I could do this too. I started looking up plants online and watching other videos about plant identification. I started slowly by looking for one single type of plant and trying to identify it multiple times. After I was confident that I could identify the plant, I ate a couple of leaves just to test out the effects of it. I would wait a day and when nothing happened negative, I became more confident in my id's. I ate more the next time and continued to find out as much as I could about the plants habitat and features. Immersing myself in one plant at a time has been a great way to expand my knowledge. Now I can identify many plants in my area. I know the leaves, fruits, colors and features of a number of edible plants. This has given me a food source other than buying food from the grocery. It's amazing to see something all around you that was always there but you never saw before. I am very glad to have stumbled upon this field of knowledge.","I learned about food foraging from self-study, reading and videos.

The whole time, he looked like an ant to me and I really couldn't see him. The ceremony was enjoyable and I gushed with pride the whole time as well as a few tears. After the ceremony, I texted him to let him know where I was sitting. Luckily, I was located above the exit that the graduates were filing out of.  At the very end of the night, the most wonderful thing happened. The most memorable part of the evening was when the graduates were walking out and he looked up and made eye contact with me. We locked eyes and I have never seen him so proud and happy. It was our own special moment. That look is something I will never forget. Every time I think of that night and the pride and happiness for him that I have, the look in his eyes at that moment is the first thing that pops into my head.","This is a story about the night my son graduated from college.

I am usually not that great at taking everything in and focus on small details in my life and at events as opposed to the big picture. This night, however, I can clearly recall the view across the room, the colors, the sounds, the whole entirety of it all, and most importantly, the feelings. I know I could go back to that huge room and find the seat I was sitting in among thousands just based on the clarity of my memory. I took everything in. Before the graduation, I had trouble finding parking and rushed into the venue at the last moment, worried I wouldn't be able to find a seat. I found one way up high with pretty poor view because none of the lower ones were available. At that point, I had no idea where my son was, no idea if I would even be able to see him or not. He texted me as the commencement started and told me where he was. Based on that, I was a little upset because I had definitely chosen the opposite side of the arena from him and was very far away. In spite of that, I absorbed the whole ceremony and kept one eye always fixed on his head, small as an ant. The whole time, I balanced between crying with pride and joy and smiling so hard that my cheeks and jaw hurt. In the end, my bad seating location turned out to be central to the single most memorable moment of the night. As the graduates were being released by row to leave the room, I saw that I was sitting directly over the exit that they were filing out through. Everyone around me was standing and I'm not that tall, so as he approached the exit, I got on my toes as high as I could and raised my arm so he could hopefully see me. With about 30 feet to go before he passed under me, he looked up and directly at me and we locked eyes. I will never forget the look he had on his face. It was so almost too special to be described...a combination of pride, joy, thankfulness, humility. Words don't do justice to that little moment we shared. Mother and son loving, knowing and understanding each other without words.","This is a story about the night my son graduated from college.

The weather was gorgeous and the park was quiet, only some children with their parents playing around, and some people walking about and taking advantage of the beautiful day. Then a kind of rumbling noise started. It morphed rapidly into something more akin to a shrieking noise, with an explosive component somewhere in. And it got louder and louder, to the point where it seemed to fill the air around us completely. Of course everyone in the park started looking around to see where the noise came from. And it became quickly obvious that it came from the sky. Six jets, clearly war planes of some kind, flew over us, almost as fast as arrows. They were flying in V formation like geese - dark, deadly, shrieking metal geese. They flew toward the river, and beyond, leaving everybody shaken, overwhelmed and very surprised. Why would they fly like that over a peaceful city like ours? Where were they going? And what were they going to do out there? In that instant, I didn't feel scared for myself or my community, but I felt horrified by the sheer amount of brute force and power displayed.

I was celebrating in different ways with family and friends for the most of the day but the last place I expected to be by the end of the night was a Target.  There's this girl I've known for about 13 years now.  During those 13 years we would date, break up, date, break up.  Eventually, the last time it happened, we stopped talking for the longest time period and to me it was like we both finally got the point that it wouldn't work out.  This night, someone wanted to stop really quickly at Target because they needed something to drink and another person wanted to grab something for their phone.  I break off alone and walk through the store to find something in particular and this familiar voice calls my name.  I'm terrified and happy at the same time when I hear it because I know it's her.  I think of all of the pain and heartbreak associated with her and how much I despised her after we stopped talking three years before.  Yet, there she was, saying my name in the gentle yet comforting way she always did and smiling at me like I was something to be proud of.  We walked towards each other, stunned, and embraced one another.  For what seemed like ages, we just held each other and didn't say anything.  Finally, after two minutes or so she whispered in my ear, ""I miss you"".  I walked around with her that night and we talked for a while and caught up.  She told me how awful her life had been going and expressed how she wanted to end it all.  By the end of it all, I unblocked her from my phone and saw older texts flood in.  I ended up calling her again.

She looked different, like the happiness had been sucked out of her.  She looked tired, really tired and I wondered how she'd been.  She didn't explode with excitement or even move.  Quizzically, she just said my name again.  I greeted her and we embraced.  We hugged for what seemed like 10 minutes and then we finally broke apart and began to catch up.

The sheer size of the creatures is what stands out in my memory to this day. My children still talk about the bison, and we have included studying these animals during our homeschooling days. We also saw huge eagles and hawks! The wildlife that my children probably enjoyed the most were the prairie dogs, as they were able to get fairly close to them! The vast rock formations, and huge canyon was amazing. It was like a giant bowl in the middle of the prairie!

The restaurant was far away so I ended up carpooling with friends that also were going to the party. They picked me up at around 5 PM but had to make a stop at Target first because some of my friends had not bought a birthday gift yet. They ended up buying makeup for the birthday girl and a card and we were on our way. I already had bought a gift from Amazon so I did not buy anything at Target. We were one of the first people to get to the restaurant so we got to pick which table we wanted to sit at and thankfully we all got to sit together. It was interesting because my friend had invited 25 people, so many people who were invited I did not even talk to. Most of us did not even talk to the birthday girl because she was sitting at a different table from most of us. I ended up sitting with people that I knew, so it was as if I just went to go out to eat with these people for no occasion. Nevertheless, the restaurant was so good and I had good conversation.

3ZPBJO59KQNKSS2VDXU5MQIQ95CHD3,1,"This story was about me spending time with two separate friends. The first friend I spent time with at her birthday dinner at a korean BBQ place, the second friend I spent time with at her house to watch a movie. Dinner at the BBQ place was super fun and I was most surprised to see a soju tower on the house when I showed up. It was a huge tower-like container that has a switch and when you open it, soju just comes flowing out. The price of it was more than $30 so I was really surprised to see the restaurant just gave it to us on the house. I was also surprised by how many people showed up. I hadn't checked who else was coming and I was pleasantly surprised to see some friends I hadn't seen in a while. This dinner was significant to me because my friend was turning 21, an age that is pretty important to a lot of teens. It wasn't as important to me, but it was to my friend because she is quite a heavy drinker, so that made it important to me too. I had a really good time during the dinner. I was anxious at first because I wasn't sure where I would be sitting. Since my friend invited a lot of people I knew it was pretty guaranteed I wouldn't be able to sit with her. But I ended up finding a lot of people I knew and had a good time catching up with them. Afterwards I met up wit my other friend to watch a movie. This event was significant to me as well because I hadn't seen this friend in a while, and I got to see the new place she moved out to. It was the first time she was finally living on her own, and it was nice to see her slowly going into adulthood more. I had a really good experience writing this because it made me feel all these happy feelings I felt when I was going to the party and to my friend's house. It's pretty funny too how I forgot I even did this task and I could not remember what I had even written about.",I went to my friend's birthday party at a korean bbq restaurant.

I used to be petrified of speaking in public. once i improved I used to be petrified speaking in public. I started raising my hand o speak as often as possible.
