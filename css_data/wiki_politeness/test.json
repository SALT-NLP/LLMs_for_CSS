Doesn't that show you the items better?","10":"user: I do have one semi-newbie question: I made some edits under my IP before registering (<url>) and would like to \"claim\" them now that I have registered.

These edits were unrelated to the edit war that got the article blocked, so could you please to restore the content?","14":"user: I had some problems updating images in the <url> FAC. The images are uploaded both on Wikipedia and on Wikimedia Commons under the same name ... how do I get the links on the page to connect to the Wikimedia images rather than the Wikipedia ones?","15":"user: To ''Arbcom''?

For now, Celine's infobox says \"CBS Records Canada (1986u20131990)\", but since her discography owner\/copyright holder is still Sony Canada, should I change this to Sony Music Canada (1986-present)?","31":"user: I have now created <url> and <url>.  I wonder if a similar template may be warranted for listifying (CfL)?","32":"user: Is there any way to request a change to the citation template?

What brought you to that particular article?","38":"user: Could you please block me indefinitely. If you can't then what do I need to do to get blocked indefinitely?","39":"user: Referring to the Nomination for Deletion <url>, you suggest that Bill4Time be \"mentioned\" under List of Legal Software.

You have not gained any favorable comments for your position in the RFC (which in fact is about the treasure seeking sentence you want to add and not about rewording or removing the existing sentence), so on what basis do you claim preeminence for your preferred wording, or for removing the sentences completely?","48":"user: Is there any consensus for these changes? If I've missed the discussion, I do apologise, but could you post me a link to where it occurred?","49":"user: #On the other hand, linking years of actual encyclopedic events to \"1949 in NASCAR\" or \"1950 in motor racing\" <s>gives us a tool for eventually building those year-in-topic articles<\/s> automatically builds those categories.  Where some don't exist yet (like 1949 in both NASCAR and motor racing), are we better off adding the desired link and letting it be redlinked until the article is created, or just leaving it unlinked or wikilinked to the general year article such as <url>?","50":"user: <url> has been promoted to A-class.

What is MoS?","55":"user: I'm curious how you justify your removal of a link to the Washington Blade newspaper website in the <url> article<url>. The Blade is a valid media outlet - a newspaper dating back to 1969. Is there some bias at work?","56":"user: Why are you putting <nowiki><person><\/nowiki> on several pages related with Yu-musicians? IMO this is a pretty <strike>stup<\/strike> meaningless stub to have; why not <nowiki><person><\/nowiki> instead?","57":"user: Regarding <url>: you closed it as no consensus, and I admit its close, but there are four well thought out deletes and only three keeps don't (in my view) present any clear arguments. Do you mind taking another look?","58":"user: I noticed that (although it's striked through now), you considered opposing <url>'s adminship bid on the grounds that they suffer from auditory hallucinations.

Is there anything that I can help?","69":"user: But, before you accuse me of shying away from your second to last question, my PhD is in inorganic chemistry, homogeneous catalysis to be specific, but my latest scientific paper was submitted (still with the reviewers) to ''<url>'': it touches on the metrological consequences of the microscopic quantization of ''Q'', as it happens, although that is not its main thrust. So, do you want to thrash this out among scientists, or would you prefer to waste your time with ArbCom?","70":"user: Many people have mentioned this mythical facillity - I've never found it, and assumed it was only available to sysops, which I am not.

I had no idea you took an interest in OT scholarship - not a bit dry after General Macdonald?","79":"user: I'm gonna go ahead and do it. Thoughts before I proceed?","80":"user: As the most developed of the articles, it may be worth opening a generalist peer review on it, to try and get some idea of whether there's anything we ''aren't'' aware of.

Why don't you try to understand all parts, or write in your own language?","82":"user: I've been trying to convince this user that his only problem is his username, but he doesn't seem to fully believe it.

Should I leave the merge tag on the talk page?","93":"user: I've deleted the diagram from the <url> article because, as Curtis Clark points out in <url>, the diagram does not represent the results of the reference it purports to represent.

Instead, could I persuade you to offer comments on the FAC page of <url>?","113":"user: I do not know how to merge them. Are you familiar with the process?","114":"user: <url> is the featured article on the main page.

How come the wordings are not fact-based but seem to have devolved into media perceptions of the Vatican responses?","200":"user: I am looking for help improving the dermatology content on wikipedia. Would you be willing to help, or do you have any friends interested in derm that would be interested in helping?","201":"user: Can I get some time to finish what I am doing without everything being deleted??","202":"user: I think if we did it that way, it would add a lot of possibilities to the page, enabling us to give breakdowns of other wars and major events in separate tables as well, in addition to alternative listings, which I think would be quite useful. Because there are a lot of events with different aspects to them that could be covered in more detail IMO, what do you think?","203":"user: You're right, but loosing it because of Devanampriya, of all users, would be quite a shame for Wikipedia. Don't we have to make a stand against ignorance, partisan POV-pushing and constant incivility?","204":"user: I've been saying it has to win that award for a few weeks :) I'd be very shocked if it didn't win. Who hands out that particular award?","205":"user: The page just went major revamping through copy-editing. Do you still believe the page has bias?","206":"user: The main article needs a facelift. Do you want to make suggestions?","207":"user: I never partook in this AfD. Did you leave this on the wrong page?","208":"user: If the community decides that you no longer speak on its behalf--if the Wikipedia community decides that this supposed ban does not apply to constructive comments on AfDs on articles for which I am a major contributor, and that I may make such comments without asking for permission beforehand--who are you or anyone else to override that decision?  I'm not saying that anyone has or will make that decision--but if that decision is made, are you claiming that you are entitled to do what you want regardless of community consensus to the contrary?","209":"user: We need a visual of some kind. How's the state of your right-brain today?","210":"user: give me your personal opinion, is an article with citations and written in a mature manner, about shart, ever going to remain without being deleted? or will i just waste my time if i make it?","211":"user: I don't get the \"defaultsort\" edit you mention - can you link me to a specific edit showing this?  Also, if I rename the template will it be automatically changed on the relevant coaches' pages or do I need to do this myself?","212":"user: you could have started the discussion yourself. How can you say there was no consensus against the edits if there had been no discussion at the time you were doing the reverting?","213":"user: The article already says where they come from in the ''birth location'' field. What's the point of repeating it, especially at the expense of other info?","214":"user: How r u doing? what are u upto these days?...what are your current contribs?","215":"user: The reason given on the <nowiki><person><\/nowiki> tag (''\"Non-notable book promo\"'') seems to have nothing at all to do with the article. Is this on the correct article?","216":"user: Maybe there is a cellar to the mill, which would count towards the five. Can you get a photo or two and add to Commons?","217":"user: Despite my best efforts, I've been unable to find the coordinates for the <url>: it's a specific little spot somewhere on a rail line between two villages, 3 miles apart.  Is the \"coord missing\" template appropriate, since they're missing, or is it inappropriate, since I believe that no reliable source has that information?","218":"user: Tom, that article is ready for publication, was written by someone else, and your changes aren't improving it.  Did MER-C ask you to work on it?","219":"user: Hi, thanks for your help. There is also this sentence \"Asukkaista 84,5% oli ruotsinkielisixe4 ja 15,4% suomenkielisixe4 vuonna 1970 ja kunta oli kaksikielinen.\" What does it mean, please?","220":"user: Okay, I tagged <url> a hoax twice, but <url> has pointed out http:\/\/www.tylershoemakerracing.com\/.  I can't remember exactly what the article said, but does it agree with the source?","221":"user: I got rid of the non-notable entries. What else needs to be done?","222":"user: Hi Khoikhoi - I see you deleted a previous incarnation of a pan-Arabism article which seems to be resurfacing under variant names, and is now at <url>. This doesn't read to me like an encyclopedia article - do you have any thoughts on whether\/under what criterion it should be deleted?","223":"user: Hi, just noticed you reverted this page back to its pre-COPYVIO state.  Any reason you didn't use the content at <url>?","224":"user: I'm finding that I'm not able to access any of the DPL-related pages on the Toolserveru2013I get an error message or a blank pageu2013but somehow the Dab Challenge results are still being updated by your bot. Do you know what's going on?","225":"user: So you don't like people pointing out the errors you make? Or do you have any actual arguments to counter my post?","226":"user: Counter offer, work in a sandpit and if we can't agree, review in a week.  What do you say?","227":"user: Are you kidding me? Do you even bother to click on <url> to see its fleet?","228":"user: Reading the DYK criteria, I see that an inline reference must be placed immediately after the extraordinary fact being used as a hook, and I don't see anything extraordinary immediately before the inlines.  Could you shift an inline, or add more extraordinary bits?","229":"user: |style=\"vertical-align: middle; padding: 3px;\" | I've started the Badfinger wiki amd I need help.  You seem to know a lot about them, could you please help out?","230":"user: I think I have a general idea what this is supposed to mean, but not nearly close enough to attempt a rewrite by myself. Are we talking about a piano trio sitting around \"naming\" trios that they might want to play, or record, or just playing the sort of game that parents use to keep young kids amused on a long trip (or did before there were TVs and movies inside cars)?","231":"user: Can't confirm what <url>, because it isn't clarified in <url>. Thoughts?","232":"user: I tried to create a similar map for Canada but couldn't get a usable output from the site you used for the Australia map. Could you create a Canadian one?","233":"user: Hey, I just noticed that you are NOT an administator, I had always assumed that you were. I wondered if you would be interested in being nominated?","234":"user: Please put them all back!  Are you on DSL?","235":"user: He Colfer, just to let you know I changed the headings in name (I think we should avoid making diaries, but order based on activities), but kept (hopefully) the spirit of your changes in tact. How does it look to you?","236":"user: OK, the 3920th is done. Any further thoughts?","237":"user: DONE. Do you think everything is now sorted so I can beep Brain Boulton?","238":"user: I've had a go at sorting out markup for footnotes. Also many (most) of the external links were either direct-links or indirect-mentions of single research papers; I've worked these up where possible, but should they be moved from \"External links\" to \"References\" or better still to relevent place in the artice as footnotes?","239":"user: I saw you put images for the Kings of Bhutan and thank you. Could you find an image to use for <url> also?","240":"user: I am reluctant to mention this, but having your paragraph in bold on <url> seems to me to be a bit self-promotional and unfair to the other members. Is there any chance that I might be able to persuade you to voluntarily unbold it?","241":"user: Listed by designation, new to me? have you a guideline or discussion reference for that?","242":"user: I really think that the text you have drafted at <url> is far fuller and better than the article as currently drafted. Do you have any objection to me deleting the current text (except for the infobox which I will retain) and importing you text in its entirety?","243":"user: <url> needs urdu script for the name of the subject (Bangla script has already been added). Can you help?","244":"user: I thought I had explained it pretty clearly.  What part did you disagree with?","245":"user: I will readily grant that. But where was the urgent reason not to follow it in any of the above cases?","246":"user: Any suggestions on what admin-specific readings I should be starting to go through, and what order? E.g., the actual mechanics of how to do some of the admin-related stuff?","247":"user: While watching the contribs I noticed that the bot blanked <url> which has already been checked and is listed at <url>. Isn't that supposed to be the thing that these lists of MRGs were supposed to prevent?","248":"user: Do you have any thoughts on renaming the page to reflect that the notability (and most of the content) is about the labor dispute\/takeover, etc. than the company itself?","249":"user: Hey Love, as you wish, if you  have any suggestions about my section, let me know.  Is English a second language for you?","250":"user: Alf has a large <url> in Germany.  How on earth do you know that he is a character \"almost no one knows about\" Where you get your f'n info?","251":"user: Sorry... haven't unblocked many people before. Is it ok now?","252":"user: Interrobang has asked me if I would also help mentor you when he is not around. I said that I would gladly help out if it was ok with you?","253":"user: |style=\"vertical-align: middle; padding: 3px;\" | Hi, I wish to understand why you deleted my file. I'm kinda new here, can you help me?","254":"user: As far as I know MathSci has not edited any race related articles. If you think he is breaking his promise perhaps you should bring it up with him?","255":"user: Hello. I was just wondering, is it really fair to delete an unintentional duplication of a deleted category without a formal CFD submission?","256":"user: <url> seems does not exist. Maybe we can create <url>, which would be subcat of <url>, and include most but not all of its current content?","257":"user: In the summer (June-July) I am going to work on the ''Messiah'' article. Would you like to be in on this?","258":"user: Ta, can tell its cold here - I thought I was putting the message on your talk page and then realised it was indons, and the similar spurious etymology and anecdotal rubbish is at ratu bokos palace as well - had found a brilliant article on ratu boko in BKI but mislaid it anmd havent gone back.  There is a means by where well documented folklore can stay on an article page if the editor knows of the correct texts to qoute re folklore and spurious etymology or geneology in java - but if there is no acknowledgement of the academic\/citable ways of exlaining I say that such addons are ad hoc and worth the chop and message to user 'this is an encyc' - watcha think?","259":"user: I tried updating it to WP:DAB style but I got reverted. Can you use your magic there and explain to the user why we should follow MOS:DP and such?","260":"user: I see a \"remove protection\" tab on the <url>, which tells an admin that the article is protected.  Are you still able to edit it?","261":"user: Okay, I asked for help at <url>, was directed to <url>. What do you want to do?","262":"user: I found <url> while working <url> from <url>, my first impulse was to give it a prod, an long unreferenced orphan without a clear reason to exist.  I see you are still active on Wikipedia, is there chance you can do something for this article?","263":"user: And individually changing the refs defeats the  purpose, unless the genus is apart of the url, like in nomen.at. Do you think there is any to work with this?","264":"user: Quite. Do you know why, though?","265":"user: All those people have said to news sources they aren't running\/are\/or something related? Or am I confused?","266":"user: Once upon a time (about 6 years ago), you uploaded <url>. Would you happen to remember where you got it from?","267":"user: As a side note, I'm slightly amused that on the one hand, you caution me not to \"encourage\" the penguieater troll, explicitly striking out the \"mocking\" part, but then in the same breath you sign the finding that cites those same penguin diffs as evidence of terrible insults and intimidation. Slightly inconsistent, perhaps?","268":"user: It is my understanding that I can clean up my own talk page. Is that not true?","269":"user: I think that the standards should not apply to animated pictures like ''Tintin'' where start of production is a fuzzy limit. After all, do we have proof that the production of ''<url>'' or ''<url>'' is more advanced than the one of ''Tintin'' ?","270":"user: You had said at CFD that you were allowing some time for <url> to be listified. We're past that time, can the cat now be deleted?","271":"user: Hmm...I was not aware that a year had to pass for ''anyone'' to request an appeal for Everyking. Prior to today, when did they ever say this?","272":"user: Do you know how to make the 'All Star Template' appear only at the bottom, as well as the 'Confirmed future sites', so the actual table appears at the top of the page??","273":"user: Somebody keeps moving the Shannan Prefecture to Lhoka Prefecture. What is your view on this?","274":"user: It would seem to me that this category provides no overall benefit to wiki and only serves as another list of organizations which seem to be targeted by the generally negative tone of LGAT articles. Would it make more sense, or be more proper, to include the relevant categories on the individual articles themselves, rather than have an LGAT category?","275":"user: I'm not sure if you've changed your opinion of the article's FAC status, but I think you have guided us in a ton of good ideas.  Have you changed your opinion?","276":"user: And wasting our time as well. I can only repeat: why don't you do constructive work by adding contents about your beloved Makedonia?","277":"user: Hi, I see you were involved in creating the ship infobox. Would you be interested in creating an infobox for windmills so that I could use it on individual windmill articles?","278":"user: Hey, I found <url> and at around 1:10, I think I can see the Backstreet Boys holding platinum discs (or double platinum, I'm not sure) for Backstreet's Back and Millennium. Can you please verify and is it possible to use this as a source for adding South African certifications?","279":"user: Sounds interesting. Could people keep me in the loop as well?","280":"user: Sorry, what? Could you be more specific please?","281":"user: Just saw your post to Gonzo.  Would you rather I withdrew the FLC then?","282":"user: Thanks for reverting that obnoxious vandalism on my talk page.  How do I bring in an administrator to deal with the vandal?","283":"user: I saw today (thanks for explaining to me) that you reverted twice (i wasnt even aware i changed it twice) my edit on <url>. Maybe I have totally no clue about what that edit-status is about, but isnt it true that the presentation is over, and done?","284":"user: How are these inconsistent with the traditional account of the origins of the Torah involving redactions as late as Ezra? Why do we need bizarre hypotheses about documents being interwoven that are contrary to all known examples of how books are written?","285":"user: Tim, it strikes me that DNA is getting more than average vandalism for daytime; I suspect it's schoolbreak week somewhere.  I'm not able to help much as it takes so long for the page to load; do you think it's time to ask for a semi-protection break?","286":"user: Well, we can certainly sort out those kinds of issues once the task force has formed. Have you sought or found support through WPMILHIST yet?","287":"user: I'm responding here in an effort to keep the conversation in one place and would appreciate it if you would do the same. Did you see where I said above that images which only allow non-commercial use are still considered to be non-free?","288":"user: Hey, I just went ahead and reverted <url>. I was wondering if you wanted your userpage semi-protected to prevent that happening in the future?","289":"user: I'm wondering why in the <url> article, you keep changing the link <url> to <url> which just redirects to <url>?  Why not just leave the link to point to the intended article directy?","290":"user: Thanks for striking out the comment. Any chance of a support\/oppose vote?","291":"user: Huh? What was that supposed to mean?","292":"user: That sounds fine. When does the drive end: at the start of August 13 or at the end, and according to which timezone?","293":"user: Re: <url> and <url>, if you think they are better off as redirects to the suburb\/town rather than substubs on the lakes with a <nowiki><person><\/nowiki> tagline, you only need to overwrite the article with a redirect (or revert to a previous version that was a redirect), leaving the substub in the article history. How come you speedied them before redirecting?","294":"user: There's a question about where you got the image of the ''Enterprise''.  Maybe you could clarify?","295":"user: Your first attempt at doing this also added a <nowiki>\"<url>\"<\/nowiki> line to the article, and that's what triggered the bot.  Perhaps you should get into the habit of using the 'Show changes button?","296":"user: Thanks for your reply. You are, I take it, aware that you can be blocked for disruptive editing?","297":"user: I have made changes to <url>. Is that acceptable?","298":"user: He ''is'' offering the article to you, I think. Can you review the ''The Downward Spiral'' article <url>?","299":"user: Thanks, but I'd prefer to leave my talk page open to vandalism. No harm done if it's on a talk page, right?","300":"user: It would be nice if there was an optional protection expiration date, similar to how administrators are able to block for a definite amount of time (15 minutes, 24 hours, permanently, et cetera).  Are the developers able to implement this?","301":"user: For 2003-04 the Tony Kempster site doesn't show steps, it shows levels (this was before the steps were introduced) - <url> when steps were introduced, the KCL was classed as Step 7 - like the Essex Intermediate League (all of whose club's articles have been deleted) it has never been a Step 6 league (hence no-one objecting to the other ten articles being deleted earlier in the week. Can you reinstate the prod so save the hassle of an AfD?","302":"user: I've been going through <url> and replacing the FiveHorizons.com refs (per Quadzilla99's comments). However, refs 39 and 40 don't seem to appear anywhere else; could you perhaps replace them with more reliable sources if you get the chance?","303":"user: On another note, I'm going to assume that you were the one who also added ridership data for various LIRR stations, am I correct? If so, could you kindly point me towards your source?","304":"user: What's next? What have you got planned for the next 12 months?","305":"user: Restored history. Can check that I did it all ok?","306":"user: I was starting bio...bio-something's talk page, telling him to make it an article, not a user page, and I saw that you wanted to delete it.  Why?","307":"user: You were asking for a source for the <url> mention of the <url> service to Lagos from March 29th, which you reverted.  Would <url> do?","308":"user: That's that we have a policy against picture gallery links.  But could you tell me where that is?","309":"user: Hi Acad - the above has led me to two native Danish speakers on the English wiki - <url> and Saddhiyama--<url> - the first is \" very active on naval articles.\" and has just translated HMS Falcon (1802) for Danish Wiki<url>.  Thoughts?","310":"user: Are you both \"Dribblingscribe\" and \"Indiestu\" ? Do both those accounts belong to the same person?","311":"user: Well? Shall I request outside assistance?","312":"user: I'm not familiar with that article. Can you please specify the exact article title?","313":"user: This was supposed to have been moved to <url> per the CFD. Why wasn't it moved?","314":"user: If you took them and don't mind if anyone can use them for free then you should probably upload them on <url>. However, it depends what the pictures are of, what is in the picture?","315":"user: I do not know what you mean by \"important links\" as you mentioned on my talk page. Will you please clarify?","316":"user: Why have you restored this article deleted pursuant to a perfectly acceptable AfD? Am I missing something here?","317":"user: What if you just take the corresponding part from '' fand er sich in seinem Bett zu einem ungeheuren Ungeziefer verwandelt.''?","318":"user: I'm always happy to give a second opinion on ID - you're welcome to put images on my talk page to discuss them. Regarding <url>, I would tend to go with ''<url>'', what do you think?","319":"user: This user, whom you recently blocked, has persisted in using both his user and user talk pages for repeat personal attacks. Would it be wise to protect these pages?","320":"user: I have a question for an audio editing expert.  Do you personally know a lot about the science of waves, or do you just deal with the program Audacity?","321":"user: I'm attempting to be incisive, and the articles integrity hasn't been disrupted. Therefore i see no reason why you chose to comment unless you felt that ive wiped out important information?","322":"user: Especially considering that it took you ''a lot'' more time to vandalize the page than the two seconds it took us to fix it. What's the point?","323":"user: But in this case, at least there is an actual author making the claim, which is generally where I draw the line.  Is Wood an inappropriate or fringe source, and if so, what makes her so?","324":"user: OMG! Do Phaedriel and Acalamari have a WikiCrush on each other?","325":"user: Thanks--can you add the romanization of the Arabic at <url> too? Is it ''jibna baladi''?","326":"user: Hi there. Regarding the comment you added <url>, how can this be verified?","327":"user: experence suggests that most of the time it is an extreamly good criteria but in this case I've put the links back. Which morris side are you with?","328":"user: Anything else to add to this article? Shall we put it up for GAN?","329":"user: Notability is an issue of common sense: you're writing for other people, so what is notable for you (or me) is not that relevant. My local shop is more important and notable ''to me'' than Wal-mart, but who, other than me, actually cares?","330":"user: Have you and I reached a compositional (English, not content) impass? Perhaps we should hash it out away from the article and install after having reached teh big A (accomodation or agreement)?","331":"user: Some time ago, you uploaded separate maps for each town and unincorporated community in <url>.  Do you have similar maps for any other counties, or a town-level map of the entire state?","332":"user: Hi Zaps, I've noticed that you edited the abovementioned article. Could you please provide your sources?","333":"user: If I were to make that map I probably would chose to have two colours, one for states using JCP as a disciplinary measure and one for states which do not. What do you think?","334":"user: - This IP has been doing the same to me. There seems to be a remarkable similarity with <url>, could this be a case of sockpuppeting?","335":"user: I will take out Haskett in deference to you. OK?","336":"user: OK, lets get a screenshot then. What is your keyboard layout, is it a qwerty keyboard?","337":"user: Yes I can. Is it an alternate account?","338":"user: Just wondering why removed death material? Perhaps another article on his death and circumstances- legacy?","339":"user: p.s. I'd be right that you're a supporter of corporal punishment, I presume?","340":"user: I actually know nothing about karate, but you look to be doing a good job with your work, and I'm just here to say sorry really that some of your articles got deleted. Which artiles got deleted?","341":"user: If you're not using your user page, you should try redirecting it to your talk. Or is this a statement on the futility of userpages in general?","342":"user: Oh, no, sorry. Why do you want to talk to me on IRC?","343":"user: Lowell\/Lawrence Blvd leading from Lowell to the Methuen Rotary is a device from hell as well.  How many people does that short stretch of road have to kill?","344":"user: Why are you uploading\/changing badge files here? Surely you should just upload them to Commons then list the wikipedia version for deletion?","345":"user: She did so in Switzerland. What makes you think a photo that was deemed not to be a \"work\" in Switzerland was not a work in the U.S., where the threshold of originality is much lower?","346":"user: <url>.  Draft beer?","347":"user: You also did three reversions. Where are the administrators, meanwhile?","348":"user: Is there any way I could talk you into being more conservative with creation of new articles?  Do you agree that some of what you're creating here would be seen as obviously deletable material by most editors?","349":"user: Your recent edits with Dab solver seem to be removing rather a lot of links, without mentioning this in the edit summary. Is this intended behaviour?","350":"user: '''Question''' to both of you.  Would it be considered canvassing to notify every participant of the AfD of the discussion at <url> and ask for their input?","351":"user: Thank you for your kind comment.   Do you have a suggestion where the portals should be placed in the article?","352":"user: Later the same can be done for the other sports. What do you say?","353":"user: There are a few posts at <url> saying people are having trouble seeing the DYK picture that's up now. Do you think you could switch it?","354":"user: Hello Glacier109, I am contacting you because in golf they put Money not Winnings as the standard on most leaderboards used at the end of tournaments.

Any chance of a full date of death for him?","356":"user: <url> OrphanBot doesn't realize that <person> is a license tag.  ?","357":"user: Why are you trying to delete my user page, literally less than a minute after I began it. You are allowed one so why not me?","358":"user: What is the context that you think is lacking? any suggestions  on what to add?","359":"user: you need a copy, you say... by that you mean a translation, or one which has been reconstructed to meet en. wiki coding?","360":"user: Your early edit's clearly indicate that you were not a newbie. How do explain this?","361":"user: Just curious about <url> edit. Did you confuse the territory of <url> with the region of Quebec called <url>?","362":"user: Re <url>: I reverted once. Shouldn't I get a cut of the proceeds?","363":"user: Stephen's solution certainly isn't optimal. Fancy giving me a basic rundown on the problem here and I'll see if I can devise a more elegant one?","364":"user: Hi, you recently edited that the Independence Hall was once the tallest building in Philadelphia on the <url> article.  Do you have any source that supports this?","365":"user: You said that you set your watchlist to auto-refresh. How do you do this?","366":"user: Another article created by Jergens.

Do we keep them?","371":"user: Do the titles of WP articles generally pass partisan judgment on the subject under discussion? Should they?","372":"user: I have proposed the merge for you at these pages: <url>\/<url>. Is that what you wanted?","373":"user: Making edits vanish without a trace would be ''extremely'' difficult to do u2013 only full <url> could do that, and I can assure you the oversighters wouldn't do such a thing just to allow somebody to cover their tracks. Maybe you are mis-remembering something, about edits that were in fact on some other page?","374":"user: Hmmm, you are basically asking me to think positively despite evidence and knowing that over this issue none good faith on part of some users was showed in past, but ok, letxb4s see how it goes. The question then is: do you consider including the discussions with outside mediation participants that happend on those talk-pages (direktor, for exemple, has been very active and enthusiastic there lately) or only the in-mediation discussions are the ones that count?","375":"user: Actually, if she is releasing a new single from the debut album, the title \"Home Run\" wouldn't encompass this. Someone else has changed it to \"Debut album\" which I think is more suiting, what do you think?","376":"user: Thanks for your recent edits on <url>, but what does \"inapplicable category\" (referring to <url>) in <url> mean? And why did you remove that category from <url>?","377":"user: Well, I suppose it is only reasonable for you to conclude that everyone behaves as you and your allies do. If \"good typography\" is whatever Dicklyon likes, why shouldn't the truth be whatever subserves Dicklyon's cause?","378":"user: True. What do you think about the notability of this particular article?","379":"user: I've asked Jza84 if he could have a go at drawing a new plan, he's asking if we have any source material he could work from. The only one I can think of is the plan currently in the article, do you have any others?","380":"user: Take a look at the speedy delete I just posted. Was that the right one to do or was an AFD called for there?","381":"user: That was nice work you did improving the reference I added. I still have to learn that, can you show me?","382":"user: Hi I saw that you make maps and plans. Could you make me some that good plans, of station?","383":"user: I have some made some improvements to the articles you references on the above user's talk page. Perhaps next time you would bring your concerns directly to '''me'''?","384":"user: How about this for a novel solution?  The next time a banned editor posts something to your page, why not delete it yourself with an edit summary of \"Sorry, I'm topic-banned from discussing this\"?","385":"user: Hi, yes I love your stats tool too. But could it also cover wikiversity and perhaps the other sister projects?","386":"user: After finally reaching some agreement not to declare \"what Christians believe\" about a controversial point, why did you just revert the beginning of the article to make such a declaration?  Can we please drop the POV declaration?","387":"user: I see that you are becoming a little bit paranoid. Do i need to do a check user for you ?","388":"user: So what do you think they want, anyway? I mean does this boil down to the words ''murder'' and ''kidnapping'' along with ''Brigham did it cuz he looked like a duck and quacked like a duck'' or what?","389":"user: When you said \"we're RBIing\" I assumed you were associating your edits with those of TenOfAllTrades. Were you associating your edits with those of someone else, or do you use the plural pronoun?","390":"user: I just sat through last Sunday's horror show... The less said about that the better. Any idea who Maurice LaMarche voiced so I can update the guest star list?","391":"user: Why the removal of the citation dealing with coriolis?  Was the proof not within the citation, or was the citation not considered primary?","392":"user: Yep, she told me.  How are you doing?","393":"user: Hey, ixb4m on your side there any way we can discuss it with more users? Or just over one of the Talk pages (2011 Site)?","394":"user: I hope I am now signed on and you remove the erroneous vandalism report. Don't you think it would be more politic to send a message with a question than to preemptorily declare an edit \"vandalism\"?","395":"user: In case you didn't realize, one of the first things they states on that article was that if the information on a main or major character becomes long, then it warrants its own article. So, if that the case, then why did you merge <url>, since his article is long and he is the main character on <url>?","396":"user: kindly explain why did you remove my changes. The added links were quite relevant and informational, also The Vanguard Group and Hi5, why do you revert my edits?","397":"user: Your contributions show no edits to any RfC's.  Could you provide a link?","398":"user: The Olbermann thing is being discussed on the <url> talk page.  Do you have anything to add?","399":"user: Well perhaps I am \"out of touch\".  Can you please point me to where a new consensus has formed on this issue?","400":"user: ...just vandalized my page again. What level warning is appropriate?","401":"user: Thanks for the response.  May I ask, are you a video gamer?","402":"user: I was about to participate in the Afd on Wooster Greeks.  You've reverted yourself and re-closed it?","403":"user: Hello, I'm just wondering how you have found out all the birthdates for the Coronation Street characters? Does it say somewhere?","404":"user: I mean if you can help me to restore my userpage, the orginal version is to simple and when i look at your page it is perfect. I like also the editorstar, how can i get this item on my page?","405":"user: Which authorities are you referring to? Can you give the name of a linguist\/grammarian who considers that removing the accents from a French, Polish or Serbian person's name creates an exonym?","406":"user: Damn it! Should we just revert back to the beginning of the day, since what I wrote was based on analyzing the satellite data?","407":"user: Thanks, firstly, for the affirmation and work on <url>; it was yesterday's featured article! As a related article, I've been working on <url> - what do you think would be necessary to get it to FA?","408":"user: I know ''shin'' is one letter in the Hebrew alphabet, but the \"sh\" in English is a diphtong and there should be no need to transliterate the shin to SH. Have you seen this convention in any other articles?","409":"user: Hey, several of the footnotes that you use in <url> are Harvard footnotes, which means that they need the full citation of the books in works cited section. I imagine you grabbed some of that information from some other places, would you mind retriveing the bibliographic data?","410":"user: Indian cultural imperialism is rampant this am - what nxt? we have had the mongolians and indians - maybe the astragoths next?","411":"user: I see you have a BugZilla account. How do you make it so it doesn't show your email to everybody?","412":"user: Cool. Is this something I can invoke with a template on the page or something?","413":"user: Everything about <url> looks fantastic, but.. going to |2 instead of |30em seems like a major step back. Is there a reason for it?","414":"user: I don't think it is too unreasonable to archive messages you have read by deleting them - they are still available in the page history. Is there a policy guideline that they should be archived, and not deleted?","415":"user: Yep, I'm definitely free for the whole break. Had fun in your trip?","416":"user: It needs to be redirected anyone can do that. Is there any information that is in the article that is not in <url>?","417":"user: Hi, do you mind if I move your hook to go live on 26\/27th? The GLAM WIKI conference could do with being highlighed by a non US\/UK hook?","418":"user: But that doesn't follow <url>.  Perhaps you can discuss the idea there?","419":"user: What's with all the crap behind him? Was this at a signature desk?","420":"user: Shouldn't <url> have 2010 as his final year? It's pretty late into 2011 to be getting fired, but as I understand it, his navbox should read 2010, and then whatever coach takes the lead for this season will be the interim, no?","421":"user: Dan, can you take a look at the last exchange regarding the 1952 election?  Looking at the citations, is there doubt in your mind that there was a deal, or at least that it has been widely suggested by reliable sources that there was a deal?","422":"user: Well, I do have one question. If I were to come across a page that I would normally mark as a CSD- like copyright infringement, etc, as an admin can I just delete it or do I need to mark it CSD and ask another opinion?","423":"user: The answer is \"one citation per city\". Information must always be verifiable; without verifiable sources for say, Unna, how exactly are we to tell that the article is accurate?","424":"user: Sure. I have to warn you, though, the file size advantage has pretty much been lost since SVG font rendering went the way of the dinosaurs :) Do you make a point of having the border, or can I leave it out?","425":"user: Hey, I just tried to link to Marat Ayin and it came up as a red link. Do you know if we have an article on it and I'm just not using the right transliteration or do we really not have an article?","426":"user: <url>  Honestly, I'd like to know if you really are defending <url>.  Do you really believe that they were justified?","427":"user: What you really need to do if you want an article on 'Do Anything Nice' is to establish its notability. Can you find multiple non-trivial mentions in reliable sources that refer to it?","428":"user: Picking up your challenge. You a big fan of skittles or something?","429":"user: Da ti mene nisi sa nekim pobrkao? Kakve ja veze imam sa tim Faust Vranu010diu0107em?","430":"user: I didn't see your internal link, I put it back.  <url> isn't orphaned, what are you talking about?","431":"user: I must be missing something here.  Would you mind clarifying for me the nature of your extensive work on <url>?","432":"user: You added managerial stats but they state Ferguson only managed St.Mirren for 12 games.  That's too few given he was there for 4 years, please can you fix?","433":"user: If it were me I'd want to try and find out more about how\/why this happened first before I continued to use that software. Have you asked at the talk page I mentioned above?","434":"user: Very well I won't contact you anymore. Geez, whatever happen to the spirit of collaboration?","435":"user: Not really sure what the remedy is for this, but anyway, now you know. How was your weekend?","436":"user: Stole ur flag for my page. that ok?","437":"user: This is one of those rare situations where I really have no idea what to say. Thanks?","438":"user: It is an obvious and strongly followed point that april fools jokes ''should not disrupt the running of the wiki''. Could you explain why the HELLS you coated a dozen users' pages with pictures of jimbo's ugly bearded fizzogg?","439":"user: I have to admit that I am wary of the word \"compromise\" because I honestly do not understand what purposes are better served by KSmrq's version than by mine. Can someone fill me in?","440":"user: You're unblocked. Do you want to discuss what the article should be named?","441":"user: He's still got the youtube link on there even after your reversion. How does once vs. 25 times or so make any difference?","442":"user: Correct me if i'm wrong, but isn't that ''also'' -- now -- an egregious violation of WP:NPA? As in: casually making false statements?","443":"user: Hi.  Not complaining, but why did you remove the category \"high schools in california\" from this article?","444":"user: If the llamas of Peru spoke Spanish, and one asked the other, ''xbfCxf3mo se llama?'', would he get confused?","445":"user: Jvhertum, Last year you made this change :http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=A_Split-Second&action=historysubmit&diff=343316267&oldid=343252107 to the <url> article with the justification that \"A is part of the name\". This does not appear to be a valid reason to exclude it (<url> has a DEFAULTSORT of Beatles despite 'The' being part of the name), your thoughts ?","446":"user: Hi Elen. Are you aware that you are currently listed at <url> as inactive?","447":"user: That sounds like they are just \"general use\" of the word, so in each article delink and (if needed) explain that, in this context, diaphragm means a divider - or just rewrite without the word diaphragm, or use a link to wiktionary. In fact, should linking to wiktionary be a standard way to clear up some of the links to dab pages?","448":"user: Well, if it isn't \"ours\" to feature, why is it \"ours\" to use? Do you mean to say that, for you, the best possible encyclopedia would not use images from outside sources, no matter their license?","449":"user: When I try to edit the article <url> I'm refused to save my edit due to a \"Blacklisted Hyperlink\". What's wrong?","450":"user: Hi Zaps, thanks for adding a source to the timetable as a reference for the destinations served. But how do you know that Sharjah and Istanbul are operated as charter flights?","451":"user: I'm loathe to come running to an admin, but Gregcaletta is just making the same edits that I had undone before and made objection to on the talk page without any attempt to address the previous objections on the talk page. Now what?","452":"user: Don't you think it's taken too far back to be of any use? Do we have any alternatives?","453":"user: Thanks for readjusting the <url> remarks on stationsby - I must confess I'm not that much into Danish history, so my edit contained some guesswork... thanks for correcting me. Do I understand correctly that a Stationsby would not be the station that originaly is intended for a town further away, around which then a new town grows up?","454":"user: Somewhat related, shouldn't <url>, be renamed to <url>? I realize that Baha'i forbids sectarianism, but this is what the article is about, no?","455":"user: I always thought it would be better to list both missions (up and down) but only include one patch (up) to clarify the fact that it is one mission altogether, this is how it's done in other articles about non-career astronauts and cosmonauts. Is there a policy that says anything about this?","456":"user: \"Book\" in question is A4 or thereabouts, and runs to a grand total of 32 pages including covers. It does state that it is a journal of SIAS, No 18 \/ 1988. There's not much to choose between the two templates though, is there?","457":"user: I have absolutely no idea what you are talking about.  Please be more precise?","458":"user: The icon is appearing before the number and after . Can you have a look ?","459":"user: Well, in that case we should simply point the shortcuts to where they originally pointed, which in most cases is unrelated to both VIE and VINE. That sounds like a fair and neutral compromise, no?","460":"user: Very nice. How could I doubt you?","461":"user: Thanks!  What type of documentation do you want u2014 an explanation of using the notes feature?","462":"user: No worries, thanks for doing that. Nice to hear from you again - new username for 2013?","463":"user: Do you mind if you tell me why do you add duplicate links to the article? More specifically, why do you add internal links to the See Also sections when those links are already in the article navbox?","464":"user: I'm sorry, but that does not respond to my question at all. Should I take it to indicate a no?","465":"user: Regarding \"within the church\", the problem is on one end that purring that prepositional at the beginning feels very clunky, but that other formulations almost all result in something like \"at ... at\", which is no better. I can't see a way to just juggle the sentence, so a different structure seems to be necessary; maybe a formulation with a verb like \"contains\" or \"include\" instead would work better?","466":"user: Not offended - let's talk about it.  Doesn't \"Avatar\" refer to the series as well as the character?","467":"user: That's still not the original source, and after searching through a few pages on Flickr, I'm assuming the original is all rights reserved anyway. Can I ask why you believe it is public domain?","468":"user: That incident is already mentioned in the <url>. Why do you insist on redundantly adding it?","469":"user: I will endeavour to be (cant think of antonyms) non-combative and kind. Will you give me a particular example of what I wrote and what I should have written?","470":"user: Thanks for the information (I'd guessed that it was Belgrade, but I didn't want to add that until I was sure).  About my second question: do you know if he campaigned to be elected mayor of Belgrade, or for someone else, or what?","471":"user: No problem. Have you heard anything new about HRE?","472":"user: Thanks. And, what about the <url> about \"he drowned\" not being reflexive in Spanish?","473":"user: Thanks very much indeed! :-) I don't suppose you'd fancy having a deadlink trawl over at <url>, would you?","474":"user: What City in Connecticut do you live in? And have you been to the north as your name suggests?","475":"user: A wikipedia project that serves as a place where users can get signatures, userboxes.... stuff like that, so they don't have to make it themselves or ask a specific user to do it. What do you think of that idea?","476":"user: Indef-blocked. Any idea whose sock this is?","477":"user: I noticed that you did some work on this article, and would like to expand it to include his recommendation (in ''Can Life Prevail'') that the UN develop hit squads to target large urban population centers (with neutron bombs as I recall), and also the discussion on the 9\/11 terrorists being \"superior moral human beings\" for their actions.  Understanding that this is a BLP, that NPOV is important, and that including secondary sources is nearly impossible as they are difficult (at best) to find, what is your feeling on this?","478":"user: Saw your note on Herbythyme's pageu2014this is great! How come this isn't more widely \"publicized\"?","479":"user: Just wondering, is there any reason why you removed categories from a number of articles and replaced them with the non-existend <url>. Wouldn't <url> have been the better choice, which, as it appears, is a category you yourself created a few days ago?","480":"user: The Hitchin-related hoax claims by <url> seem to have led to a rather precipitate response, considering that he has only been an editor for a few days.  Is there something going on here that isn't obvious?","481":"user: Congrats! I thought you were going to be away today?","482":"user: Thanks, but why specifically? Because I know the difference between ''hale'' and ''hail''?","483":"user: The old article was deleted. Have you had a chance to read the discussion and rationale for this decision?","484":"user: Then I think that we need to be a little poetic, rather than the rather prosaic \"qualities associated with his weapons\". What about something like \"the magical properties attributed to his weapons\"?","485":"user: Why were there 2 message bars at the top when i got new messages? Is that what it's supposed to do?","486":"user: I was just reminded of my offer to generate a list of uncategorised templates, when I happened across your bot request again.  Are you still interested in such a thing?","487":"user: I'm confused. Why did I get a user warning relating to this article?","488":"user: I happened to notice this odd edit here: <url>. A weird thing for an anon IP to do?","489":"user: I think it look tidier. What do you think?","490":"user: Hey, you seem to know a bit about coding, so I figured you might have an answer here. If I want use code to grab the target of a page known to be a redirect, how would I do that?","491":"user: I find it done both ways on the web.  If some convention requires capitalizing it even though it's not anything like a proper noun, I think that should get explained in the article, otherwise reasonable people will wonder who it's named after: someone named Saros, but what's his first name and where's the Wikipedia article about him?","492":"user: Acad, at <url> the article suddenly starts talking about ''Pomone'' without any context - is this a typo?  You're a major contributor - can you clarify?","493":"user: I'm leaving radiant\/nescott to you. Can I ask you to look at my report of UBeR, please?","494":"user: Please stop mentioning my name in relation to FW. <url> How many times do I have to ask?","495":"user: If you can't back up that I've used it in WP with a diff\/evidence, do you feel that it's appropriate to say that I've used the term in the context such as the diff I provided above?  If so, why?","496":"user: Hi, I hadn't realized that you had made a revert on redirecting this.
