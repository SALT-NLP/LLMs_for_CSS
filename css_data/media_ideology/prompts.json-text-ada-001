KCNA/via ███ .\nTrump did not make clear to what he was referring , but his comments seemed to be a further suggestion that military action was on his mind .\nIn a speech to a meeting of the powerful Central Committee of the ruling Workers ’ Party on Saturday , a day before Trump ’ s most recent comments , state media said Kim had addressed the “ complicated international situation ” .\nNorth Korea ’ s nuclear weapons are a “ powerful deterrent firmly safeguarding the peace and security in the Korean peninsula and Northeast Asia , ” Kim said , referring to the “ protracted nuclear threats of the U.S. imperialists . ”\nIn recent weeks , North Korea has launched two missiles over Japan and conducted its sixth nuclear test , and may be fast advancing toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland .\nNorth Korea is preparing to test-launch such a missile , a Russian lawmaker who had just returned from a visit to Pyongyang was quoted as saying on Friday .\nDonald Trump has previously said the United States would “ totally destroy ” North Korea if necessary to protect itself and its allies .\nThe situation proved that North Korea ’ s policy of “ byungjin ” , meaning the parallel development of nuclear weapons and the economy was “ absolutely right ” , Kim Jong Un said in the speech .\n“ The national economy has grown on their strength this year , despite the escalating sanctions , ” said Kim , referring to U.N. Security Council resolutions put in place to curb Pyongyang ’ s nuclear and missile program .\nThe meeting also handled some personnel changes inside North Korea ’ s secretive and opaque ruling center of power , state media said .\nKim Jong Un ’ s sister , Kim Yo Jong , was made an alternate member of the politburo - the top decision-making body over which Kim Jong Un presides .\nAlongside Kim Jong Un himself , the promotion makes Kim Yo Jong the only other millennial member of the influential body .\nHer new position indicates the 28-year-old has become a replacement for Kim Jong Un ’ s aunt , Kim Kyong Hui , who had been a key decision maker when former leader Kim Jong Il was alive .\n“ It shows that her portfolio and writ is far more substantive than previously believed and it is a further consolidation of the Kim family ’ s power , ” said Michael Madden , a North Korea expert at Johns Hopkins University ’ s 38 North website .\nIn January , the U.S. Treasury blacklisted Kim Yo Jong along with other North Korean officials over “ severe human rights abuses ” .\nKim Jong Sik and Ri Pyong Chol , two of the three men behind Kim ’ s banned rocket program , were also promoted .\nState media announced that several other high ranking cadres were promoted to the Central Committee in what the South Korean unification ministry said could be an attempt by North Korea to navigate a way through its increasing isolation .\n“ The large-scale personnel reshuffle reflects that Kim Jong Un is taking the current situation seriously , and that he ’ s looking for a breakthrough by promoting a new generation of politicians , ” the ministry said in a statement .\nNorth Korea ’ s foreign minister Ri Yong Ho , who named Donald Trump “ President Evil ” in a bombastic speech to the U.N. General Assembly last month , was promoted to full vote-carrying member of the politburo .\n“ Ri can now be safely identified as one of North Korea ’ s top policy makers , ” said Madden .\n“ Even if he has informal or off the record meetings , Ri ’ s interlocutors can be assured that whatever proposals they proffer will be taken directly to the top , ” he said . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

Right ? With spies and treason , right ? We used to handle them a little differently than we do now . ''\nThe letter also references a $ 50,000 ( £40,600 ) `` bounty '' that two conservative Trump supporters have offered as a `` reward '' for information about the whistleblower .\n`` Unfortunately , we expect this situation to worsen , and to become even more dangerous for our client and any other whistleblowers , as Congress seeks to investigate this matter , '' Mr Bakaj 's letter adds .\nMr Maguire faced lawmakers last week and said he believed the whistleblower acted in `` good faith '' .\nImpeachment is the first part - the charges - of a two-stage political process by which Congress can remove a president from office\nIf the House of Representatives votes to pass articles of impeachment , the Senate is forced to hold a trial\nA Senate vote requires a two-thirds majority to convict - unlikely in this case , given that Mr Trump 's party controls the chamber\nOnly two US presidents in history - Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson - have been impeached but neither was convicted and removed\nOn Sunday evening Mr Trump retweeted a Fox News guest who warned that if Mr Trump is removed from office it will spark `` a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal '' .\nIllinois Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger condemned Mr Trump 's tweet as `` repugnant '' .\nIt came as part of a massive Twitter volley against his critics , in which Mr Trump said he wanted to meet the whistleblower .\n`` I want to meet not only my accuser ... but also the person who illegally gave this information , which was largely incorrect , to the 'Whistleblower .

Polls consistently demonstrate a majority of Americans - on the left and the right - disapprove of the president 's penchant for social media invective and the apparent lack of discipline it represents .\nIf a weekend spent on scorched-earth responses mark Mr Trump 's impeachment battle plan - with him tweeting the shots from his phone - it may make for a shaky defence and cause growing unease among Republicans who contemplate the challenges of campaigning for re-election under the president 's banner in 2020 .\nIn a complaint filed last month , a whistleblower from the intelligence community reported his `` urgent concern '' that the president had used his office to `` solicit interference from a foreign country '' in the 2020 US election .\nThe impeachment inquiry launched on Tuesday now focuses specifically on Mr Trump 's call to the Ukrainian president about the Biden allegations .\nDemocrats accuse Mr Trump of improperly seeking foreign help in the hope of smearing Mr Biden and of using military aid as a bargaining tool .\nUkrainian ex-prosecutor general Yuriy Lutsenko has told the BBC that there was no reason to investigate Mr Biden or his son Hunter Biden , who had worked for a Ukrainian energy firm .\nDemocrats in Congress - which is currently in recess - say they plan to remain in Washington over the break to move `` expeditiously '' on with impeachment hearings and subpoenas .\nLawmakers say in addition to the whistleblower , they also wish to speak with the president 's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani , who Mr Trump asked the Ukrainian president to co-ordinate with on an inquiry into the Bidens . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "2": "SEOUL/WASHINGTON ( ███ ) - North Korea has scheduled the dismantlement of its nuclear bomb test site for sometime between May 23 and 25 in order to uphold its pledge to discontinue nuclear tests , the country ’ s state media reported on Saturday a month ahead of a historic summit .\nThe official Korean Central New Agency said dismantlement of the Punggye-ri nuclear test ground would involve collapsing all of its tunnels with explosions , blocking its entrances , and removing all observation facilities , research buildings and security posts .\n“ The Nuclear Weapon Institute and other concerned institutions are taking technical measures for dismantling the northern nuclear test ground ... in order to ensure transparency of discontinuance of the nuclear test , ” KCNA said .\nU.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will hold talks in Singapore on June 12 , the first-ever meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader .\nTrump ’ s Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday that North Korea can look forward to “ a future brimming with peace and prosperity ” if it agrees to quickly give up its nuclear weapons .\n“ North Korea has announced that they will dismantle Nuclear Test Site this month , ahead of the big Summit Meeting on June 12th , ” he tweeted . “ Thank you , a very smart and gracious gesture ! Thank you , a very smart and gracious gesture ! ”\nSouth Korea ’ s presidential office echoed the sentiment on Sunday , saying it shows Pyongyang ’ s willingness to denuclearize through actions beyond words .\nHowever , in spite of its pledge to stop testing , North Korea has given no indication it is willing to go beyond statements of broad conceptual support for denuclearization by unilaterally abandoning a nuclear weapons program its ruling family has seen as crucial to its survival .\nIn announcing the plan to shut Punggye-ri last month , Kim said North Korea no longer needed to conduct tests because it had completed its goal of developing nuclear weapons .\nKCNA said journalists , including from the United States and South Korea , would be invited to cover the event , to “ show in a transparent manner the dismantlement of the northern nuclear test ground to be carried out ” . The exact date of the closure will depend on weather conditions , the agency said .\nRelated Coverage South Korea welcomes North Korea 's schedule for dismantling nuclear test site\nTo accommodate the traveling journalists , North Korea said various measures would be taken including “ opening territorial air space ” .\nSouth Korean officials said in April that North Korea also planned to invite experts from the United States and South Korea for the Punggye-ri shutdown , but KCNA made no mention of this .\nLast month , South Korean President Moon Jae-in had asked the United Nations to help verify the shutdown .\nSouth Korea ’ s deputy nuclear envoy Jeong Yeon-doo will visit the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) in Vienna this week to discuss the “ complete denuclearization of North Korea ” the foreign ministry said on Sunday .\nAll of North Korea ’ s six known nuclear bomb tests have taken place at Punggye-ri , in the northeastern of North Korea where a system of tunnels have been dug under Mount Mantap .\nAccording to Chinese academic reports , North Korea ’ s most recent nuclear test in September of what Pyongyang said was a hydrogen bomb , was so large it triggered a collapse inside the mountain , rendering the entire site unusable for future tests .\nBut U.S. intelligence officials have said it remains usable and could be reactivated “ in a relatively short period of time ” if it was closed .\nJeffrey Lewis , director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at California ’ s Middlebury Institute of International Studies , said in a blog post this week that recent satellite images had shown the removal of some buildings from the site .\nOn Saturday , he told ███ that closure of Punggye-ri did not mean much in terms of disarmament , given that the United States , for example , stopped nuclear testing in 1992 .\n“ It would , however , require North Korea to clear out the test tunnels and rebuild any infrastructure that might be removed — or dig new tunnels at the site or elsewhere . So , it ’ s a good confidence building measure , but not necessarily a sign of irreversible disarmament . ”\nSiegfried Hecker , a former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the United States and a leading expert on North Korea ’ s nuclear program , said collapsing the Punggye-ri tunnels would be “ a big and positive step , ” given his belief that North Korea still required more nuclear and missile tests to reach the U.S. mainland with a nuclear-tipped missile .\nHowever , he said the other crucial steps North Korea needed to take to demilitarize its nuclear program were to shut its plutonium production reactor , and open its uranium processing to inspection . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

The company behind Ben & Jerry ’ s ice cream , Dove soap and a host of other consumer products says it will stop advertising on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram in the U.S. through at least the end of 2020 because of the amount of hate speech online . ( AP Photo )\nOAKLAND , Calif. ( AP ) — Facebook said Friday that it will flag all “ newsworthy ” posts from politicians that break its rules , including those from President Donald Trump .\nSeparately , Facebook ’ s stock dropped more than 8 % , erasing roughly $ 50 billion from its market valuation , after the European company behind brands such as Ben & Jerry ’ s and Dove announced it would boycott Facebook ads through the end of the year over the amount of hate speech and divisive rhetoric on its platform . Later in the day , Coca-Cola also announced it joined the boycott for at least 30 days .\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg had previously refused to take action against Trump posts suggesting that mail-in ballots will lead to voter fraud , saying that people deserved to hear unfiltered statements from political leaders . Twitter , by contrast , slapped a “ get the facts ” label on them .\nUntil Friday , Trump ’ s posts with identical wording to those labeled on Twitter remained untouched on Facebook , sparking criticism from Trump ’ s opponents as well as current and former Facebook employees . Now , Facebook is all but certain to face off with the president the next time he posts something the company deems to be violating its rules .\n“ The policies we ’ re implementing today are designed to address the reality of the challenges our country is facing and how they ’ re showing up across our community , ” Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page announcing the changes .\nZuckerberg said the social network is taking additional steps to counter election-related misinformation . In particular , the social network will begin adding new labels to all posts about voting that will direct users to authoritative information from state and local election officials .\nFacebook is also banning false claims intended to discourage voting , such as stories about federal agents checking legal status at polling places . The company also said it is increasing its enforcement capacity to remove false claims about local polling conditions in the 72 hours before the U.S. election .\nEthan Zuckerman , director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ’ s Center for Civic Media , said the changes are a “ reminder of how powerful Facebook may be in terms of spreading disinformation during the upcoming election . ”\nHe said the voting labels will depend on how good Facebook ’ s artificial intelligence is at identifying posts to label .\n“ If every post that mentions voting links , people will start ignoring those links . If they ’ re targeted to posts that say things like ‘ Police will be checking warrants and unpaid traffic tickets at polls ’ — a classic voter suppression disinfo tactic — and clearly mark posts as disinfo , they might be useful , ” he said .\nBut Zuckerman noted that Facebook “ has a history of trying hard not to alienate right-leaning users , and given how tightly President Trump has aligned himself with voter-suppressing misinfo , it seems likely that Facebook will err on the side of non-intrusive and ignorable labels , which would minimize impact of the campaign . ”\nEarlier in the day , shares of Facebook and Twitter dropped sharply after consumer-product maker Unilever announced a new ad boycott on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram through at least the end of the year .\nThe European company said it took the move to protest the amount of hate speech online . Unilever said the polarized atmosphere in the United States ahead of November ’ s presidential election placed responsibility on brands to act .\nIn addition to the decline in Facebook shares , Twitter ended the day more than 7 % lower .\nUnilever , which is based in the Netherlands and Britain , joins a raft of other advertisers pulling back from online platforms . Facebook in particular has been the target of an escalating movement to withhold advertising dollars to pressure it to do more to prevent racist and violent content from being shared on its platform .\n“ We have decided that starting now through at least the end of the year , we will not run brand advertising in social media newsfeed platforms Facebook , Instagram and Twitter in the U.S. , ” Unilever said . “ Continuing to advertise on these platforms at this time would not add value to people and society . ”\nFacebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment . On Thursday , Verizon joined others in the Facebook boycott .\nUnilever “ has enough influence to persuade other brand advertisers to follow its lead , ” said eMarketer analyst Nicole Perrin . She noted that Unilever pulled back spending “ for longer , on more platforms ( including Twitter ) and for more expansive reasons ” — in particular , by citing problems with “ divisiveness ” as well as hate speech .\nSarah Personette , vice president of global client solutions at Twitter , said the company ’ s “ mission is to serve the public conversation and ensure Twitter is a place where people can make human connections , seek and receive authentic and credible information , and express themselves freely and safely . ”\nShe added that Twitter is “ respectful of our partners ’ decisions and will continue to work and communicate closely with them during this time . ” \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

Fighter jets , drones and other weaponry will also be deployed .\nPresident Donald Trump announced the move earlier on Friday . He said the deployment was `` relatively small '' .\nA top US official has accused Iran directly of attacking oil tankers .\nTensions rose this month after shipping in the Gulf of Oman was damaged by a series of mystery explosions .\nThe US has already deployed an aircraft carrier and bomber planes .\nBut only on Thursday , Mr Trump said that he did not think more troops would be needed .\n`` I do n't think we 're going to need them , '' he told reporters . `` I really do n't . I would certainly send troops if we need them . ''\nMr Shanahan said he had `` approved a request from the combatant commander for additional resources '' in the region .\nHe said the move was intended to `` safeguard US forces given the ongoing threat posed by Iranian forces , including the IRGC [ Iran 's Revolutionary Guard Corps ] and its proxies . ''\nThe IRGC is the most elite military unit in Iran . Last month , the US designated it as a foreign terrorist organisation .\nMr Shanahan said that `` additional intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance aircraft '' would be deployed as well as a team of engineers . He said a fighter aircraft squadron and a Patriot missile-defence system would also be sent .\nIt is `` a prudent defensive measure ... intended to reduce the possibility of future hostilities , '' Mr Shanahan said .\nEarlier on Friday , President Trump told reporters outside the White House that a `` relatively small '' deployment had been approved .\n`` We want to have protection in the Middle East , '' he said , adding that the extra troops would be `` mostly protective . ''\nHe appeared to downplay the possibility of tensions escalating further . `` Right now , I do n't think Iran wants to fight and I certainly do n't think they want to fight with us , '' he said .\nThis fresh deployment of troops and hardware has been signalled for a number of days , but it is a much more modest move than many expected . Around 1,500 service personnel are likely to be despatched , significantly down on the 5,000-10,000 that some administration sources had floated .\nIn addition to the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier and B-52 bombers already announced , extra Patriot missile batteries will give the US significant capabilities to counter any threat from the air , be that missiles or aircraft . And the deployment of surveillance planes , both manned and unmanned , will allow a clearer assessment of Iranian activity such as the alleged attacks on commercial tankers recently ( which some have blamed on Tehran ) and any troop movements along the coast .\nWhat is still far from clear is whether there is a settled view in Washington about the nature of the increased threat from Iran and what should be done about it . Despite some tough rhetoric , the president has appeared reluctant to become overly entangled in the region , mindful no doubt of his promises to bring troops back from there and not the reverse .\nTensions between the US and Iran began rising this month when Washington ended exemptions from sanctions for countries still buying from Iran . The decision was intended to bring Iran 's oil exports to zero , denying the government its main source of revenue .\nMr Trump reinstated the sanctions last year after abandoning the landmark nuclear deal that Iran has signed with six nations - the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and Germany .\nIran has now announced it it will suspend several commitments under the deal .\nFour oil tankers were damaged in what the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) said were sabotage attacks while drone attacks on two oil pumping stations in Saudi Arabia by Yemen 's Houthi rebels - who are supported by Iran - forced the temporary closure of a pipeline .\nIran denied it was behind the incidents but Rear Admiral Michael Gilday , director of the US Joint Staff , accused the IRGC of being directly responsible .\n`` The attack against the shipping in Fujairah [ part of the UAE ] , we attribute it to the IRGC , '' he said on Friday , explaining that limpet mines used in the attacks had been linked directly to the IRGC . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

( Thomas Wells/The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal via AP , File )\nThe number of high school seniors applying for U.S. federal college aid plunged in the weeks following the sudden closure of school buildings this spring — a time when students were cut off from school counselors , and families hit with financial setbacks were reconsidering plans for higher education .\nIn the first weeks of the pandemic , the number of new applications fell by nearly half compared to last year ’ s levels , fueled by a precipitous decline among students at low-income schools , according to an ███ analysis of federal data . The numbers have risen as states and schools have launched campaigns urging students to apply for aid , but they remain down overall from last year .\nIt ’ s raising alarms among education officials who say thousands of students may be opting to delay or forgo college , with potentially dire consequences for their job prospects and future earnings .\n“ The consequences are that kids are going directly into the workforce . They ’ re closing the door on post-high school learning , ” said David Nieslanik , principal of Southridge High School in Beaverton , Oregon , where he saw only more affluent students file for aid once instruction moved online .\nThe FAFSA , short for Free Application for Federal Student Aid , is required for students to be eligible for federal Pell grants and student loans . It ’ s also often a requirement for state aid . Students who complete the form are far more likely to enroll in college , studies have found , and those who receive aid are more likely to stay in college .\nIn the four weeks starting March 13 , the number of completed applications was down 45 % compared to the same period the year before , according to the AP analysis . It was sharpest at Title I schools , a federal designation for public schools that have larger shares of low-income students , which saw a 52 % decrease , compared to a 39 % slide at other public schools .\nOverall , applications were down by 70,000 as of June 19 , representing a 3.7 % drop for the entire application cycle .\nEven before the pandemic , some states had been expecting to see decreases as demographic shifts result in fewer high school seniors , and plenty of individual schools saw filings hold steady or increase . However , as the coronavirus started to spread , every state saw numbers slide compared to last year ’ s levels , even states that had more high school seniors this year .\nSchools say the pandemic contributed to the slide in several ways . Separated from their schools , students lost touch with counselors who typically guide them through the complex financial aid process . Families without reliable internet access struggled to complete the online form . And amid economic turmoil , some students took jobs and put college plans on hold .\nThe pandemic ’ s timing worsened its impact on low-income students , experts say : While more affluent students typically submit the FAFSA earlier in the application cycle , low-income students are more likely to wait until March or April , the time when schools were shutting down .\nGregory Cole , principal of the Mojave High School in North Las Vegas , Nevada , said it came at “ the very worst time . ”\nMany parents lost jobs as the region ’ s gaming industry shut down , and some students took jobs in groceries or fast food chains . Compounding the problem , many students come from families that had never filed the form , which requires a range of tax and Social Security records .\n“ We ’ re the lifeline for a lot of our kids , ” Cole said . “ Without us there to help them through the process , I think it ’ s inevitable that some of them are going to fall through the cracks . ”\nOnce schools closed , counselors could no longer pull students into their offices to talk , or invite families to school to navigate the FAFSA . Instead , schools were left sending emails that often went unanswered , or they relied on unwieldy video chats to help families with paperwork .\nThere ’ s hope that the decrease is partly tied to students who plan to attend community colleges and are waiting to file until closer to those schools ’ deadlines , which are often later , said Justin Draeger , president and CEO of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators . Still , he worries that the drop-off may be more than a “ temporary blip . ”\n“ During recessions , traditionally more people go back to school to retool . But this just feels very different because of the pandemic , the illness , the job loss , and then the quarantines that might reappear this year , ” he said . “ All of this says to me , there are a lot of things to be worried about . ”\nEducation officials are encouraging students to apply over the summer , even if only to see how much financial aid they could receive . North Carolina recently launched a “ FAFSA Frenzy ” campaign , while Kentucky is hosting “ FAFSA Fridays ” urging students to apply .\nAlthough deadlines for some state scholarships have passed , students can still apply for federal aid for the 2020-21 school year through June 2021 .\nIn Louisiana , one of several states where students are required to file the FAFSA in order to graduate from high school , state officials waived that rule because of the pandemic . But state education officials are still calling and texting students in districts with lower completion rates .\nAs of June 19 , applications among the state ’ s low-income students were down by nearly 9 % .\n“ We are not going to stop , ” said Sujuan Boutté , executive director of the Louisiana Office of Student Financial Assistance . “ We ’ ve got to be that rock that says , ‘ I do understand that there ’ s a lot of uncertainty , but this is a ticket to your future and you don ’ t want to put that on hold . ’ ”\nOfficials in Kentucky say they ’ re working hard but aren ’ t optimistic they ’ ll catch up with last year ’ s numbers . Even if they do , they worry that many students who filed will ultimately not enroll in college .\n“ We may reach the same percentage , but I ’ m not optimistic that all of those students will be going to college , ” said Aaron Thompson , president of the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education . “ If I ’ m wrong about this , I will be shouting hallelujah . ”\n___ Binkley reported from Boston .

( ███ ) - The jury in the bank and tax fraud trial of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort ended its third day of deliberations on Monday without reaching a verdict .\nThe judge said the jury would reconvene on Tuesday morning .\nThe case is the first to go to trial stemming from Special Counsel Robert Mueller ’ s investigation into Russia ’ s role in the 2016 U.S. presidential election , although the charges largely predate Manafort ’ s five months working on Donald Trump ’ s successful campaign .\nManafort faces five counts of filing false tax returns , four counts of failing to disclose offshore bank accounts , and nine counts of bank fraud . If convicted on all the charges , he could spend the rest of his life in prison .\nA conviction would undermine efforts by Trump and some Republican lawmakers to paint Mueller ’ s Russia inquiry as a political witch hunt , while an acquittal would be a setback for the special counsel .\nIn a break with convention , Trump weighed in on the trial on Friday , calling the case against Manafort at the federal court in Alexandria , Virginia , “ very sad ” and lauding his former associate as a “ very good person . ”\nOn Monday , Trump accused Mueller ’ s team of “ enjoying ruining people ’ s lives ” and trying to influence the elections in November when Republicans will try to hold on to control of Congress .\n“ Mueller ’ s Angry Dems are looking to impact the election .

    "9": "President Donald Trump addresses the nation from the White House on the ballistic missile strike that Iran launched against Iraqi air bases housing U.S. troops , Wednesday , Jan. 8 , 2020 , in Washington . ( AP Photo/ Evan Vucci )\nPresident Donald Trump addresses the nation from the White House on the ballistic missile strike that Iran launched against Iraqi air bases housing U.S. troops , Wednesday , Jan. 8 , 2020 , in Washington . ( AP Photo/ Evan Vucci )\nWASHINGTON ( AP ) — The U.S. and Iran stepped back from the brink of possible war on Wednesday as President Donald Trump signaled he would not retaliate militarily for Iran ’ s missile strikes on Iraqi bases housing U.S. troops . No one was harmed in the strikes , but U.S. forces in the region remained on high alert .\nSpeaking from the White House , Trump seemed intent on deescalating the crisis , which spiraled after he authorized the targeted killing last week of Iran ’ s top general , Qassem Soleimani . Iran responded overnight with its most direct assault on America since the 1979 seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran , firing more than a dozen missiles at two installations in Iraq . The Pentagon said Wednesday that it believed Iran fired with the intent to kill .\nEven so , Trump ’ s takeaway was that “ Iran appears to be standing down , which is a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing for the world . ”\nDespite such conciliatory talk , the region remained on edge , and American troops including a quick-reaction force dispatched over the weekend , were on high alert . Last week Iranian-backed militia besieged the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad , and Tehran ’ s proxies in the region remain able to carry out attacks such as the one on Dec. 27 that killed a U.S. contractor and set off the most recent round of hostilities .\nHours after Trump spoke , an ‘ incoming ’ siren went off in Baghdad ’ s Green Zone after what seemed to be small rockets “ impacted ” the diplomatic area , a Western official said . There were no reports of casualties .\nGen. Mark Milley , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , warned that it was “ perhaps too early to tell ” if Iran will be satisfied that the missile strikes were sufficient to avenge the Soleimani killing .\n“ We should have some expectation , ” Defense Secretary Mark Esper added in a Wednesday briefing , “ that Shiite militia groups , either directed or not directed by Iran , will continue in some way , shape or form to try and undermine our presence there , ” either politically or militarily .\nThere is no obvious path to diplomatic engagement , as Trump pledged to add to his “ maximum pressure ” campaign of economic sanctions . He said the new , unspecified sanctions would remain in place “ until Iran changes its behavior . ”\nIran ’ s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the overnight strike was not necessarily the totality of Iran ’ s response .\n“ Last night they received a slap , ” Khamenei said . “ These military actions are not sufficient ( for revenge ) . What is important is that the corrupt presence of America in this region comes to an end . ”\nTrump , facing perhaps the biggest test of his presidency , credited the minimized damage to an early warning system “ that worked very well ” and said Americans should be “ extremely grateful and happy ” with the outcome .\nThe strikes had pushed Tehran and Washington perilously close to all-out conflict and left the world waiting to see whether the American president would respond with more military force . Trump , in his nine-minute , televised address , spoke of a robust U.S. military with missiles that are “ big , powerful , accurate , lethal and fast. ” But then he added : “ We do not want to use it . ”\nIran for days had been promising to respond forcefully to Soleimani ’ s killing , but its limited strike on two bases — one in the northern Iraqi city in Irbil and the other at Ain al-Asad in western Iraq — appeared to signal that it , too , was uninterested in a wider clash with the U.S. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted that the country had “ concluded proportionate measures in self-defense . ”\nTrump , who is facing reelection in November , campaigned for president on a promise to extract the United States from “ endless wars . ”\nOn Wednesday , he said the United States was “ ready to embrace peace with all who seek it. ” That marked a sharp change in tone from his warning a day earlier that “ if Iran does anything that they shouldn ’ t be doing , they ’ re going to be suffering the consequences , and very strongly . ”\nMembers of Congress were briefed on the Iran situation Wednesday afternoon in closed-door sessions on Capitol Hill , where Democrats and some Republicans expressed dissatisfaction with the administration ’ s justifications for the drone strike on Soleimani .\nRepublican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah said it was “ probably the worst briefing I ’ ve seen , at least on a military issue , in the nine years I ’ ve served in the United States Senate. ” He said it was “ distressing ” that officials suggested it would only embolden Iran if lawmakers debated the merits of further military action . He and Sen. Rand Paul announced their support of a largely symbolic war powers resolution to limit Trump ’ s military action regarding Iran .\nDemocratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced after the briefing that the House would vote Thursday on a war powers resolution of its own .\nTrump opened his remarks at the White House by reiterating his promise that “ Iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. ” Iran had announced in the wake of Soleimani ’ s killing that it would no longer comply with any of the limits on uranium enrichment in the 2015 nuclear deal crafted to keep it from building a nuclear device .\nThe president , who had earlier pulled the U.S. out of the deal , seized on the moment of calm to call for negotiations toward a new agreement that would do more to limit Iran ’ s ballistic missile programs and constrain regional proxy campaigns like those led by Soleimani .\nTrump also announced he would ask NATO to become “ much more involved in the Middle East process. ” While he has frequently criticized NATO as obsolete and has encouraged participants to increase their military spending , Trump has tried to push the military alliance to refocus its efforts on modern threats .\nLike the U.S. troops in the region , NATO forces have temporarily halted their training of Iraqi forces and their work to combat the Islamic State .\nSoleimani ’ s death last week in an American drone strike in Baghdad prompted angry calls for vengeance and drew massive crowds of Iranians to the streets to mourn him . Khamenei himself wept at the funeral in a sign of his bond with the commander .\nMilley and Esper told reporters that a total of 16 missiles were fired from three locations in Iran . Eleven hit the Ain al-Asad air base in Iraq ’ s western Anbar province and one targeted a base in Irbil in Iraq ’ s semi-autonomous Kurdish region . The missiles were described as likely short-range with 1,000- to 2,000-pound warheads . Four failed to detonate , they said .\nMilley added that the Pentagon believes that Iran fired the missiles with the intent “ to kill personnel. ” He praised early warning systems , which detected the incoming ballistic missiles well in advance , providing U.S. and coalition forces adequate time to take shelter at both bases . He described the damage to tents , parking lots and a helicopter , among other things , as “ nothing major . ”\nOfficials also said that the U.S. was aware of preparations for the attack . It ’ s unclear if any intelligence identified specific targets or was more general .\nAin al-Asad was first used by American forces after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled dictator Saddam Hussein , and it later was used by American troops in the fight against the Islamic State group . It houses about 1,500 U.S. and coalition forces . Trump visited it in December 2018 , making his first presidential visit to troops in the region . Vice President Mike Pence visited both Ain al-Asad and Irbil in November .\nTrump spoke of new sanctions on Iran , but it was not immediately clear what those would be . The primary agencies involved in implementing such penalties – the departments of Commerce , State and Treasury – do not preview those actions to prevent evasion .\nSince withdrawing from the 2015 nuclear deal , the administration had already imposed harsh sanctions on nearly every significant portion of Iran ’ s economic , energy , shipping and military sectors .\nWednesday ’ s efort to deescalate the conflict came after world leaders , including Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin , appealed for restraint .\nThe fallout for Trump ’ s order to kill Soleimani had been swift .\nIraq ’ s Parliament voted to expel U.S. troops from Iraq , though Trump said they would not be leaving .\nTrump and top national security officials have justified the Soleimani drone strike with general statements about the threat posed by the general , who commanded proxy forces outside Iran and was responsible for the deaths of American troops in Iraq . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

( Saul Loeb/Pool via AP )\nWASHINGTON ( AP ) — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi unveiled a more than $ 3 trillion coronavirus aid package , a sweeping effort with $ 1 trillion for states and cities , “ hazard pay ” for essential workers and a new round of cash payments to individuals .\nThe House is expected to vote on the package as soon as Friday . But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said there is no “ urgency. ” The Senate will wait until after Memorial Day to consider options .\n“ We must think big , for the people , now , ” Pelosi said Tuesday from the speaker ’ s office at the Capitol .\nLines drawn , the latest pandemic response from Congress will test the House and Senate — and President Donald Trump — as Washington navigates the extraordinary crisis with the nation ’ s health and economic security at stake .\nThe Democrats ’ Heroes Act is built around nearly $ 1 trillion for states , cities and tribal governments to avert layoffs , focused chiefly on $ 375 billion for smaller suburban and rural municipalities largely left out of earlier bills .\nThe bill will offer a fresh round of $ 1,200 direct cash aid to individuals , increased to up to $ 6,000 per household , and launches a $ 175 billion housing assistance fund to help pay rents and mortgages . There is $ 75 billion more for virus testing .\nIt would continue , through January , the $ 600-per-week boost to unemployment benefits . It adds a 15 % increase for food stamps , new subsidies for laid-off workers to pay health insurance premiums under a COBRA law and a special “ Obamacare ” sign-up period .

Bills don ’ t take a pause . ”\nBut the 1,800-page package is heading straight into a Senate roadblock .\nRepublicans are wary of another round of aid and McConnell declared the Democratic proposal a grab bag of “ pet priorities. ” He said Tuesday it is not something that “ deals with reality . ”\nHouse Republicans also took a pass . “ I can ’ t believe that that would be real , ” said Rep. Andy Biggs , R-Ariz. , leader of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus , said in an interview .\nThis would be the fifth coronavirus package . It ’ s a starkly partisan offering with no real input from Republicans , who prefer to assess the impact of earlier expenditures before approving more .\nBut the political peril of doing nothing during an election year could prove challenging for Congress and the White House . As states experience flareups of virus outbreaks , and more than 30 million Americans remain unemployed in the shutdown , the near-term health and economic outlook remains daunting .\nThe Senate Democratic leader , Chuck Schumer of New York , warned that Trump and Republicans risk the same path as Herbert Hoover , the former president roundly criticized for failing to act to stem the Great Depression .\n“ What is it going to take for Mitch McConnell to wake up and see the American people need help , and they need it now ? ” Schumer said .\nThe latest package extends some provisions from previous aid packages , and adds new ones .\nThere is $ 25 billion for the U.S . Postal Service . There is help for the 2020 Census , including the bureau ’ s request to delay deadlines for turning over apportionment and redistricting data . For the November election , the bill provides $ 3.6 billion to help local officials prepare for the challenges of voting during the pandemic .\nThe popular Payroll Protection Program , which has been boosted in past bills , would see another $ 10 billion to ensure under-served businesses and nonprofit organizations have access to grants through a disaster loan program .\nFor hospitals and other health care providers , there ’ s another $ 100 billion infusion to help cover costs and additional help for hospitals serving low-income communities .\nThere ’ s another $ 600 million in funding to tackle the issue of rapid spread of the virus in state and federal prisons , along with $ 600 million in help to local police departments for salaries and equipment\nMcConnell said he is working with the White House on next steps . His priority is to ensure any new package includes liability protections for health care providers and businesses that are reopening . Trump is expected to meet Tuesday with a group of Senate Republicans .\n“ I don ’ t think we have yet felt the urgency of acting immediately , ” McConnell told reporters earlier this week at the Capitol .\nAs states weigh the health risks of re-opening , McConnell said Tuesday the nation needs to find a “ middle ground between total lockdown and total normalcy . ”\nTop GOP senators flatly rejected the House bill . “ What Nancy Pelosi is proposing will never pass the Senate , ” said Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming , the third-ranking Republican .\nThe Senate recently reopened its side of the Capitol while the House remains largely shuttered due to the health concerns .\nSenators have been in session since last week , voting on Trump ’ s nominees for judicial and executive branch positions and other issues .

    "11": "The claim : It has taken longer for Donald Trump to have his `` full cabinet '' confirmed than any president in US history .\nReality Check Verdict : Democrats have slow-walked many of Mr Trump 's presidential nominations . It has taken longer so far for him to get the majority of his choices confirmed , although part of that is due to the lateness of a few nominations and delays in submitting background-check paperwork . Mr Trump still has months to go , however , before he sets a record for how long it has taken to have all his cabinet positions filled .\nOn 7 February Donald Trump tweeted that it was a `` disgrace '' that he did not have his full cabinet of top-level presidential appointments confirmed by the US Senate . He called it the `` longest such delay in the history of our country '' and blamed it on Democratic obstruction .\nHis message echoed comments made by other prominent Republicans in Congress and his own administration .\nPress secretary Sean Spicer said the length of time it has taken to get Mr Trump 's presidential nominations confirmed was `` ridiculous '' .\n`` The Senate Democrats have done everything in their power to slow the work of the Senate , while the president continues to take decisive action , just like he promised , '' he said .\nSenate majority leader Mitch McConnell said `` Democrat obstruction has reached new extreme levels '' , which he called a `` historic break with tradition '' .\n`` It 's time to finally accept the results of the election and move on , '' he added .\nAt its most basic level , Mr Trump 's tweet about the historic nature of the delays in assembling his `` full cabinet '' is demonstrably false .\nAs of 8 February , Mr Trump has had six of his 15 cabinet selections confirmed by the Senate , with several more awaiting final Senate approval . While he still has a way to go before his entire team is in place , it 's hardly historic at this point .\nBill Clinton did n't have his final spot filled until 11 March . Republican George HW Bush took until 17 March . Barack Obama holds the modern record , as his last pick - Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius - did n't get her Senate vote until 28 April .\nOnly George W Bush , who like Mr Trump won the presidency without securing a plurality of the popular vote , had his full team in place within weeks of his inauguration , following John Ashcroft 's confirmation as attorney general on 30 January .\nWhile Mr Trump 's assertion is without basis in fact , he - and his fellow Republicans - are on firmer ground with a more general complaint about delayed confirmations .\nOf the past five presidencies , Mr Trump has by far the fewest confirmed cabinet selections at this point . Only two of his nominees - Secretary of Defence James Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly - were approved on inauguration day . Mr Clinton had three , Mr Obama had six , and George W Bush had seven . By mid-February , Mr Obama had all but three of his picks seated . Mr Clinton had all but one . George HW Bush was missing four .\nPart of the reason it took so long to fit those last pieces into their cabinets is because those past presidents had to withdraw initial selections due to scandal or insurmountable political opposition . George HW Bush 's defence pick , John Tower , was voted down by the Senate . Mr Clinton swung and missed twice on attorney general before settling on Janet Reno . Mr Obama withdrew commerce nominees twice and health and human services once .\nSo far , Mr Trump has stuck with his original picks - although labour secretary nominee Andrew Puzder has yet to complete his ethics review and has had his confirmation hearing delayed four times .\nPuzder is n't the only one of Mr Trump 's wealthy nominees who has had difficulty completing the Office of Government Ethics ' vetting paperwork , which has contributed to confirmation delays . Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross were among those who were tardy in complying with background-check requirements .\nMr Trump was also remarkably slow to come up with several cabinet picks . He did n't announce Veterans Affairs nominee David Shulkin until 11 January . Agriculture pick Sonny Perdue was unveiled just two days before inauguration on 20 January - an astounding fact , considering of Mr Trump 's four predecessors , only four original nominations came after New Year 's Day ( George HW Bush 's energy pick James Watkins was the latest , on 12 January ) .\nThis is n't to discount the obvious efforts Democrats have made to drag out the confirmation process for some Trump picks .\nThey staged walk-outs at committee hearings for health and human services nominee Tom Price and treasury 's Steven Mnuchin , delaying approval votes by a day . They gave long speeches that held up votes for Mr Sessions in committee vote and Ms DeVos on the Senate floor .\nThey 've used bits of arcane Senate procedure and parliamentary manoeuvres to gum up the works where they can - although , due to their minority status , they can only delay , not derail .\nAlthough the efforts have been futile , Democratic senators are voting `` no '' on Mr Trump 's nominees at an increasingly higher rate . More Democrats cast votes against Ms Devos than all previous education secretaries combined , dating back to the position 's creation in 1980 .\nThere have been a total of 111 no votes in the five nominees who have come up for a full Senate vote so far - compared with only 18 in the entirety of Mr Clinton 's presidency . Mr Obama 's choices had 406 no votes , but that was over the course of eight years and 31 nominations .\nDemocrats have also pumped up the anti-Trump rhetoric , throwing red meat to a Democratic base that is furious at any signs of compromise or accommodation .\n`` If not total unanimity , we 're going to have near Democratic unity in opposing the remaining nominees for President Trump 's cabinet , '' Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer said on Monday . `` This unity makes clear just how bad this cabinet would be for America 's middle class and those struggling to get there . ''\nWhile Republicans cite statements like Schumer 's as examples of unprecedented Democratic intransigence , Democrats are quick to note that in the latter days of the Obama administration , conservatives were equally vigorous in their opposition to the president 's selections .\nMerrick Garland , whose Supreme Court nomination languished for 10 months before expiring without a hearing , is foremost in their minds , but even Mr Obama 's second-term cabinet picks faced record-breaking delays .\nHis choice for labour secretary , Thomas Perez , took 121 days to be confirmed . John Bryson , his commerce pick , waited 126 days . Attorney General Loretta Lynch holds the modern record , as 161 days passed before getting Senate approval .\nIf a Trump nominee had that sort of delay , he or she would n't assume office until well into June . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

The agreement avoided a second trial on money laundering and other charges .\nThe plea deal meant Manafort would face up to 10 years in prison and would forfeit four of his properties and the contents of several bank accounts - but deadlocked charges from the previous trial would be dismissed .\nIt was the first criminal trial arising from the justice department 's investigation into alleged Russian interference in the presidential elections .\nHowever , the charges related only to Manafort 's political consulting with pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine , largely pre-dating his role with the Trump campaign .\nThe White House has insisted that the guilty plea had absolutely nothing to do with President Trump .\nIn a court filing on Monday , Mr Mueller said that after signing the deal `` Manafort committed federal crimes by lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Special Counsel 's office on a variety of subject matters '' .\nThe filing did not give details of what Manafort allegedly lied about .\nIn the same filing , Manafort 's legal team said their client had `` provided information to the government in an effort to live up to his co-operation obligations '' .\n`` He believes he has provided truthful information and does not agree with the government 's characterisation or that he has breached the agreement , '' his lawyers said .\nAs prosecutors allege he breached the agreement , Manafort could now potentially face harsher sentences or have charges against him re-filed .\nManafort has been held in a detention centre in Virginia since June .\nThis is seen as a blow to Mr Mueller 's Russia probe . As investigators no longer believe Manafort is a credible witness , they will not be able to use his testimony in their case .\nExperts say Manafort could now face a longer prison sentence and more criminal charges .\nOne lawyer told Reuters that the consequences could be `` potentially devastating '' for Manafort .\nHowever , some observers have speculated that Manafort might be hoping for a presidential pardon .\nManafort , 69 , worked for the Trump presidential campaign for five months in 2016 and was in charge when Mr Trump clinched the Republican party nomination .\nPresident Trump has branded the Mueller investigation a `` witch hunt '' and insisted there was no collusion between his team and Russia . The Kremlin has also repeatedly denied any meddling .\nManafort was charged by Mr Mueller last October and at trial he was accused of using 31 foreign bank accounts in three different countries to evade taxes on millions of dollars .\nProsecutors presented evidence of Manafort 's luxurious lifestyle , saying it was only possible because of his bank and tax fraud . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "13": "WASHINGTON ( ███ ) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday instructed the House Judiciary Committee to draft articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump for pressuring Ukraine to investigate a political rival . [ nL1N28F0C8 ]\nWhat happens next and why Trump is unlikely to be removed from office are both explained here .\nThe founders of the United States feared presidents abusing their powers , so they included in the Constitution a process for removing one from office .\nThe president , under the Constitution , can be removed from office for “ Treason , Bribery , or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors . ”\nHigh crimes and misdemeanors have historically encompassed corruption and abuses of the public trust , as opposed to indictable violations of criminal statutes .\nFormer President Gerald Ford , while in Congress , famously said : “ An impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history . ”\nNo president has ever been removed as a direct result of impeachment . One , Richard Nixon , resigned before he could be removed . Two , Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton , were impeached by the House but not convicted by the Senate .\nImpeachment begins in the House , the lower chamber , which debates and votes on whether to bring charges against the president via approval of an impeachment resolution , or “ articles of impeachment , ” by a simple majority of the body ’ s members .\nThe Constitution gives House leaders wide latitude in deciding how to conduct impeachment proceedings , legal experts said .\nThe House Intelligence Committee has conducted an investigation into whether Trump abused his power to pressure Ukraine to launch investigations that would benefit him politically , holding weeks of closed-door testimony and televised hearings before issuing a formal evidence report .\nThe Judiciary panel will use the report to consider formal charges that could form the basis of a full House impeachment vote by the end of December .\nIf the House approves articles of impeachment , a trial is then held in the Senate .

Mr Trump has rejected allegations of any collusion .\nThe extra conversation happened during a private meal of heads of state at the G20 summit in Hamburg earlier in the month .\nThe Kremlin said at the time that the two leaders had had `` an opportunity to continue their discussion during the dinner '' , but the extent of the meeting was not known .\nMr Trump left his seat and headed to Mr Putin , who had been sitting next to Mr Trump 's wife , Melania , US media said . The US president was alone with Mr Putin , apart from the attendance of the Russian president 's official interpreter .\nMr Trump had been seated next to Japanese PM Shinzo Abe 's wife , so the US interpreter at the dinner spoke Japanese , not Russian . No media were in attendance .\nGiven the poor state of relations between Washington and Moscow and the controversy surrounding Russia 's efforts to interfere with the US presidential campaign , each and every encounter between Mr Putin and Mr Trump is bound to be carefully scrutinised .\nThus the apparently impromptu discussion between the two men at the G20 dinner inevitably raises many questions . What was President Trump seeking to do in approaching the Russian president ? Were matters of substance discussed ? If so , why was no formal note taken ? And why did the US president have to rely upon a Russian official for translation ?\nThis is all highly unusual , especially at a time when relations between the two countries are laden with so many problems .\nMr Trump also appeared unaware of another dimension - the message that his tete-a-tete would send to other leaders in the room , who must have watched the US president 's gambit with some unease .\nMr Trump 's spokesperson Sarah Sanders told reporters at the White House on Wednesday that the dinner was part of the president 's publicly released schedule .\n`` You guys came and took pictures of it , '' she told journalists . `` It was n't like this was some sort of hidden dinner .

It was very animated and very friendly . ''\nNo-one else was nearby , so the topics of discussion were not known , he said .\nMr Bremmer had not been at the dinner but said details were given to him by unnamed attendees who , he said , were `` flummoxed , confused and startled '' by the turn of events .\n`` At summit meetings you have little 'pull-asides ' between heads of state to discuss business all the time - a one-hour pull-aside is highly unusual in any context , '' he told the BBC .\n`` A one-hour pull-aside between Putin and Trump where only the Kremlin translator is there , where we do n't know what 's discussed , given the uniqueness of the US-Russia relationship ... makes the [ US ] president , surprisingly and disturbingly , not credible .

ABC says that Robach ’ s 2015 interview with accuser Virginia Roberts didn ’ t have enough corroborating evidence . ( Photo by Andy Kropa/Invision/AP , File )\nNEW YORK ( AP ) — ABC News faced questions Tuesday about its reluctance to air a sensitive story of alleged sexual misconduct after a leaked video emerged of reporter Amy Robach complaining about how her bosses handled an interview with a Jeffrey Epstein accuser .\nThe conservative web site Project Veritas released video of Robach venting that “ every day I get more and more pissed ” that her 2015 interview with Virginia Giuffre never made the air . Robach made her remarks late in August while sitting in a Times Square studio with a microphone but not on the air .\nABC said Tuesday that the interview didn ’ t meet its standards because it lacked sufficient corroborating evidence . Robach , co-anchor of ABC ’ s “ 20/20 ” newsmagazine , said the leaked video caught her “ in a private moment of frustration . ”\nThe episode was remindful of Ronan Farrow ’ s accusations that NBC News discouraged his reporting on Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein ’ s misconduct . Farrow then took his Pulitzer Prize-winning story to the New Yorker magazine .\nABC sought to minimize the comparison , saying it has pursued and aired other stories about Epstein , the New York financier who died Aug. 10 while in police custody on sex trafficking charges .\nProject Veritas is known for its efforts embarrass mainstream media outlets , often sending undercover reporters to catch employees making statements that display an anti-conservative bent . But it needed no such help with the Robach video , which Project Veritas said came from an “ ABC insider ” it would not identify .\nThe correspondent was visibly exasperated as she complained that “ I tried for three years to get ( the interview ) on to no avail and now it ’ s coming out and it ’ s like these ‘ new revelations ’ and I freaking had all of it . ”\nGiuffre , whose maiden name is Roberts , alleged that as a teen , she was forced by Epstein to have sex with prominent men , including Prince Andrew . The prince and Epstein both denied the charges .\nIn the video , Robach said she was told “ who ’ s Jeffrey Epstein ? No one knows who that is . This is a stupid story . ”\nRobach also complained in the video that lawyer Alan Dershowitz and the British Royal Palace applied pressure to ABC not to air the interview with Giuffre . She suggested that the network feared that airing the interview would hurt its ability to get interviews with Prince William and Kate Middleton .\nABC denied that outside pressure had anything to do with its decision .\n“ At the time , not all of our reporting met our standards to air , but we have never stopped investigating the story , ” ABC News said in a statement Tuesday .\nGiuffre first outlined her allegations against Epstein anonymously in a lawsuit filed in 2009 , and she did her first on-the-record interviews about them with the Daily Mail in 2011 . At the time of ABC ’ s interview , Giuffre ’ s lawyers were battling with Dershowitz , who was fighting back against her claim that he was among the men who had sex with her when she was a minor .\nWhile her allegations received widespread attention , some news organizations have treated elements of her story with caution because the list of prominent men she accused was long and her allegations difficult to independently confirm .\nThe ███ doesn ’ t generally identify people who say they ’ re victims of sex assault , unless they come forward publicly as Giuffre has done .\nRobach said in her statement Tuesday that she had been referring in the video to what Giuffre had said in the interview , not what ABC News had verified through its own reporting . Corroborating evidence of the type the network sought could include interviews with people familiar with Giuffre ’ s allegations or records that would verify she was at the places the alleged sex acts took place .\n“ The interview itself , while I was disappointed it didn ’ t air , didn ’ t meet our standards , ” Robach said Tuesday . “ In the years since no one has ever told me or the team to stop reporting on Jeffrey Epstein , and we have continued to aggressively pursue this important story . ”\nABC says it plans to air a two-hour documentary and six-part podcast on the Epstein case next year .\nIt ’ s still unclear whether Robach ’ s Giuffre interview will be part of it . Now that it is four years old , it would likely need to be updated . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

( AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta )\nWASHINGTON ( AP ) — America ’ s longest war may finally be nearing an end .\nThe United States and the Islamists it toppled from power in Afghanistan are poised to sign a peace deal Saturday after a conflict that outlasted two U.S. commanders in chief and is now led by a third eager to fulfill a campaign promise to extricate America from “ endless wars . ”\nMore than 18 years since President George W. Bush ordered bombing in response to the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks , the agreement will set the stage for the withdrawal of U.S. troops , some of whom were not yet born when the World Trade Center collapsed on that crisp , sunny morning that changed how Americans see the world .\nSaturday ’ s ceremony also signals the potential end of a tremendous investment of blood and treasure . The U.S. spent more than $ 750 billion , and on all sides the war cost tens of thousands of lives lost , permanently scarred and indelibly interrupted . Yet it ’ s also a conflict that is frequently ignored by U.S. politicians and the American public .\nIn the Qatari capital of Doha , America ’ s top diplomat will stand with leaders of the Taliban , Afghanistan ’ s former rulers who harbored Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaida network as they plotted , and then celebrated , the hijackings of four airliners that were crashed into lower Manhattan , the Pentagon and a field in western Pennsylvania , killing almost 3,000 people .\nIt will likely be an uncomfortable appearance for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo , who privately told a conference of U.S. ambassadors at the State Department this week that he was going only because President Donald Trump had insisted on his participation , according to two people present .\nA statement from Trump on Friday said Pompeo will “ witness ” the signing of the agreement , leaving unclear if he will personally sign it on behalf of the United States , or if he will shake hands with Taliban representatives .\nU.S. troops are to be withdrawn to 8,600 from about 13,000 in the weeks following Saturday ’ s signing . Further drawdowns are to depend on the Taliban meeting certain counter-terrorism conditions , compliance that will be assessed by the United States . But officials say soldiers will be coming home .\nTrump , as he seeks re-election this year , is looking to make good on his campaign promise to bring troops home from the Middle East . Still , he has approached the Taliban agreement cautiously , steering clear of the crowing surrounding other major foreign policy actions , such as his talks with North Korea .\nLast September , on short notice , he called off what was to be a signing ceremony with the Taliban at Camp David after a series of new Taliban attacks . But he has since been supportive of the talks led by his special envoy , Zalmay Khalilzad .\nIn a statement released by the White House , Trump said Friday that if the Taliban and Afghan governments live up to the commitments in the agreement , “ we will have a powerful path forward to end the war in Afghanistan and bring our troops home , ”\n“ These commitments represent an important step to a lasting peace in a new Afghanistan , free from al-Qaida , ISIS and any other terrorist group that would seek to bring us harm , ” Trump said .\nUnder the agreement , the Taliban promise not to let extremists use the country as a staging ground for attacking the U.S. or its allies . But U.S. officials are loath to trust the Taliban to fulfill their obligations .\nPompeo did not mention the Afghan agreement as he touted Trump administration foreign policy achievements in a speech to a conservative group Friday . He has expressed doubts about the prospects . Yet , he will give his imprimatur to an agreement which he also has said represents “ a historic opportunity for peace ” after years and pain and suffering .\n“ We are now on the cusp of having an opportunity which may not succeed , but an opportunity for the first time to let the Afghan peoples ’ voices be heard , ” he told reporters this week .\nIf the agreement is successful , Afghanistan , the “ graveyard of empires ” that has repeatedly repelled foreign invaders from imperial Britain and Russia to the Soviet Union , will have once again successfully turned away a world power from its landlocked borders .\nBut prospects for Afghanistan ’ s future are uncertain . The agreement sets the stage for peace talks involving Afghani factions , which are likely to be complicated . Under the agreement , 5,000 Taliban are to be released from Afghan-run jails , but it ’ s not known if the Afghan government will do that . There are also questions about whether Taliban fighters loyal to various warlords will be willing to disarm .\nIt ’ s not clear what will become of gains made in women ’ s rights since the toppling of the Taliban , which had repressed women and girls under a strict brand of Sharia law . Women ’ s rights in Afghanistan had been a top concern of both the Bush and Obama administration .\nIn a sign of “ the international community ’ s commitment to Afghanistan , ” a separate ceremony will be held Saturday in the Afghan capital of Kabul , with U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg , said Sediq Sediqqui , spokesman for Afghanistan ’ s President Ashraf Ghani .\nAlready , some U.S. lawmakers and veterans of the conflict have raised red flags about any agreement with the Taliban .\nRep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming led 21 Republican legislators in demanding that the administration not concede anything to the Taliban that would allow them to once again harbor those who seek to harm U.S. citizens and interests . Cheney , the daughter of former President Bush ’ s vice president , Dick Cheney , urged Pompeo and Esper in a letter to reject any commitment to a full withdrawal of American troops .\nPompeo said , “ We ’ re proud of our gains , but our generals have determined that this war is unlikely to be won militarily without tremendous additional resources . All sides are tired of fighting . ”\nOn this , he is in rare agreement with Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts , who said this week in a Democratic presidential debate that the government has “ a sacred responsibility to ” American soldiers . “ That is not to use our military to solve problems that can not be solved militarily . We are not winning in Afghanistan . We are not winning in the Middle East , ” she said . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "19": "Donald Trump 's unannounced Christmas visit to US troops in Iraq succeeded as a morale-boosting exercise , judging from the standing ovation the president got . Equally , and perhaps predictably , the trip had its controversial moments - and his legendary attachment to social media had something to do with it .\nMr Trump travelled to al-Asad airbase , west of Baghdad , to thank armed forces personnel for what they had achieved in Iraq against Islamic State ( IS ) , the Sunni Muslim militant group , during his tenure as commander-in-chief :\n`` Two years ago when I became president they were a very dominant group , today they 're not so dominant any more . Great job . ''\n`` We 're no longer the suckers , folks , '' he said . `` We 're respected again as a nation . ''\nMr Trump was accompanied by First Lady Melania Trump on the first trip of his presidency to a war zone . The couple walked amid troops , posing for selfies and signing autographs .\nMore than 5,000 US troops remain in Iraq to train and advise local forces , who are fighting what remains of IS following a string a victories last year .\nExposure : Did smiling Navy Seals know the whole world would see their faces ?\nShortly after he left Iraqi airspace , Mr Trump proudly shared a video of what he 'd been up to during the visit .\nBut it did n't take long for eagle-eyed watchers to point out something it seemed Mr Trump and his team might have missed .\nIt appears that those in the video include an elite US Navy Seal team , according to Newsweek . A team , the magazine pointed out , which would usually have their identities protected .\nMalcolm Nance , a former US Navy intelligence specialist , told the magazine it would be a very unusual decision to picture them so clearly while on duty because , if any of them were captured , `` there would be no denying who you are and what you do '' .\nMr Trump also took a selfie with US Navy Lt Cmdr Kyu Lee , who told him he was with Seal Team Five - a fact later reported by the pool of reporters travelling with the president .\nThe White House has not commented on why they decided against taking such precautions , as some of his predecessors did .\nThe president also announced that he had secured a sizable pay increase for troops .\nSome of his advisers had suggested 2 , 3 or 4 % , he said , adding that he had made clear that this was not enough : `` I said : 'No . Make it 10 % . Make it more than 10 % . ' Because it 's been a long time , it 's been more than 10 years . ''\nBut as a number of US commentators noted , armed forces personnel have in fact received a pay rise in each of the past 10 years .\nThe increase for 2019 , approved by Congress and signed by the president in August , will be 2.6 % .\nIt is the largest rise for troops since 2010 , but not significantly more than last year 's 2.4 % .\nAny trip by a US president has to be planned down to the last detail , to make sure there are no holes in the security arrangements .\nA trip to an active war zone has to be planned with special care - and secretly .\nMr Trump was apparently very happy , regaling reporters with tales of how they had travelled with the windows closed and lights off so as not to attract any attention .\nBut unfortunately , when you are in arguably the world 's most recognisable aircraft , the chance of being spotted is always high .\nAnd on this occasion , Alan Meloy captured a perfect image of the plane soaring over Sheffield , UK , on Boxing Day .\nFrom there , Twitter sleuths and plane enthusiasts began to track the aircraft as it made its way across Europe and to Iraq , with a number of people guessing where it was headed .\nMr Trump is , of course , not the only president to travel on Air Force One on a secret visit to a warzone . His predecessors have done so .\nHowever , the fact it was quite so easy to follow what the president was doing had more than a few people concerned .\n`` Sources telling me Trump 's on his way to visit troops - possibly in Iraq . Better late than never , '' tweeted Paul Rieckhoff , founder of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America .\n`` But also a bit troubling that so many folks seem to already know about this if it has n't happened already . # OpSec anyone ? ''\nPresident Trump was due to meet Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi during the trip but the talks were cancelled over what Mr Mahdi 's office called `` disagreements '' over organisation .\nIraqi MPs told Reuters news agency that Mr Trump had asked for the meeting to take place at the al-Asad military base , an offer declined by the prime minister .\nWhen asked if he had had concerns about the visit , Mr Trump told reporters : `` Absolutely . I had concerns for the institution of the presidency - not for myself , personally . I had concerns for the first lady , I will tell you . ''\nMr Mahdi 's office said US officials had given Iraq advance notice of the presidential visit , but powerful local figures clearly took umbrage .\nSabah al-Saadi , who leads the Shia Muslim parliamentary bloc Islah , called it a `` blatant violation of Iraq 's sovereignty '' .\nQais al-Khazali , commander of Asaib Ahl al-Haqq , Iraq 's most powerful Shia Muslim militia , also objected to the trip . He warned in a tweet that parliament would respond to the visit by `` forcing the US troops to leave Iraq '' . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

It 's always been something that brings someone together , '' he said .\n`` He [ Mr Trump ] is dividing us and what I noticed over the last few months is that he 's kinda used sport to divide us and that 's something I ca n't relate to , because I know that sport was the first time I was ever around someone white . ''\nHe also argued that Mr Trump 's actions had encouraged racists , saying : `` I think [ racism 's ] always been there . But I think the president in charge now has given people - they do n't care now , they throw it to your face . ''\nOn Saturday , the president responded on Twitter by saying : `` Lebron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television , Don Lemon .\n`` He made Lebron look smart , which is n't easy to do . ''\nMr Trump also suggested that he prefers NBA legend Michael Jordan over the LA Lakers star .\nThe president 's endorsement of basketball star Michael Jordan was perhaps a reference to the long-standing debate over whether Jordan or James is the better all-time player .\nHowever , Jordan also expressed support for James . He told media outlets through his spokesperson : `` I support L.J . [ LeBron James ] . He 's doing an amazing job for his community .

    "21": "WASHINGTON/BAGHDAD/DUBAI ( ███ ) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday tempered days of angry rhetoric and suggested Iran was “ standing down ” after it fired missiles at U.S. forces in Iraq , as both sides looked to defuse a crisis over the U.S. killing of an Iranian general .\nTrump said the United States did not necessarily have to hit back after Iran ’ s attack on military bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq , itself an act of retaliation for the Jan. 3 U.S. strike that killed Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani .\nTrump said no Americans were hurt in the overnight attacks . The Pentagon said Iran had launched 16 short-range ballistic missiles , at least 11 of which hit Iraq ’ s al-Asad air base and one that hit a facility in Erbil but caused no major damage .\n“ The fact that we have this great military and equipment , however , does not mean we have to use it . We do not want to use it . American strength , both military and economic , is the best deterrent , ” Trump said .\n“ Our great American forces are prepared for anything . Iran appears to be standing down , which is a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing for the world , ” he said .\nTrump said the United States “ will immediately impose additional punishing economic sanctions on the Iranian regime ” in response to what he called “ Iranian aggression. ” He offered no specifics .\nIranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , addressing a gathering of Iranians chanting “ Death to America , ” said the missile attacks were a “ slap on the face ” of the United States and said U.S. troops should leave the region .\nForeign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif had said the strikes “ concluded ” Tehran ’ s response to the killing of Soleimani , who built up Iran ’ s network of proxy armies across the Middle East . He was buried in his hometown , Kerman , after days of national mourning .\nGRAPHIC : Iran fires missiles at U.S bases in Iraq - here\n“ We do not seek escalation or war , but will defend ourselves against any aggression , ” Zarif wrote on Twitter .\nInfluential Iraqi Shi ’ ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr , who casts himself as a nationalist rejecting both U.S. and Iranian interference in Iraq , also said the crisis Iraq was experiencing was over and he urged militia groups not to carry out attacks .\n“ I call on the Iraqi factions to be deliberate , patient , and not to start military actions , , ” said Sadr , whom Washington has long regarded as an Iranian ally .\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence told CBS News in an interview the United States was receiving “ encouraging intelligence that Iran is sending messages ” to its allied militias not to attack U.S. targets .\nBut Army General Mark Milley , chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff , said he and others in the military “ fully expect ” Shi ’ ite militia groups in Iraq , backed by Iran , to carry out attacks against U.S.-led forces in Iraq and Syria .\nTwo rockets fell on Wednesday in Baghdad ’ s heavily fortified Green Zone , causing no casualties , the Iraqi military said . There was no immediate claim of responsibility .\nIn a letter to the United Nations Security Council on Wednesday , U.S . Ambassador Kelly Craft said the killing of Soleimani was self-defense and vowed to take additional action “ as necessary ” in the Middle East to protect U.S. personnel and interests .\nThe United States also stood “ ready to engage without preconditions in serious negotiations with Iran , ” to maintain peace and security , she said .\nU.S. President Donald Trump delivers a statement about Iran flanked by U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper , Vice President Mike Pence and military leaders in the Grand Foyer at the White House in Washington , U.S. , January 8 , 2020 . ███/Kevin Lamarque\nU.S. Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans said administration officials had not provided evidence in classified briefings to back up Trump ’ s assertion that Soleimani had posed an “ imminent ” threat to the United States .\nHouse of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the Democratic-led chamber would vote on a resolution intended to limit his military actions against Iran .\nTrump ’ s address contrasted with his recent harsh rhetoric . The Republican , who was impeached in December and faces an election in November , had vowed to respond “ disproportionately ” if Iran retaliated strongly against Soleimani ’ s killing .\nOn Wednesday , Trump again vowed he would not allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon and urged world powers to quit a 2015 nuclear accord with Iran that Washington abandoned in 2018 and work for a new deal , an issue at the heart of rising tensions between Washington and Tehran . Iran has rejected new talks .\nThere was no immediate reaction from Iranian officials to Trump ’ s comments . The semi-official Fars news agency described the U.S. president ’ s remarks as a “ big retreat from threats . ”\nSoon after Wednesday ’ s attacks , Trump had said on Twitter that “ All is well ! ” and Washington was assessing damage .\nThat tweet and the comment by Iran ’ s foreign minister eased some concerns about a wider war and calmed jittery financial markets . U.S. stock prices hit record highs before paring their gains , while world oil prices , after an early spike , fell about 4 % .\nU.S. and European government sources said they believed Iran had deliberately sought to avoid U.S. military casualties in its missile strikes to prevent an escalation .\nBut an Iranian army spokesman denied “ foreign media reports ” suggesting there was some kind of coordination between Iran and the United States before the attack to evacuate bases .\nIranian television reported an official in the supreme leader ’ s office as saying the attacks were the “ weakest ” of several retaliation scenarios . It quoted another source saying Iran had lined up 100 other potential targets .\nAfter the Iranian missile attack , state television showed footage of the Soleimani burial , with hundreds of people chanting : “ God is greatest ” when the strikes were announced over loudspeakers . “ His revenge was taken and now he can rest in peace , ” Iranian television said .\nHours after the Iranian missile strike , a Ukrainian airliner crashed shortly after takeoff from Tehran on Wednesday , killing all 176 people on board . A Canadian security source said Western intelligence agencies ’ initial assessment was that the plane was not brought down by a missile . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

Pompeo spoke about Iran , Iraq , Israeli settlements in the West Bank , protests in Hong Kong , and Bolivia , among other topics . ( AP Photo/Andrew Harnik )\nWASHINGTON ( AP ) — The Trump administration on Monday said it no longer considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank to be a violation of international law , reversing four decades of American policy and further undermining the Palestinians ’ effort to gain statehood .\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that the U.S. is repudiating the 1978 State Department legal opinion that held that civilian settlements in the occupied territories are “ inconsistent with international law. ” Israeli leaders welcomed the decision while Palestinians and other nations warned that it undercut any chance of a broader peace deal .\nPompeo told reporters at the State Department that the Trump administration believes any legal questions about settlements should be resolved by Israeli courts and that declaring them a violation of international law distracts from larger efforts to negotiate a peace deal .\n“ Calling the establishment of civilian settlements inconsistent with international law has not advanced the cause of peace , ” Pompeo said . “ The hard truth is that there will never be a judicial resolution to the conflict , and arguments about who is right and who is wrong as a matter of international law will not bring peace . ”\nThe change reflects the administration ’ s embrace of a hard-line Israeli view at the expense of the Palestinian quest for statehood . Similar actions have included President Donald Trump ’ s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel ’ s capital , the movement of the U.S. Embassy to that city and the closure of the Palestinian diplomatic office in Washington .\n“ The U.S. administration has lost its credibility to play any future role in the peace process , ” said Nabil Abu Rdeneh , a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas .\nThe European Union warned of the potential repercussions in a statement following the announcement that did not mention the U.S .\n“ All settlement activity is illegal under international law and it erodes the viability of the two-state solution and the prospects for a lasting peace , ” said the statement from the 28-nation bloc . “ The EU calls on Israel to end all settlement activity , in line with its obligations as an occupying power . ”\nEven though the decision is largely symbolic , it could give a boost to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who is fighting for his political survival after failing to form a coalition government following recent elections .\nIt could also spell further trouble for the administration ’ s peace plan , which is unlikely to gather much international support by endorsing a position contrary to the global consensus .\nThe Netanyahu government was dealt a blow on settlements just last week when the European Court of Justice ruled products made in Israeli settlements must be labeled as such .\nThe 1978 legal opinion on settlements is known as the Hansell Memorandum . It had been the basis for more than 40 years of carefully worded U.S. opposition to settlement construction that had varied in its tone and strength , depending on the president ’ s position .\nThe international community overwhelmingly considers the settlements illegal based in part on the Fourth Geneva Convention , which bars an occupying power from transferring parts of its own civilian population to occupied territory .\nIn the final days of the Obama administration , the U.S. allowed the U.N. Security Council to pass a resolution declaring the settlements a “ flagrant violation ” of international law .\nPompeo said that the U.S. would not take a position on the legality of specific settlements , that the new policy would not extend beyond the West Bank and that it would not create a precedent for other territorial disputes .\nHe also said the decision did not mean the administration was prejudging the status of the West Bank in any eventual Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement .\nFor Netanyahu , the welcome boost comes at a time when he has been weakened domestically by mounting legal woes and two inconclusive elections this year .\nUnable to secure a parliamentary majority , Netanyahu is now anxiously waiting to see if his chief rival , Benny Gantz , can put together a coalition . If Gantz fails , the country could be forced into a third election , with Netanyahu facing the distraction of a trial .\nNetanyahu ’ s office released a statement saying the policy shift “ rights a historical wrong ” concerning settlements .\n“ This policy reflects an historical truth - that the Jewish people are not foreign colonialists in Judea and Samaria , ” it said , using the Israeli terms for the West Bank .\nGantz , meanwhile , applauded Pompeo ’ s “ important statement , once again demonstrating its firm stance with Israel and its commitment to the security and future of the entire Middle East . ”\nPompeo dismissed suggestions that the decision would further isolate the U.S. or Israel in the international community , though Jordan ’ s Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi wrote on Twitter that the settlements hurt peace prospects . “ We warn of the seriousness of the change in the U.S. position towards the settlements and its repercussions on all efforts to achieve peace , ” he said .\nShortly after Pompeo ’ s announcement , the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem issued an advisory warning for Americans planning to travel in the West Bank , Jerusalem and Gaza , saying , “ Individuals and groups opposed to ( Pompeo ’ s ) announcement may target U.S. government facilities , U.S. private interests , and U.S. citizens. ” It called on them “ to maintain a high level of vigilance and take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness in light of the current environment . ”\nIsrael captured the West Bank and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war and quickly began settling the newly conquered territory .\nToday , some 700,000 Israeli settlers live in the two areas , which are both claimed by the Palestinians for their state .\nAfter the war , it immediately annexed east Jerusalem , home to the holy city ’ s most important religious sites , in a move that is not internationally recognized .\nBut Israel has never annexed the West Bank , even as it has dotted the territory with scores of settlements and tiny settlement outposts .\nWhile claiming the fate of the settlements is a subject for negotiations , it has steadily expanded them . Some major settlements have over 30,000 residents , resembling small cities and serving as suburbs of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv .\nThe Palestinians and most of the world say the settlements undermine hopes for a two-state solution by gobbling up land sought by the Palestinians .\nIsrael ’ s settlement activities have also drawn attention to its treatment of Palestinians .\nWhile Jewish settlers can freely enter Israel and vote in Israeli elections , West Bank Palestinians are subject to Israeli military law , require permits to enter Israel and do not have the right to vote in Israeli elections . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

Joel Zamel , a co-founder of an Israeli consulting firm , was also in attendance .\nAlan Futerfas , Trump Jr. ’ s attorney , said on Saturday that nothing came of the meeting .\n“ Prior to the 2016 election , Donald Trump Jr. recalls a meeting with Erik Prince , George Nader and another individual who may be Joel Zamel , ” Futerfas said in an emailed statement . “ They pitched Mr. Trump Jr. on a social media platform or marketing strategy . He was not interested and that was the end of it . ”\nA company connected to Zamel also worked on a proposal for a “ covert multimillion-dollar online manipulation campaign ” to help Trump , utilizing thousands of fake social media accounts , the New York Times report said .\nThe envoy , Lebanese-American businessman George Nader , told Trump , Jr. that the crown princes of Saudi Arabia and the UAE were eager to help his father win the 2016 presidential election , the paper said .\nSince 1974 , the United States has barred foreign nationals from giving money to political campaigns and it later barred them from donating to political parties . The campaign financing laws also prohibit foreign nationals from coordinating with a campaign and from buying an ad that explicitly calls for the election or defeat of a candidate .\nThe Saudi and UAE embassies in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment .\nThe Wall Street Journal last month reported that investigators working for U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller had met with Zamel , and that Mueller ’ s team was looking into his firm ’ s work and his relationship with Nader .\nMueller is investigating whether Russia meddled in the presidential election and if Moscow colluded with the Trump campaign , as well as whether Trump committed obstruction of justice by trying to thwart the U.S. Department of Justice probe .\nTrump has denied any collusion with Russia and has called the Mueller investigation a “ witch hunt . ”\nThe New York Times report said the meetings are an indication that other countries besides Russia may have offered help to Trump ’ s presidential campaign .

    "24": "In a sweeping social policy shift , the Trump administration is seeking to remake health rules at home and abroad for women , gay and transgender people , restricting access to abortion , curtailing support for contraception and narrowing the scope of civil rights in healthcare .\nThe turnaround has its foundations in the quiet , behind-the-scenes influence of Vice President Mike Pence , who has been driven throughout his political career by his evangelical Christian beliefs to restrict abortion and prioritize the rights of religious conservatives .\nPence has been in the spotlight for leading the administration ’ s failed effort to repeal and replace Obamacare . But other changes , affecting health policy domestically and abroad , are moving ahead with far less attention .\nUnder the direction of two secretaries recommended by Pence , the Department of Health and Human Services has moved to slash funds from teen pregnancy-prevention programs , curb abortion both in the United States and abroad and strip civil protections for transgender patients .\nThe administration has emphasized abstinence programs , led by appointees who believe contraception harms women , and pushed to cut government funds for Planned Parenthood – a longtime cause for Pence while he was in Congress . Planned Parenthood , a national network of healthcare providers , offers infertility services , contraception and abortions .\nPublic health civil rights offices , marshaled to strengthen LGBT rights under Obama , have been retooled into a new Office of Conscience and Religious Freedom . This month , the office unveiled a final “ conscience rule ” to strengthen protections for healthcare workers who object to performing abortions and sterilizations or treating gay and transgender patients .\nAnd the HHS , along with the State Department – headed by Pence ally Mike Pompeo , also an evangelical Christian – has expanded the campaign beyond U.S. borders . Trump-appointed officials are seeking to delete language in international documents at the United Nations they contend promotes access to abortion and expands healthcare rights to transgender individuals .\n“ There has never been anything like it , ” Marjorie Dannenfelser , president of the Susan B. Anthony List , an anti-abortion group , said of her working relationship with Pence . “ The policy I believe can ’ t get done without Vice President Pence and his team . ”\nA cadre of religious conservatives appointed in the early days of the administration is driving the changes , largely from within HHS , which administers most government health programs , along with the State Department and White House . Many appointees come from religious and conservative groups , some of whom regularly protested outside abortion clinics during the Obama years .\nIn the Trump-Pence West Wing , “ everywhere I turn are colleagues , mentors and friends who have fought in the pro-life trenches for decades , ” Katy Talento , who handled health policy in the White House , told an anti-abortion group in Texas . She last week announced plans to leave the administration . “ I still can ’ t believe they let us all in the complex every day . ”\nEmboldened by the movement and by the new conservative majority on the Supreme Court , states including Alabama and Missouri have passed laws in recent weeks that nearly outlaw abortion , spurring nationwide protests .\nThe shift has generated legal challenges , and chunks of the agenda are bottlenecked in the courts . Recently , a federal judge in Washington State blocked new rules meant to cut funding from facilities offering abortion .\nThe campaign has been more successful abroad . Pompeo in March held a rare news conference to say the administration was strengthening an effort to combat abortion globally . “ We ’ re determined to make sure that we don ’ t allow taxpayers ’ dollars to get to those places , ” he said , citing groups performing or referring abortions , and announcing a cut in funds to Latin America .\nPompeo ’ s declaration marked an expansion of the Mexico City Policy , which requires foreign non-governmental groups that receive U.S. health aid not provide , refer or counsel on abortions . Implemented by every Republican administration since 1984 , the policy in the past applied to U.S. family planning funds , or about $ 600 million . In one of his first acts as president , Trump signed an order expanding the rule to cover nearly all U.S. global health aid , or more than $ 8 billion .\nNationally , this public health battle has often been pushed to the background by the nonstop churn of Trump ’ s tweets and controversies .\n“ One of the benefits of Trump ’ s Twitter approach is it creates headlines , and that ’ s what it ’ s intended to do , and underneath those headlines , everyone else in the administration can go about peacefully doing their job , ” said David McIntosh , president of the conservative Club for Growth and a longtime Pence friend . HHS has “ released several very important , significant regulations that changed the nature of Obamacare , of healthcare , with very little coverage in the press . ”\nThe effort has startled some public health veterans . “ It ’ s very , very extreme , ” said Megan Huchko , director of the Center for Global Reproductive Health at Duke University . “ It seems we ’ re moving backward in pretty profound ways . ”\nThe vice president declined interview requests for this article . Administration officials say his voice matters . Kellyanne Conway , senior counselor to the president , praised Pence ’ s advocacy on cutting federal support for Planned Parenthood .\n“ It means a great deal to the president to hear that from somebody who had been a legislator on Capitol Hill for 12 years , a governor for four , and somebody who like the president is trusted by the small c conservative movement as a full-spectrum conservative , ” Conway said .\nOne senior HHS official told ███ the agency is correcting the course set by the Obama administration on the government ’ s role in enforcing LGBT rights and whether providers have to perform abortions . “ Our rights to religious freedom have too long been treated as a second-class right compared to others and it ’ s time for that to change , ” said Roger Severino , director of the agency ’ s Civil Rights Division .\nWhen Trump secured the GOP nomination in 2016 , he had yet to win over skeptical evangelical voters who questioned his varying stances on critical issues , most notably abortion . Trump previously had said he supported a woman ’ s right to choose whether to terminate a pregnancy .\nHis selection of Pence as his running mate helped him win over those voters . The Trump-Pence ticket ultimately secured 80 percent of white born-again and evangelical Christians .\nIn a White House marked by turnover , the amiable Pence has been a quiet presence prodding the administration to align with his faith-based agenda . Aides describe him as a man whose effectiveness is rooted in a willingness to shun the limelight and put like-minded proteges in crucial jobs .\n“ Pence ’ s influence has come from … getting people who have the same worldview as Pence in key positions at things you care about and then trusting them to make decisions , ” said Paul Winfree , who served as deputy director of the White House Domestic Policy Council under Trump and is now at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank .\nThe vice president ’ s allies and former aides are salted throughout the administration , carrying out significant shifts in federal health insurance programs . One change cheered by the religious right made it easier for employers to not cover contraception .\nA key Pence ally is Seema Verma , a healthcare consultant who worked with him in Indiana , now administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services . Under Verma , the agency has worked to roll back Obamacare ’ s expansion of Medicaid , the insurance program for the poor and disabled that covers more than 70 million Americans .\nBoth HHS secretaries under Trump were pushed by Pence : Tom Price , an ally in Congress who was fired in 2017 for using expensive charter flights for public business , and Alex Azar , who worked as a senior pharmaceutical company executive and lobbyist in Indianapolis while Pence was governor . At a January event , Azar called Pence “ my friend and mentor . ”\nThe agency took on a new religious tone . Price hosted a Bible study on Wednesday mornings for members of Congress and political appointees , a former senior HHS official said . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

The agency ’ s top scientist called Friday ’ s release “ political ” and the head of the National Weather Service said the Alabama office “ did what any office would do to protect the public . ”\n“ My understanding is that this intervention to contradict the forecaster was not based on science but on external factors including reputation and appearance , or simply put , political , ” acting chief scientist and assistant administrator for ocean and atmospheric research Craig McLean wrote to staffers Sunday night .\nIn the email , first reported by The Washington Post , McLean said he is “ pursuing the potential violations ” of the agency ’ s science integrity policy .\nNOAA spokesman Scott Smullen said Monday , “ NOAA ’ s policies on scientific integrity and communications are among the strongest in the federal government , and get high marks from third party observers . The agency ’ s senior career leaders are free to express their opinions about matters of agency operations and science . The agency will not be providing further official comment , and will not speculate on internal reviews . ”\nMeanwhile , another career civil servant , National Weather Service Director Louis Uccellini said forecasters in Birmingham did the right thing Sept. 1 when they tried to combat public panic and rumors that Dorian posed a threat to Alabama .\n“ They did that with one thing in mind : public safety , ” said Uccellini , who prompted a standing ovation at a meeting of the National Weather Association by asking members of the Birmingham weather staff to stand .\n“ Only later , when the retweets and politically based comments started coming to their office , did they learn the sources of this information , ” he said .\nKevin Laws , science and operations officer for the weather service in Birmingham , declined comment on Uccellini ’ s remarks .\nMcLean in his letter said the Birmingham staff “ corrected any public misunderstanding in an expert and timely way as they should . There followed , last Friday , an unsigned press release from ‘ NOAA ’ that inappropriately and incorrectly contradicted the NWS forecaster . ”\nMcLean said that the NOAA Scientific Integrity Policy tells all agency employees to “ approach all scientific activities with honesty , objectively , and completely , without allegiance to individuals , organizations , or ideology . ”\nHe said the Friday NOAA press release “ compromises the ability of NOAA to convey life-saving information ” and “ violated NOAA ’ s policies of scientific integrity . ”\nThe policy said employees should not “ intimidate or coerce employees , contractors , recipients of financial assistance awards , or others to alter or censor scientific findings . ”\nThe scientific integrity policy is not criminal and has no punishments , said former NOAA general counsel and deputy administrator Monica Medina , who served in the Barack Obama and Bill Clinton administrations . She praised McLean and Uccellini “ for looking into the matter and holding their current leadership accountable . ”\nAt the National Weather Association ’ s annual meeting , members including its president , signed two posters supporting the hurricane center and Birmingham office .\n“ We make forecasts , we don ’ t deal with politics , ” said association president Paul Schlatter , who works for the weather service in Boulder , Colorado . “ Our job is to protect the American public with the weather information we pass around . Of course , it ’ s frustrating when things get politicized and we are the scientists and the communicators that are delivering the message for weather safety . ”\nTrump has defended his Sept. 1 tweet that said Hurricane Dorian would threaten Alabama .

    "26": "WASHINGTON ( ███ ) - President Donald Trump on Friday dropped his choice of John Ratcliffe to be U.S. spy chief after questions arose about the congressman ’ s lack of experience and possible exaggerations in his resume , marking the latest upheaval over a top national security post .\nTrump announced the move five days after he surprised many in Washington by making the conservative Republican lawmaker from Texas his selection to replace Daniel Coats as director of national intelligence , a post that oversees the 17 U.S. civilian and military intelligence agencies including the CIA .\nAccording to a source familiar with the situation , Trump is considering Republican Representatives Michael McCaul and Devin Nunes for the job . McCaul is a former chairman of the House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee and Nunes is a former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee .\nTrump told reporters at the White House he has “ a list of three people ” he will consider for the job this weekend . The Republican president blamed unflattering news coverage for Ratcliffe ’ s decision to bow out and instead remain in the House . Ratcliffe , 53 , faced a potentially difficult Senate confirmation process .\nThe vacancy comes as the U.S. intelligence community grapples with an array of challenges , including the threat of foreign interference in next year ’ s U.S. elections , the impact of a rising China , escalating tensions with Iran , North Korea ’ s nuclear program and the desire to end years of conflict in Afghanistan , Iraq and Syria .\nTrump announced last Sunday that Coats , who had clashed with him over assessments involving Russia , Iran and North Korea , will step down on Aug. 15 .\nRatcliffe , a Trump loyalist and the most junior member of the House Intelligence Committee , had been tapped , but not formally nominated , to replace Coats .\n“ Rather than going through months of slander and libel , I explained to John how miserable it would be for him and his family to deal with these people , ” Trump said on Twitter .\nThe change in leadership at the top of the U.S. intelligence community comes after a half-year of turmoil atop the Pentagon . The Senate on July 23 confirmed Army Secretary Mark Esper as defense secretary , ending the longest period that the Pentagon had been without a permanent top official , a stint that began after James Mattis resigned in December over policy differences with Trump .\nTrump ’ s previous pick for defense secretary , Patrick Shanahan , withdrew in June after reports of domestic violence in his family .\nThe post of director of national intelligence was created after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks on the United States .\nRatcliffe , confirming he had withdrawn from consideration , said he thought the confirmation process would become a partisan battle between Republicans and Democrats .\n“ I do not wish for a national security and intelligence debate surrounding my confirmation , however untrue , to become a purely political and partisan issue , ” Ratcliffe said .\nRatcliffe gained attention by defending Trump and criticizing former Special Counsel Robert Mueller during a July hearing on Mueller ’ s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election .\nAlthough Ratcliffe had touted his counter-terrorism experience as a federal prosecutor in Texas , media outlets including ███ reported on concerns that he may have exaggerated his achievements in the post .\nDemocratic lawmakers and some former senior U.S. intelligence officers had said Ratcliffe lacked the expertise and experience to replace Coats . Some voiced concern that he would warp U.S. intelligence to support Trump ’ s views . Ratcliffe served for six months on the intelligence panel .\nTrump said he might name the No . 2 intelligence official , Sue Gordon , as acting director of national intelligence . That is required when there is a vacancy in the top job . Such a move would likely be reassuring to many U.S. intelligence experts because of her deep experience .\nHowever , some Trump allies , according to the source familiar with the matter , were floating the possibility of instead naming CIA Director Gina Haspel as acting director until a permanent director is confirmed by the Senate .\nSenate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr said while he was “ heartened ” that the office of the director of national intelligence has an experienced team in place during the transition , “ there is no substitute for having a Senate-confirmed director in place ” leading it .\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer , a critic of Ratcliffe for the job , said in a statement , “ The next Director of National Intelligence must be someone who is nonpartisan , sees the world objectively and speaks truth to power . ”\nU.S. President Donald Trump talks to reporters as he departs for travel to Bedminster , New Jersey from the South Lawn of the White House in Washington , U.S. , August 2 , 2019 . ███/Leah Millis\nRatcliffe joined a growing list of Trump ’ s choices for senior jobs who have had to withdraw , leading to questions about the rigorousness of White House background checks .\nAsked whether Ratcliffe ’ s history was inadequately reviewed before he was picked , Trump defended the White House process .

    "27": "WASHINGTON ( ███ ) - President Donald Trump ’ s personal attorney , Rudy Giuliani , was paid $ 500,000 for work he did for a company co-founded by the Ukrainian-American businessman arrested last week on campaign finance charges , Giuliani told ███ on Monday .\nThe businessman , Lev Parnas , is a close associate of Giuliani and was involved in his effort to investigate Trump ’ s political rival , former Vice President Joe Biden , who is a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic Party nomination .\nGiuliani said Parnas ’ company , Boca Raton-based Fraud Guarantee , whose website says it aims to help clients “ reduce and mitigate fraud ” , engaged Giuliani Partners , a management and security consulting firm , around August 2018 . Giuliani said he was hired to consult on Fraud Guarantee ’ s technologies and provide legal advice on regulatory issues .\nFederal prosecutors are “ examining Giuliani ’ s interactions ” with Parnas and another Giuliani associate , Igor Fruman , who was also indicted on campaign finance charges , a law enforcement source told ███ on Sunday .\nThe New York Times reported last week that Parnas had told associates he paid Giuliani hundreds of thousands of dollars for what Giuliani said was business and legal advice . Giuliani said for the first time on Monday that the total amount was $ 500,000 .\nGiuliani told ███ the money came in two payments made within weeks of each other . He said he could not recall the dates of the payments . He said most of the work he did for Fraud Guarantee was completed in 2018 but that he had been doing follow-up for over a year .\nParnas and Fruman were arrested at Dulles Airport outside Washington last week on charges they funneled foreign money to unnamed U.S. politicians in a bid to influence U.S.-Ukraine relations in violation of U.S. campaign finance laws . The men were preparing to board a plane to Europe .\nAccording to an indictment unsealed by U.S. prosecutors , an unidentified Russian businessman arranged for two $ 500,000 wires to be sent from foreign bank accounts to a U.S. account controlled by Fruman in September and October 2018 . The money was used , in part , by Fruman , Parnas and two other men charged in the indictment to gain influence with U.S. politicians and candidates , the indictment said .\nForeign nationals are prohibited from making contributions and other expenditures in connection with U.S. elections , and from making contributions in someone else ’ s name .\nGiuliani said he was confident that the money he received was from “ a domestic source , ” but he would not say where it came from .\n“ I know beyond any doubt the source of the money is not any questionable source , ” he told ███ in an interview . “ The money did not come from foreigners . I can rule that out 100 % , ” he said .\nHe declined to say whether the money had been paid directly to him by Fraud Guarantee or from another source .\nJohn Dowd , a lawyer for Parnas and Fruman , also would not discuss the source of the funding that Giuliani said he received for his work for Fraud Guarantee . “ What I know is privileged , ” Dowd said . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

In an extraordinary act of solidarity with NASCAR ’ s only Black driver , dozens of drivers pushed the car belonging to Bubba Wallace to the front of the field before Monday ’ s race as FBI agents nearby tried to find out who left a noose in his garage stall over the weekend . ( AP Photo/John Bazemore )\nBubba Wallace steered the No . 43 to the front of pit road , NASCAR champion Kyle Busch pushing the famous car on one side and close friend Ryan Blaney pushing on the other .\nThe entire 40-driver field and their crew members followed . After the car came to a stop , Wallace climbed out , sat on the window ledge and sobbed . Richard Petty , his Hall of Fame team owner , gently placed a hand on Wallace ’ s shoulder .\nAs federal authorities descended on Talladega Superspeedway on Monday to investigate the discovery of a noose in Wallace ’ s garage stall , the entire industry rallied around the Cup Series ’ only Black driver .\n“ The news has disturbed us all and of course we want justice and know who and why , ” said seven-time NASCAR champion Jimmie Johnson . “ And we want to stand with our friend . ”\nThe 82-year-old Petty , at his first race since the coronavirus pandemic began and at Talladega on race day for the first time in more than 10 years , stood side by side with Wallace during the national anthem before Monday ’ s rain-postponed event . Everyone stood behind the car while Brad Keselowski held the American flag at the front of the display of solidarity .\nThe idea to stand with Wallace started with Johnson , while former series champion Kevin Harvick suggested they all push the car to the front of the grid , Wallace said .\nOne by one , after the anthem , they hugged Wallace . He then had a long embrace with Petty .\nIf not for a shortage of fuel , Wallace might have had a chance to race for the win . A late stop for gas led to a 14th-place finish but felt like a win for Wallace . He went to the fence and slapped hands through the wiring with a group of fans , many wearing “ I Can ’ t Breathe ” shirts as they cheered .\nHe apologized for not wearing a mandatory mask but didn ’ t put it on because “ I wanted to show whoever it was , you are not going to take away my smile . ”\n“ This sport is changing , ” he said . “ The pre-race deal was probably one of the hardest things I ’ ve ever had to witness in my life . From all the supporters , from drivers to crew members , everybody here , the bad-ass fan base , thank you guys for coming out . This is truly incredible and I ’ m glad to be a part of this sport . ”\nIt was Wallace who successfully pushed the stock car series to ban the Confederate flag at its venues less than two weeks ago and he was the target when the noose was found hanging in the Richard Petty Motorsports garage stall Sunday afternoon at the Alabama track . A member of Wallace ’ s crew reported it to NASCAR , and by Monday morning U.S. Attorney Jay Town said his office , the FBI and the Justice Department ’ s Civil Rights Division were involved .\n“ Regardless of whether federal charges can be brought , this type of action has no place in our society , ” Town said .\nNASCAR President Steve Phelps said security has been stepped up for Wallace — his team was also granted unusual access to its car Monday morning to ensure it had not been tampered with overnight — and the FBI was “ currently on site ” at the track .\nHe said the FBI director had told agents in Birmingham to “ use all their resources ” to find the perpetrator .\n“ Unequivocally they will be banned from this sport for life , ” Phelps said . “ There is no room for this at all . We won ’ t tolerate it . They won ’ t be here . I don ’ t care who they are , they will not be here . ”\nNASCAR has tried to distance itself from the Confederate flag for years at the risk of alienating a core group of its fan base . At Wallace ’ s urging , it went ahead with the ban as the nation grapples with social unrest largely tied to George Floyd , an unarmed Black man who died in the custody of Minneapolis police .\nNASCAR has not outlined how it will enforce the restriction and this week ’ s race at Talladega , in the heart of the South , presented the series with its biggest test in the early going . Disgruntled fans with Confederate flags drove past the main entrance to the track all weekend and a plane flew above the track Sunday pulling a banner of the flag that read “ Defund NASCAR . ”\nAlabama Gov . Kay Ivey said she was “ shocked and appalled ” by the “ vile act ” against Wallace .\n“ There is no place for this disgusting display of hatred in our state , ” Ivey said . “ Bubba Wallace is one of us ; he is a native of Mobile and on behalf of all Alabamians , I apologize to Bubba Wallace as well as to his family and friends for the hurt this has caused and regret the mark this leaves on our state . ”\nPetty said in a statement he was “ enraged ” by the “ filthy act ” of racism . Retired champion Jeff Gordon called it a “ cowardly ” act while retired champion and current team owner Tony Stewart seethed in a social media post : “ Angry . Outraged . Disappointed . Those words don ’ t fully describe how I feel . # IStandWithBubba and I ’ ll damn sure stand up to anyone who engages in this kind of behavior . ”\nPhelps said he was the one who told Wallace about the noose .\n“ It was a difficult moment for Bubba , a difficult moment for me , ” he said . “ He ’ s handled it with the grace that he has handled everything that ’ s happened over the last few weeks . ”\nThe 26-year-old Wallace said after the noose was discovered : “ T his will not break me , I will not give in nor will I back down . I will continue to proudly stand for what I believe in . ”\nWallace has previously worn a shirt that says “ I Can ’ t Breathe ” over his firesuit and sported a Black Lives Matter paint scheme in a race last month in Martinsville , Virginia .\nTalladega is one of the more raucous stops on the NASCAR schedule , but the pandemic prompted the series , like all sports , to ban or sharply limit fans . Up to 5,000 fans were allowed in , but there were far fewer than that Monday and none of them had access to the the infield or the Cup Series garage .\nUnder strict new health guidelines , a very limited number of people can access the garage . That would include crew members for each of the 40 teams , NASCAR employees , Talladega staff members and any contracted safety crews or security guards .\nPhelps declined to discuss whether cameras in the garage area might have captured anything of value but noted NASCAR has an approved list of who is allowed access that has been turned over to authorities .\n“ It will be part of what the FBI is looking at , ” he said \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "29": "ALEXANDRIA , Va. ( ███ ) - In a break with convention , President Donald Trump weighed in on a criminal trial as the jury considered a verdict on Friday , calling the tax and bank fraud case against Paul Manafort “ very sad ” and lauding his former campaign chairman as a “ very good person . ”\nA federal court jury in Alexandria , Virginia completed its second day of deliberations without reaching a verdict in the first trial stemming from Special Counsel Robert Mueller ’ s 15-month-old investigation of Russia ’ s role in the 2016 U.S. election .\nU.S. District Judge T.S . Ellis , presiding over the case , said he personally had received threats related to the trial and was being protected by U.S. marshals .\nEllis revealed the threats as he rejected a motion by a group of news organizations to make public the names of the jurors , saying he was concerned about their “ peace and safety . ”\n“ I had no idea this case would excite these emotions ... I don ’ t feel right if I release their names , ” the judge said .\nIn remarks to reporters at the White House , Trump again called Mueller ’ s investigation , which had cast a cloud over his presidency , a “ rigged witch hunt , ” but sidestepped a question about whether he would issue a presidential pardon for Manafort .\nRelated Coverage Manafort jury breaks for weekend without reaching a verdict\n“ I think the whole Manafort trial is very sad , when you look at what ’ s going on there . I think it ’ s a very sad day for our country , ” Trump said .\n“ He worked for me for a very short period of time . But you know what ? He happens to be a very good person . And I think it ’ s very sad what they ’ ve done to Paul Manafort . ”\nTrump made his comments while the jurors , mulling 18 criminal counts against Manafort , deliberated behind closed doors on Friday morning .\nAs president , Trump has the power to pardon Manafort on the federal charges . He has already issued a number of pardons , including for a political ally , former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio . Asked by a reporter on Friday if he would pardon Manafort , Trump said , “ I don ’ t talk about that now . ”\nThe jurors are not sequestered but have been instructed not to watch news reports or talk to others about the case . Deliberations by the six women and six men in the jury were set to resume on Monday morning .\nProsecutors accused Manafort , 69 , of hiding from U.S. tax authorities $ 16 million in money he earned as a political consultant for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine to fund an opulent lifestyle and then lying to banks to secure $ 20 million in loans after his Ukrainian income dried up and he needed cash .\nManafort faces five counts of filing false tax returns , four counts of failing to disclose his offshore bank accounts and nine counts of bank fraud . If convicted on all counts , he could spend the rest of his life in prison .\nThe charges largely predate Manafort ’ s five months working on Trump ’ s campaign during a pivotal period in the 2016 presidential race , including three months as campaign chairman .\nIt is unusual for a U.S. president to comment about the character of a defendant in an ongoing trial and criticize the legal proceedings . It was not the first time Trump has weighed in since Manafort ’ s trial began on July 31 . On the first day of testimony , Trump said Manafort had been treated worse than 1920s gangster Al Capone .\nTrump has made previous comments criticizing various federal judges and courts and has been harshly critical of Mueller , a former FBI director who is investigating whether Trump ’ s campaign colluded with Russia , an allegation the president and Moscow deny .\nOn Friday , he accused Mueller of having “ a lot of conflicts , ” but said the special counsel should be allowed to finish a report on his investigation .\nProhibitions on jurors reading about a case they are deciding are difficult to enforce in the smartphone era , Cornell University criminal law professor Jens David Ohlin said .\n“ We trust jurors to be on their best behavior and wall themselves off but that kind of goes against human nature , ” Ohlin said .\n“ I think it was very ill-advised for the president to do this . He should have kept his mouth shut , ” Ohlin added .\nThe prosecution could request a mistrial , but such a maneuver was very unlikely , Ohlin said .\nThe jury sent a note on Thursday afternoon asking Ellis four questions including one about defining “ reasonable doubt. ” In a criminal case , a jury must find a defendant guilty “ beyond a reasonable doubt . ” \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

( Matthew Hendrickson/Chicago Sun-Times via AP )\nCHICAGO ( AP ) — Chicago parents and community groups are scrambling to prepare for a massive teachers ’ strike set to begin Thursday , prompting the city to preemptively cancel classes in the nation ’ s third-largest school district .\nThe Chicago Teachers Union confirmed Wednesday night that its 25,000 members would not return to their classrooms Thursday after months of negotiation between the union and Chicago Public Schools failed to resolve disputes over pay and benefits , class size and teacher preparation time .\nThe strike is Chicago ’ s first major walkout by teachers since 2012 and city officials announced early Wednesday that all classes had been canceled for Thursday in hopes of giving more planning time to the parents of more than 300,000 students .\n“ We want this to be a short strike with an agreement that will benefit our schools and our teachers . We have a ways to go , ” Chicago Teachers Union President Jesse Sharkey said during a union news conference . “ We actually want to see improvement on all the issues we are talking about here . ”\nMayor Lori Lightfoot said she was disappointed by the union ’ s decision to strike .\n“ We are offering a historic package on the core issues — salary , staffing and class size , ” she said Wednesday night at her own news conference , adding that school district negotiators will remain at the bargaining table and that she hopes the union does , too .\nDuring the 2012 strike , the district kept some schools open for half days during a seven-day walkout . District officials said this time they will keep all buildings open during school hours , staffed by principals and employees who usually work in administrative roles .\nBreakfast and lunch will be served , but all after-school activities and school buses are suspended in the district serving more than 300,000 students .\nJanice Jackson , the district ’ s CEO , encouraged parents to send their children to the school that they normally attend , however they will be welcome in any district schools .\n“ We ’ ve put together a really comprehensive plan for the students , ” Jackson said . “ We will make sure they are safe and they have a productive day . ”\nAlso striking will be 7,000 support staffers , whose union also failed to reach a contract agreement .\nBefore the strike announcement , June Davis said if teachers walked out , she would likely send her 7-year-old son , Joshua , to his usual elementary school — Smyth Elementary on the city ’ s South Side where almost all students are low-income and minority .\nDavis , 38 , said she would otherwise have to take her son to his grandmother ’ s in a southern suburb , requiring an hourlong trip on a regional bus line .\n“ Everybody ’ s hoping they will come to some kind of agreement , find some compromise , ” Davis said .\nLightfoot preemptively announced that classes on Thursday would be canceled , saying she wanted to give parents more time to plan . A clearly frustrated Lightfoot said the city had not only offered a 16 % pay raise over the five-year contract , but the city also had agreed to put language in the contract addressing “ enforceable targets ” on class size and increasing staffing levels for positions such as nurses , librarians and social workers — items the union said were critical .\nShe said the union ’ s demands would cost an unaffordable $ 2.5 billion per year .\nUnion leaders disputed Lightfoot ’ s characterization of the city ’ s willingness to concede to their demands on several issues , including class sizes .\n“ CPS ’ current class size offer falls far short of what ’ s needed to address the sweeping scale of the problem , ” they said in a statement .\nLightfoot said the city agreed to make substantial changes on some of the union ’ s top priorities , but its negotiators responded by issuing additional demands , including some she deemed unacceptable .\n“ The union is still demanding to shorten instructional time by 30 minutes in the morning , ” she said . “ We won ’ t do that . We will not cheat our children out of instructional time . ”\nBefore heading into a downtown law firm for bargaining talks Wednesday morning , union vice president Stacy Davis Gates said there is a “ gross disconnect ” between Lightfoot ’ s comments and what negotiators have put in writing .\n“ To say that you have offered a proposal that respects what we are asking for , to say you ’ ve bent over backward ... it ’ s absolutely ridiculous , ” Davis Gates said .\nCommunity organizations have been preparing for days to welcome students , ranging from a $ 100 per day camp for elementary school kids at the Shedd Aquarium to all-day programs run by the Boys & Girls Club of Chicago and accessible for a $ 20 annual membership fee .\nMimi LeClair , president of the Boys & Girls Club of Chicago , said a strike is particularly difficult for single parents and those whose jobs have inflexible schedules .\n“ It ’ s a horrendous dilemma , deciding between likely losing their job or having their paycheck docked when they rely on every penny or leaving their children home alone , ” LeClair said .\nThe city ’ s public libraries also are planning programs for students , along with a network of churches and community centers that are part of the city ’ s Safe Haven program intended to give kids a safe place during the summer months particularly on the city ’ s South and West sides .\nThe YMCA of Metro Chicago expects highest demand for its all-day programs for children between the ages of 5 and 12 , who are too young to stay home alone but whose parents may oppose sending them to schools unstaffed by teachers .\n“ Real life still happens , ” said Man-Yee Lee , a spokeswoman for the organization . “ Parents still need to go to work and their kids still need somewhere to go . ” \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

The agencies have had the Democratic document for days , he said .\n“ We also want to make sure that the White House doesn ’ t redact our memo for political purposes and obviously that ’ s a deep concern , ” Schiff said .\nRepresentative Devin Nunes , the committee ’ s Republican chairman who commissioned the Republican memo , declined comment .\nRepresentative Mike Conaway , a senior committee Republican , said he wanted the Democratic memo released but did not know how he would respond if Trump sought to block it .\nHouse rules could let Democrats request an unusual closed vote in the full House of Representatives on whether to override the president if Trump opposes the memo ’ s release .\nHouse intelligence is one of three congressional committees looking into the matter , along with Mueller .\nTrump , who denies collusion between his campaign and Moscow , and has dismissed the Russia probes as a witch hunt , used social media to express his views on the memos .\nTrump took to Twitter on Saturday to say the Republican memo vindicated him , and used more tweets on Monday to praise Nunes as a hero and accuse Schiff of leaking “ confidential ” material . Schiff responded by warning Trump against “ tweeting false smears . ”\nThe White House said it was open to releasing the Democratic memo once it goes through a security review . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "32": "The US military will send an additional 1,000 troops to the Middle East as tensions build with Iran .\nActing Defence Secretary Patrick Shanahan said the deployment was in response to `` hostile behaviour '' by Iranian forces .\nThe US Navy also shared new images it says link Iran to attacks last week on two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman .\nWashington has accused Iran of blowing holes in the vessels with mines . Iran has denied the allegations .\nTensions were further fuelled on Monday when Iran said its stockpile of low-enriched uranium would next week exceed levels set under the 2015 nuclear agreement .\nIt recently stepped up production in response to the US tightening sanctions . The 2015 deal , from which the US has withdrawn , curbed Iran 's nuclear programme in exchange for the lifting of sanctions .\nIran 's President Hassan Rouhani said his country did not seek to wage war with any nation and had remained `` loyal '' to its international obligations .\nOvernight three rockets hit a military base housing US troops north of Baghdad , the Iraqi military said . The US said it was `` indirect fire '' and did not cause injuries .\nNo group said it had carried out the attack , though it followed US warnings of an increased threat to US interests in Iraq by Iranian-backed militias .\nAnnouncing the deployment , Mr Shanahan said the US did `` not seek conflict with Iran '' but the action had been taken to `` ensure the safety and welfare of our military personnel working throughout the region to protect our national interests '' .\nHe said the military would continue to monitor the situation and make adjustments to troop levels accordingly .\nThe 1,000 additional troops being despatched to the Middle East is presented as a prudent defensive measure by the Pentagon ; the recent attacks on the two oil tankers being taken as a clear sign of Iran 's hostile intent .\nThey join some 1,500 additional troops sent last month . Taken together , these deployments inevitably raise tensions but they are clearly not in any sense an assault force .\nIf direct conflict does break out between Washington and Tehran , it will most likely be a sporadic air and maritime battle , not a land campaign .\nBut what worries Washington is attacks by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps or Iran 's proxies against US troops or facilities in the wider region - hence this latest deployment .\nThe US defence secretary is again insisting that Washington does not want conflict with Tehran , but tensions remain high and any miscalculation could lead to a serious escalation .\nShortly before the announcement , the Pentagon released new images including some purporting to show the remnants of an unexploded mine on the Japanese-owned oil tanker damaged in the attacks .\nThe photos appear to show it being removed by members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps . The Pentagon has already released grainy video said to show the same episode .\nAlso seen in the latest images is apparent damage - a hole - above the waterline on the hull of the Kokuka Courageous .\nAnother image is said to show the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps vessel shortly after it was involved in removing the limpet mine .\nThe other tanker damaged in the attacks was the Norwegian-owned Front Altair .\nThe US has implicated Iran in the latest attacks and four others outside the Strait of Hormuz in May , allegations denied by Iran .\nChina urged the US to lower the pressure and for Iran to stick to the nuclear deal , warning of a `` Pandora 's box '' in the region .\nRussia - another party to the nuclear accord - also called for restraint , calling US actions `` truly provocative '' .\nSaudi Arabia also blames Iran for the attacks on the two oil tankers , while the UK said it was `` almost certain '' Iran was behind the blasts .\nBut EU foreign ministers meeting on Monday warned against jumping to conclusions and backed UN calls for an independent investigation .\nIn 2015 , Iran agreed to a landmark deal with world powers to curb its nuclear development .\nIt agreed to limit the enrichment of uranium , which is used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons , and other measures in return for relief from sanctions .\nMr Trump abandoned the nuclear accord last year and started to re-impose sanctions .\nThe move has crippled Iran 's economy , which relies on oil , and Iran has responded by scaling back its nuclear commitments .\nSpeaking on Iranian TV , President Rouhani said the international community could see that it was the US , not Iran , that was acting badly .\n`` Iran has been loyal to its signature , '' he said . `` Iran has been loyal to international agreements , and the one standing against us today [ the US ] is the one that has trampled all pacts , agreements and international accords .

    "33": "On Monday morning Paul Manafort and business associate Rick Gates were charged with 12 counts of money laundering , undisclosed foreign lobbying , lying to government investigators , and various and sundry other serious-sounding offences .\nIt turned out that was n't the biggest news of the day .\nIndictments had been telegraphed since news reports on Friday evening mentioned they were signed , sealed and soon-to-be-delivered . Manafort 's name was at the top of most lists of possible targets . It was the follow-up revelation from Robert Mueller 's independent counsel team , however , that caught most of Washington by surprise .\nGeorge Papadopoulos - hardly a household name - had pleaded guilty to lying to FBI investigators about his contacts with Russian nationals and connected individuals while he was serving as a foreign policy with the Trump campaign .\nWhere the Manafort indictment was somewhat expected and covered business dealings prior to his time as head of the Trump campaign , the Papadopoulos news sits at the heart of Mr Mueller 's investigation into possible Trump team collusion with Russia .\nHere are three reasons why Papadopoulos is a key piece of the puzzle . And lest we give the Manafort case short shrift , here are three more reasons why it could end up being even more explosive .\nPer details of the indictment and plea agreement , Papadopoulos has revealed that he was in contact with individuals - a London professor , a female Russian national , a Russian foreign affairs ministry official - either directly or tangentially connected to the Russian government .\nHe was passing along details of conversations he had to senior members of the Trump presidential campaign team including , reportedly , Manafort . At one point , a `` campaign supervisor '' , responding to one of Papadopoulos 's emails , replied `` good work '' .\nWhile not evidence of collusion , this is clear indication that the Russian government was seeking back channels to the Trump campaign - and were finding at least some success .\nThe White House has diminished Papadopoulos 's role within the campaign , noting he was an unpaid adviser and that his efforts to set up a senior-level meeting between the Trump team and Russian officials were rebuffed .\nPapadopoulos did have a sit-down conference on 31 March 2016 , with Mr Trump and the rest of the foreign policy team . Candidate Trump also mentioned Papadopoulos , whom he called an `` excellent guy '' , as an adviser in a 21 March interview with the Washington Post .\nPapadopoulos may have been on the campaign periphery , but he was far from a total unknown .\nOn April 26 , 2016 , Papadopoulos 's professor contact told him he had just returned from Moscow and learned from `` high-level Russian government officials '' that they possessed `` dirt '' on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in the form of `` thousands of emails '' .\nIt 's unclear from the indictment whether Papadopoulos passed this bit of information on to his campaign contacts , although it notes he `` continued to correspond '' with them .\nWhat is clear , however , is that there is now evidence that individuals with Russian government connections on two separate occasions tried to let the Trump campaign know that they had information they thought was damaging to the Democratic candidate .\nPapadopoulos was the first . The second was when the president 's eldest son , Donald Trump Jr , heard a similar line from his publicist-friend Rob Goldstone in June 2016 .\nTrump Jr responded by writing `` if it 's what you say I love it especially later in the summer '' . Later that month , Trump Jr , Manafort and Donald Trump 's son-in-law , Jared Kushner , met a group of Russian nationals .\nIn July , embarrassing emails that were hacked from the Democratic National Committee were published by Wikileaks . In October , the contents of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta 's personal email inbox were released .\nIf there 's anyone in Trump 's campaign circle with something to hide , they should be concerned that Papadopoulos was arrested back on 27 July . He struck a plea agreement with the Mueller team on 5 October .\nThat was nearly four weeks ago and , according to the court documents , Papadopoulos has been co-operating with government investigators ever since . In fact , Mr Mueller told the relevant court he did not want the arrest made public because it would `` significantly undermine his ability to serve as a proactive co-operator '' .\nSo who has Papadopoulos spoken to since his arrest ? And what sorts of topics could he have discussed ?\nAccording to Dan Dale of the Toronto Star , a former prosecutor told him the term `` proactive co-operator '' can indicate someone who is willing to wear a wire tap .\nHotAir Blog goes through an extended what-if scenario that envisions how Papadopoulos could go about surreptitiously gathering incriminating details from members of Trump 's campaign inner circle . He could ask for their `` advice '' on how to disrupt Mr Mueller 's investigation after disclosing that he had been arrested .\n`` Suddenly those people woke up this morning and realised they 'd had conversations with Papadopoulos recently about how to throw Mueller off the trail and only now do they realise he 's been in cahoots with Mueller for three months , '' the theory goes . `` Hoo boy . ''\nEven if , as Mr Trump writes in a tweet , Manafort 's alleged illegal activities occurred `` years ago '' , before he took a senior position in the Trump campaign , it still reflects poorly on the then-candidate 's personnel choices .\nIt was clear at the time Manafort came on board with Mr Trump that he had some questionable dealings in his past - including work for pro-Russian Ukrainian politicians , Philippine ex-leader Ferdinand Marcos and a group with ties to Pakistani intelligence .\nLike many politicos in Mr Trump 's orbit , Manafort was thrust into the campaign spotlight with little background vetting because more established hands wanted nothing to do with the upstart candidate 's presidential efforts .\nThe decision to run with Manafort , who was backed by Trump confidante Roger Stone , has come back to haunt his presidency .\nPart of the case against Manafort - that he was operating as an undisclosed agent for a foreign government - echoes similar allegations made against another Trump associate , former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn .\nFlynn resigned his White House post after revelations that he had lied about discussing US sanctions with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak in December 2016 . It was later disclosed that Flynn was also working for the Turkish government - something he did n't disclose on his relevant government forms .\nIf Manafort can face charges for his Ukrainian involvement , Flynn may be in jeopardy as well .\nSlate 's Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern also theorise that Mr Mueller 's case against Manafort for financial misdeeds relating to foreign income could serve as a blueprint for a future case against Mr Trump 's own business organisation , which also brings in a fair amount of revenue from foreign sources .\n`` This is an indictment that should terrify Trump in that it shadows and hints at his own unlawful conduct , '' they write .\nMr Trump was n't named in the Manafort indictment , but the message may have been sent nevertheless .\nThen there 's the million-dollar question . If Manafort and Gates are each staring at double-digit prison terms if convicted , might they follow Papadopoulos 's lead and seek to strike a deal with Mr Mueller in exchange for leniency ?\nPapadopoulos , of course , is a figure from the edges of the Trump campaign . Manafort , for months , was at the heart of it .\nMr Mueller and his veteran team of prosecutors know how to build a case against a large enterprise . Start with the easy targets , then offer a deal . Work your way up from the bottom . Reward those who co-operate early , and throw the book at the hold-outs . Turn the screws , and have your targets constantly looking over their shoulders .\nManafort and Gates may have nothing to bargain with - the White House insists that there is nothing there . If they do , however , this rollercoaster ride is only just beginning . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

Chris Stewart is offering a proposal on Friday , Dec. 6 , 2019 that aims to achieve both goals . ( AP Photo/J . Scott Applewhite , File )\nAs Democrats champion anti-discrimination protections for the LGBTQ community and Republicans counter with worries about safeguarding religious freedom , one congressional Republican is offering a proposal on Friday that aims to achieve both goals .\nThe bill that Utah GOP Rep. Chris Stewart plans to unveil would shield LGBTQ individuals from discrimination in employment , housing , education , and other public services — while also carving out exemptions for religious organizations to act based on beliefs that may exclude those of different sexual orientations or gender identities . Stewart ’ s bill counts support from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Seventh-day Adventist Church , but it has yet to win a backer among House Democrats who unanimously supported a more expansive LGBTQ rights measure in May .\nBut the uphill climb for his plan doesn ’ t daunt Stewart , who sees the bill as a way to “ bridge that gap ” between preventing discrimination and allowing religion to inform individual decisions .\n“ I don ’ t know many people who wake up and say ‘ I want to discriminate ’ . Most people find that offensive , ” Stewart told The ███ . “ There are people who , and I ’ m included among them , have religious convictions that put them in a bind about how to reconcile those two principles . ”\nThe Utah lawmaker ’ s legislation comes as the Supreme Court prepares to rule on cases that touch squarely on the issue of employment discrimination against LGBTQ people , who currently do not receive specific protection in federal civil rights laws . While 21 states have laws that bar employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity , Democrats in Congress and running for president are pushing for a federal statute that would provide broader protections .\nBut that more sweeping bill ’ s chances of passage are low unless Democrats take back full control of Congress as well as the White House , given President Donald Trump ’ s opposition and Republican critics who warn of a risk to religious freedom . That prospect has informed Stewart and outside groups ’ work on a proposal to enshrine rights for the LGBTQ community while also preserving the right for religious groups to act in accordance with their faiths .\nAmong other faith-based exemptions to anti-discrimination protections in the bill is an allowance for religious groups such as churches and schools to employ those who align with their internal guidelines , according to a summary provided in advance of its release . The bill also would prohibit religious groups that oppose same-sex marriage from having their tax-exempt status revoked .\n“ We have taken back the religious liberty principle from extremists who I think do want to do harm to LGBTQ people and minority rights , ” said Tyler Deaton , a senior adviser to the American Unity Fund , a nonprofit supporting Stewart ’ s bill that seeks to build conservative support for LGBTQ rights . Deaton added that some religious conservative groups who were consulted on the bill ultimately chose not to endorse it .\nDespite that resistance from some on the right , Stewart ’ s bill sparked sharp criticism from progressives who decry its exemptions as large enough to enable ongoing mistreatment of LGBTQ individuals .\n“ We need to address the real and pervasive problem that is discrimination against LGBTQ people , and everyone should come to the table to address the problem , ” said Laura Durso , a vice president at the left-leaning Center for American Progress . “ But what we can not do is treat LGBTQ people as second-class citizens by creating carve-outs that enable discrimination . ”\n███ religion coverage receives support from the Lilly Endowment through the Religion News Foundation .

    "35": "New York 's attorney general is suing the Trump Foundation , as well as Donald Trump and his children , alleging `` extensive and persistent '' lawbreaking .\nBarbara Underwood said the charitable foundation had engaged in `` unlawful political co-ordination '' designed to influence the 2016 election .\nThe lawsuit seeks to dissolve the foundation and $ 2.8m ( £2.1m ) in restitution .\nThe president hit back at the lawsuit on Twitter , saying that `` sleazy New York Democrats '' were `` doing everything they can to sue me '' . He vowed he would not settle the case .\nThe attorney general is also seeking to bar the president and three of his adult children , Donald Jr , Eric and Ivanka , from serving on the board of any New York-based charity , `` in light of misconduct and total lack of oversight '' .\nShe has referred the case to the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Election Commission , she says .\nMs Underwood filed a petition at the New York Supreme Court in Manhattan on Thursday , Mr Trump 's 72nd birthday .\nIt accuses the foundation and its directors - Mr Trump and his three eldest children - of unlawfully co-ordinating with the Trump presidential campaign , repeated self-dealing transactions , and violating laws under which non-profit organisations must operate .\nIn a statement , Ms Underwood said Mr Trump had illegally instructed the foundation to provide support to his presidential campaign by using the foundation 's name and funds it raised to promote the campaign .\nThe petition also claims that Mr Trump used charitable assets to pay off legal obligations , to promote his own businesses and to purchase personal items , including a painting of himself .\nThe Trump Foundation issued a statement denying the charges and accusing the attorney general of holding its $ 1.7 million in remaining funds `` hostage for political gain '' .\nThe lawsuit announced on Thursday is the culmination of a two-year investigation , which began under the previous New York attorney general , Eric Schneiderman , Ms Underwood said .\nMr Schneiderman resigned last month after several former girlfriends accused him of physical abuse .\nIn October 2016 Mr Schneiderman ordered the Trump Foundation to stop fundraising in New York , after finding it had no proper registration .\nPresident-elect Trump vowed to shut the charitable foundation down in December 2016 , to avoid `` even the appearance '' of any conflict of interest .\nThe Trump Foundation lawsuit adds to Mr Trump 's legal challenges , which include a wide-ranging special counsel investigation into alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russia . Special Counsel Robert Mueller has indicted several of Mr Trump 's associates and raided the home and office of the president 's long-time lawyer and fixer , Michael Cohen .\nNew York Attorney General Barbara Underwood has opened a new front in the ongoing criminal investigations into Donald Trump and his empire . Allegations of misdeeds connected to the Trump Foundation had swirled during the 2016 presidential elections , but the topic had been overshadowed during the early days of the Trump presidency . That may be about to change .\nAdministration officials , from the president on down , will certainly attempt to brand this as yet another politically motivated investigation of an ideological adversary - new witches but the same hunt .\nNevertheless , as New York Attorney General , Ms Underwood has significant investigatory and prosecutorial power , and if she starts looking into some of Mr Trump 's more questionable charitable activities , there 's no telling what she might turn up .\nAt the very least , it appears the Trump world 's celebrations of former Attorney General Eric Schneiderman 's disgrace were a bit premature . Ms Underwood may not be as outspokenly anti-Trump as her predecessor , but she appears to be equally - or more - aggressive where it counts , in the courtroom .\nThursday 's 41-page document filed with the NY Supreme Court spells out a range of alleged violations of laws concerning non-profit organisations , dating back more than a decade .\nThe investigation apparently found that the foundation was `` little more than an empty shell that functions with no oversight by its board of directors '' . The board had not met since 1999 , despite being legally required to meet annually , and did not oversee the foundation 's activities `` in any way '' , the document says .\nMr Trump , who has not contributed any personal funds to the foundation since 2008 , was the sole signatory on the foundation 's bank accounts and approved all of its grants .\nSeveral pages of the document focus on a charity fundraiser for veterans in Iowa in January 2016 , which Mr Trump chose to hold instead of taking part in a TV debate with other Republican presidential hopefuls ahead of the influential state 's caucuses .\nMore than $ 2.8m was donated to the Trump Foundation at that event . The petition alleges that those funds raised from the public were used to promote Mr Trump 's campaign for the presidency , in particular in the Iowa nominating caucuses .\nThe lawsuit also claims that the foundation paid $ 100,000 ( £75,000 ) to settle legal claims against Mr Trump 's Mar-A-Lago resort , $ 158,000 to settle claims against one of his golf clubs , and $ 10,000 to purchase a painting of Mr Trump to hang at another of his golf clubs .\nThe purchase of the painting was an example of one of `` at least five self-dealing transactions '' which violate tax regulations on non-profit charities , the statement said .\n`` As our investigation reveals , the Trump Foundation was little more than a cheque book for payments from Mr Trump or his businesses to nonprofits , regardless of their purpose of legality , '' Ms Underwood said . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

    "37": "ALEXANDRIA , Va. ( ███ ) - Prosecutors portrayed U.S. President Donald Trump ’ s onetime campaign chairman Paul Manafort as a tax cheat who used offshore accounts to hide tens of millions of dollars from political work in Ukraine , as the first trial from a probe into Russia ’ s meddling in the 2016 election got off to a quick start on Tuesday .\nManafort lived an extravagant lifestyle , snapping up expensive homes and cars , and spending more than half a million dollars on “ fancy clothes ” and $ 21,000 for a watch , a prosecutor said in the government ’ s opening statement at the trial in a Virginia federal court .\n“ A man in this courtroom believed the law did not apply to him . Not tax , not banking law , ” said Uzo Asonye , a member of Special Counsel Robert Mueller ’ s team looking at possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign in 2016 .\nIn describing the 18 counts facing Manafort , Asonye said that Manafort did not pay taxes on a large portion of the $ 60 million he earned working for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine , hid the income in a web of 30 overseas bank accounts , and lied to U.S. banks to borrow millions of dollars against his real estate holdings once the money from Ukraine dried up .\n“ All of these charges boil down to one simple issue : that Paul Manafort lied , ” Asonye said .\nManafort ’ s attorney Thomas Zehnle painted a drastically different portrait of Manafort , calling him a successful political consultant of 40 years who left the day-to-day operations of his company to his former associate Rick Gates , who betrayed him .\nZehnle made it clear that attacking the credibility of Gates , who pleaded guilty in February and agreed to cooperate with Mueller ’ s investigation , would be a central plank of the defense .\nGates is expected to be a star witness at the trial .\n“ Rick Gates had his hand in the cookie jar , ” Zehnle said , claiming that Gates was not truthful with the accountants who prepared Manafort ’ s tax returns and kept his name on offshore accounts to conceal an embezzlement scheme .\nThomas Green , who represents Gates , did not respond to a request for comment on the new accusations .\nThe government also presented its first witness , Tad Devine , a political consultant who recalled his work with Manafort in Ukraine to help pro-Russian political figure Viktor Yanukovych , who was swept from power and fled to Russia in 2014 .\nDevine , a strategist on Democrat Bernie Sanders 2016 presidential campaign , described how Manafort used Western-style polling and advertising to lift Yanukovych to victory in a 2010 election . Prosecutors appeared to be using his testimony to establish the nature of Manafort ’ s work in Ukraine .\nDevine was also asked about Konstantin Kilimnik , a Russian-Ukranian political consultant who he described as a translator for Manafort . Kilimnik , who prosecutors have said has ties to Russian intelligence , was indicted last month along with Manafort on charges of witness tampering .\nFormer Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort is shown in a court room sketch , as he sits in federal court on the opening day of his trial on bank and tax fraud charges stemming from Special Counsel Robert Mueller 's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election , in Alexandria , Virginia , U.S. July 31 , 2018 . ███/Bill Hennessy\nOutside the courthouse , a handful of protesters displayed a life-sized puppet of Trump and held signs saying , “ Trump won ’ t do time for you , ” “ It ’ s Mueller time , ” and “ I like your new suit ” alongside a photo of Manafort ’ s mug shot .\nA Manafort conviction would give momentum to Mueller , who has indicted or secured guilty pleas from 32 people and three companies since his probe started 14 months ago . An acquittal would support efforts by Trump and his allies to portray the investigation as a “ witch hunt . ”\nTrump has denied that his campaign colluded with Russia , and on Tuesday tried to make the case publicly that collusion would not be a crime anyway .\nProsecutors have said they would not present evidence of collusion at this trial . The charges against Manafort largely pre-date his five months of work for the Trump campaign , some of them as campaign chairman .\nTrump has vacillated between showing sympathy for Manafort and trying to distance himself .\nManafort attended a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russians that is a focal point of Mueller ’ s probe .\nEarlier in the day , U.S. District Judge T.S . Ellis presided over selection of a 12-member jury , six men and six women .\nManafort , 69 , was wearing a black suit , white shirt and a tie .

Jacob John said before the wholesale lockdown was announced on Tuesday that India was being forced to take extreme containment measures after failing to mitigate the problem earlier on , when the caseload was light .\n“ There would have been time because the wolf was not yet at the door .

( AP Photo/Steve Helber , file )\nRICHMOND , Va. ( AP ) — Virginia Gov . Ralph Northam announced Tuesday that he ’ s making Juneteenth — a day that commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S. — an official holiday in a state that was once home to the capital of the Confederacy .\nJuneteenth , which is also called Emancipation Day and Freedom Day , is celebrated annually on June 19 . Texas first made it a state holiday in 1980 . The holiday would be a paid day off for all state employees . Northam said he thinks Virginia would be only the second state to do so .\n“ It ’ s time we elevate this , ” Northam said of the June 19 commemoration . “ Not just a celebration by and for some Virginians but one acknowledged and celebrated by all of us . ”\nThe Democratic governor is giving every executive branch employee this Friday off as a paid holiday and will work with the legislature later this year to pass a law codifying Juneteenth as a permanent state holiday . The legislation is likely to pass the Democratic-controlled legislature with little trouble .\nThe holiday commemorates June 19 , 1865 , when news finally reached African Americans in Texas that President Abraham Lincoln had issued the Emancipation Proclamation freeing slaves living in Confederate states two years earlier . When Union soldiers arrived in Galveston to bring the news that slavery had been abolished , former slaves celebrated .\nThe announcement came less than two weeks after Northam announced he was ordering the removal of a statue of Gen. Robert E. Lee along Richmond ’ s prominent Monument Avenue . It is one of the country ’ s most iconic monuments to the Confederacy . Earlier this year , Northam signed legislation scrapping Lee-Jackson Day , a state holiday named after two Confederate generals .\nNearly forced from office last year after a racist yearbook photo surfaced , Northam has won widespread praise among black lawmakers for his actions in Virginia following the death of George Floyd , a black man who died after a Minneapolis officer pressed his knee into Floyd ’ s neck as he pleaded for air .\nPresident Donald Trump announced last week that he has rescheduled a campaign rally that was planned in Tulsa , Oklahoma , on Juneteenth . The announcement of the rally had sparked an outcry because Tulsa was the site of one of the worst instances of racial violence in U.S. history in 1921 , when hundreds of African Americans were massacred by a white mob that burned black-owned businesses and homes .\nNortham was joined Tuesday at his news conference by musician Pharrell Williams , who is from Virginia . Williams said Juneteenth deserves the same level of recognition and celebration as Independence Day .\n“ Here ’ s our day , and if you love us , it ’ ll be your day too , ” Williams said .\nIn a statement , state House Republican Leader Todd Gilbert echoed the same sentiments .\n“ July 4th is the birthday of our nation , but Juneteenth is the day where it truly began to fulfill its promise of freedom for all , ” Gilbert said . “ For the first time since enslaved Africans landed at Jamestown in 1619 , the chains of bondage were finally cast off . ”\nJoseph Rogers , a 29-year-old activist who has been a regular protester in Richmond during more than two weeks of demonstrations over Floyd ’ s killing , hailed Northam ’ s announcement . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

The federal deficit for the 2019 budget year is expected to have soared to near $ 1 trillion , up more than $ 200 billion from last year and the largest such gap in seven years . ( AP Photo/Patrick Semansky )\nWASHINGTON ( AP ) — The Trump administration reported a river of red ink Friday .\nThe federal deficit for the 2019 budget year surged 26 % from 2018 to $ 984.4 billion — its highest point in seven years . The gap is widely expected to top $ 1 trillion in the current budget year and likely remain there for the next decade .\nThe year-over-year widening in the deficit reflected such factors as revenue lost from the 2017 Trump tax cut and a budget deal that added billions in spending for military and domestic programs .\nForecasts by the Trump administration and the Congressional Budget Office project that the deficit will top $ 1 trillion in the 2020 budget year , which began Oct. 1 . And the CBO estimates that the deficit will stay above $ 1 trillion over the next decade .\nThose projections stand in contrast to President Donald Trump ’ s campaign promises that even with revenue lost initially from his tax cuts , he could eliminate the budget deficit with cuts in spending and increased growth generated by the tax cuts .\nHere are some questions and answers about the current state of the government ’ s finances .\nThe deficit has been rising every year for the past four years . It ’ s a stretch of widening deficits not seen since the early 1980s , when the deficit exploded with President Ronald Reagan ’ s big tax cut .\nFor 2019 , revenues grew 4 % . But spending jumped at twice that rate , reflecting a deal that Trump reached with Congress in early 2018 to boost spending .\nFiscal hawks have long warned of the economic dangers of running big government deficits . Yet the apocalypse they fear never seems to happen , and the government just keeps on spending .\nThere have been numerous attempts by presidents after Reagan to control spending . President George H.W . Bush actually agreed to a tax increase to control deficits when he was in office , breaking his “ Read my lips ” pledge not to raise taxes .\nAnd a standoff between President Bill Clinton and House Speaker Newt Gingrich did produce a rare string of four years of budget surpluses from 1998 through 2001 . In fact , the budget picture was so bright when George W. Bush took office in 2001 that the Congressional Budget Office projected that the government would run surpluses of $ 5.6 trillion over the next decade .\nThat didn ’ t happen . The economy slid into a mild recession , Bush pushed through a big tax cut and the war on terrorism sent military spending surging . Then the 2008 financial crisis erupted and triggered a devastating recession . The downturn produced the economy ’ s first round of trillion-dollar deficits under President Barack Obama and is expected to do so again under Trump .\nAs far as most of us can tell , the huge deficits don ’ t seem to threaten the economy or elevate the interest rates we pay on credit cards , mortgages and car loans . And in fact , the huge deficits are coinciding with a period of ultra-low rates rather than the surging borrowing costs that economists had warned would likely occur if government deficits got this high .\nThere is even a new school of economic theory known as the “ modern monetary theory. ” It argues that such major economies as the United States and Japan don ’ t need to worry about running deficits because their central banks can print as much money as they need .\nYet this remains a distinctly minority view among economists . Most still believe that while the huge deficits are not an immediate threat , at some point they will become a big problem . They will crowd out borrowing by consumers and businesses and elevate interest rates to levels that ignite a recession .\nWhat ’ s more , the interest payments on the deficits become part of a mounting government debt that must be repaid and could depress economic growth in coming years . In fact , even with low rates this year , the government ’ s interest payments on the debt were one of the fastest growing items in the budget , rising nearly 16 % to $ 375.6 billion .\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell says the day of reckoning is still coming but isn ’ t here yet . Most analysts think any real solution will involve a combination of higher taxes and cost savings in the government ’ s huge benefit programs of Social Security and Medicare .\nANY SIGN THAT WASHINGTON MAY TAKE THE POLITICALLY PAINFUL STEPS TO CUT THE DEFICIT ?\nIn short , no . There has been a major change since the first round of trillion-dollar deficits prompted the Tea Party revolt . This shift brought Republicans back into power in the House and incited a round of fighting between GOP congressional leaders and the Obama administration . A result was government shutdowns and near-defaults on the national debt .\nBut once Trump took office , things changed : The president focused on his biggest legislative achievement , the $ 1.5 trillion tax cut passed in 2017 . This appeared to satisfy Republican lawmakers and quelled concerns about rising deficits .\nDemocratic presidential candidates have for the most part pledged to roll back Trump ’ s tax cuts for corporations and wealthy individuals . But they would use the money not to lower the deficits but for increased spending on expensive programs such as Medicare for All .\nIt doesn ’ t seem likely , though former Rep. Mark Sanford , who has mounted a long-shot Republican campaign against Trump , is urging Republican voters to return to their historic concerns about the high deficits .\nAnd economists note that today ’ s huge deficits are occurring when the economy is in a record-long economic expansion . This is unlike the previous stretch of trillion-dollar deficits , which coincided with the worst recession since the 1930s .\nBut analysts warn that if the economy does go into a recession , the huge deficits projected now will expand significantly — possibly to a size that would send interest rates surging . Such a development , if it sparked worries about the stability of the U.S. financial system , might produce the type of deficit crisis they have been warning about for so long . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

Government aid my simply be too little too late . ( AP Photo/Paul Sancya , File )\nNEW YORK ( AP ) — The billions of dollars in coronavirus relief targeted at small businesses may not prevent many of them from ending up in bankruptcy court .\nBusiness filings under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law rose sharply in March , and attorneys who work with struggling companies are seeing signs that more owners are contemplating the possibility of bankruptcy .\nCompanies forced to close or curtail business due to government attempts to stop the virus ’ s spread have mounting debts and uncertain prospects for returning to normal operations . Even those owners receiving emergency loans and grants aren ’ t sure that help will be enough .\nThe most vulnerable companies include the thousands of restaurants and retailers that shut down , many of them more than a month ago . Some restaurants have managed to bring in a bit of revenue by serving meals for takeout and delivery , but even they are struggling financially . Small and independent retailers , including those with online stores . are similarly at risk ; clothing retailers have the added problem of winter inventory that they are unlikely to sell with spring here and summer approaching .\nIndependent oil companies whose revenue was slammed by the collapse in energy prices also are strapped , as are other companies that were already burdened with high debt levels before the virus struck .\nJennifer Bennett , who closed one of her San Francisco restaurants on Wednesday , was still waiting for the financial aid she sought from the federal , state and city governments . Even with the money , she doesn ’ t know if the revenue will cover the bills when she ’ s finally able to reopen Zazie — especially if she ’ s required to space tables six feet apart for social distancing .\n“ Our occupancy is going to be cut 60 % to 65 % , ” Bennett says . “ I fear bankruptcy is a possibility . ”\nOther small companies have similar anxieties , says Paul Singerman , a bankruptcy attorney with Berger Singerman in Miami .\n“ There is no reliable visibility into when business operations will be able to resume the pre-COVID normal , ” Singerman says .\nEven larger companies are in trouble , including already struggling retailers who had to shut their stores .\nThe jeans company True Religion filed for Chapter 11 earlier this month , saying extended closures of its stores in the pandemic have hurt its business . Recent reports say department store chains Neiman Marcus and J.C. Penney , which has struggled for years with slumping sales , could soon file for bankruptcy protection .\nThe number of Chapter 11 filings rose 18 percent in March from a year earlier , a dramatic swing from the 20 percent decrease in February , according to the American Bankruptcy Institute , a trade organization for attorneys and other professionals involved in bankruptcy proceedings . The numbers don ’ t break out filings by company size , but given that the vast majority of companies are small to mid-size , it does give an indication that smaller companies are struggling .\nThe federal government has already approved or given out more than 2 million loans and grants to small businesses totaling nearly $ 360 billion ; another $ 310 billion is on the way to one of the programs . Still , the money may be at best a stopgap for companies with little to no revenue coming in . And the new funds are expected to go so quickly that thousands of owners won ’ t get loans .\nThere ’ s no way to predict how many companies will file for bankruptcy . There were over 160,000 bankruptcy filings from 2008 to 2010 , during the Great Recession and its aftermath , according to statistics compiled by the federal court system . The numbers don ’ t break out filings by company size . The majority were for liquidations . although some companies restructured their debt and continued operating under Chapter 11 .\nMany companies , however , just shut their doors , and that ’ s likely to be the case again , Singerman says . According to some estimates , 170,000 companies failed during the recession .\nBut the Small Business Reorganization Act , which took effect in February , may encourage more companies to seek Chapter 11 . The law is aimed at allowing owners to retain their ownership rather than lose their companies to their creditors ; that is generally what happens in Chapter 11 . The law also streamlines the reorganization process so a company is not wiped out by attorneys ’ fees , says Edward Janger , a professor at Brooklyn Law School in New York whose expertise includes bankruptcy law .\nAnother change under the law is that a bankruptcy judge can approve the reorganization over creditors ’ objections , Janger says .\nBusiness owners will try to avoid bankruptcy by seeking leniency from landlords , lenders and vendors , bankruptcy attorney David Wander says . But with their companies ’ financial troubles beyond their control because of the virus outbreak , many will file for Chapter 11 because the stigma that bankruptcy has long held will be gone , says Wander , a partner at Davidoff Hutcher & Citron in New York .\n“ The tsunami is going to happen in the coming months and it ’ s going to be ongoing , ” Wander says . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

Fearful that the documents might be used against American Media , Pecker and the company ’ s chief content officer , Dylan Howard , removed them from the safe in the weeks before Trump ’ s inauguration , according to one person directly familiar with the events .\nIt was unclear whether the documents were destroyed or simply were moved to a location known to fewer people .\nJerry George , a longtime Enquirer reporter who left the publication in 2013 , said the practice of catch and kill took root at the Enquirer under Pecker . Though George had no personal knowledge of Trump-specific catch and kills , he said that AMI generally paid hush money only if it believed it had something to gain .\n“ It ’ s ‘ I did this for you , ’ now what can you do for me , ” George said . “ They always got something in return . ”\nCatch and kills were loathed by the National Enquirer ’ s reporters , he said , because they robbed the publication of juicy stories .\nAmerican Media did not immediately respond to a request for comment .\nPecker ’ s immunity deal was first reported Thursday by Vanity Fair and The Wall Street Journal , citing anonymous sources . Vanity Fair reported that Howard also was granted immunity .\nCourt papers in the Cohen case say Pecker “ offered to help deal with negative stories about ( Trump ’ s ) relationships with women by , among other things , assisting the campaign in identifying such stories so they could be purchased and their publication avoided . ”\nThe Journal reported Pecker shared with prosecutors details about payments that Cohen says Trump directed in the weeks and months before the election to buy the silence of McDougal and another woman alleging an affair , porn star Stormy Daniels . Daniels was paid $ 130,000 , and McDougal was paid $ 150,000 .\nWhile Trump denies the affairs , his account of his knowledge of the payments has shifted . In April , Trump denied he knew anything about the Daniels payment . He told Fox News in an interview aired Thursday that he knew about payments “ later on . ”\nIn July , Cohen released an audio tape in which he and Trump discussed plans to buy McDougal ’ s story from the Enquirer . Such a purchase was necessary , they suggested , to prevent Trump from having to permanently rely on a tight relationship with the tabloid .\n“ You never know where that company — you never know what he ’ s gon na be — ” Cohen says .\nWhile Pecker is cooperating with federal prosecutors now , American Media previously declined to participate in congressional inquiries .\nLast March , in response to a letter from a group of House Democrats about the Daniels and McDougal payments , American Media general counsel Cameron Stracher declined to provide any documents , writing that the company was “ exempt ” from U.S. campaign finance laws because it is a news publisher and it was “ confident ” it had complied with all tax laws . He also rebuffed any suggestion that America Media Inc. , or AMI , had leverage over the president because of its catch-and-kill practices .\n“ AMI states unequivocally that any suggestion that it would seek to ‘ extort ’ the President of the United States through the exercise of its editorial discretion is outrageous , offensive , and wholly without merit , ” Stracher wrote in a letter obtained by The ███ .\nFormer Enquirer employees who spoke to the AP said that negative stories about Trump were dead on arrival dating back more than a decade when he starred on NBC ’ s reality show “ The Apprentice . ”\nIn 2010 , at Cohen ’ s urging , the National Enquirer began promoting a potential Trump presidential candidacy , referring readers to a pro-Trump website Cohen helped create . With Cohen ’ s involvement , the publication began questioning President Barack Obama ’ s birthplace and American citizenship in print , an effort that Trump promoted for several years , former staffers said .\nThe Enquirer endorsed Trump for president in 2016 , the first time it had ever officially backed a candidate . In the news pages , Trump ’ s coverage was so favorable that the New Yorker magazine said the Enquirer embraced him “ with sycophantic fervor . ”\nPositive headlines for Trump , a Republican , were matched by negative stories about his opponents , including Hillary Clinton , a Democrat : An Enquirer front page from 2015 said “ Hillary : 6 Months to Live ” and accompanied the headline with a picture of an unsmiling Clinton with bags under her eyes . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "48": "ALEXANDRIA , Va. ( ███ ) - U.S. prosecutors on Monday rested their case against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort after 10 days of testimony alleging how he evaded taxes and defrauded banks , with the defense set to decide on Tuesday if it will call any witnesses .\nAs its final witness on Monday , the prosecution recalled a Treasury Department agent who testified that Manafort ’ s consulting companies did not disclose their foreign bank accounts , as is required by law , in addition to him failing to do so personally .\n“ The government rests , ” U.S. prosecutor Greg Andres said after the agent completed her testimony .\nJudge T.S . Ellis said he would talk to Manafort on Tuesday about whether he wanted to take the stand , something that legal experts say is highly unlikely .\nManafort ’ s lawyers will also tell the court on Tuesday whether they plan to call any witnesses .\nIf the defense rests , closing statements would be next , after which the 12-person jury will begin deliberations .\nManafort is being tried on 18 counts , which include tax and bank fraud charges , as well the failure to disclose foreign bank accounts . If found guilty on all charges , he could face eight to 10 years in prison , according to sentencing expert Justin Paperny .\nThe trial is the first courtroom test for U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller , who indicted Manafort in October 2017 as part of his probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election .\nManafort ’ s lawyers on Monday asked for the charges to be thrown out , claiming that the prosecution failed to show the necessary willfulness to break the law .\nDan Goldman , a former federal prosecutor who attended the proceedings , called the action by Manafort ’ s lawyers “ pro-forma ” , adding , “ very rarely are they successful . ”\nDuring the trial , more than two dozen witnesses took the stand and portrayed Manafort , 69 , as a lavish spender with little regard for the law . As a political consultant for pro-Kremlin politicians in the Ukraine , Manafort earned some $ 60 million between 2010 and 2014 .\nStashing the money in 31 offshore bank accounts , he skirted taxes by wiring it directly to vendors to snap up real estate and luxury goods , the witnesses said .\nThe trappings of Manafort ’ s lifestyle dominated media headlines throughout the trial : there was half a million dollars worth of antique rugs , $ 750,000 spent on landscaping for his $ 13 million Bridgehampton mansion , and more than $ 1 million for clothing , including a $ 15,000 jacket made of ostrich skin .\nEllis closed the courtroom at the end of the day to hear arguments on a sealed motion that was filed earlier in the day .\nWhile the contents of the motion are unknown , the development comes after an unexplained delay in the trial and unusually detailed instructions by Ellis to the jurors on Friday , in which he pressed them not to talk to anyone about the case .\nThe judge ’ s comments sparked speculation by legal experts and courtroom observers that the delay could be related to some form of juror misconduct . Ellis resumed testimony mid-afternoon on Friday with no changes to the jury .\n“ The fact that the judge resumed proceedings but gave a strong admonishment to the jury tells me that a juror issue arose but that level of misconduct was not significant enough to warrant a mistrial , ” said jury consultant Alexandra Rudolph .\nThe prosecution also called James Brennan to the stand on Monday . Brenann is an executive at Federal Savings Bank , which extended $ 16 million in loans to Manafort on his Hamptons estate and a Brooklyn brownstone house in late 2016 and early 2017 .\nBrennan said bank president Javier Ubarri made an initial decision to reject a $ 9.5 million loan on Manafort ’ s Hamptons estate , but bank chief executive Steve Calk overruled it . “ It closed because Mr. Calk wanted it to close , ” Brennan said about the loan .\nOn Friday , another Federal employee testified that Calk personally approved loans to Manafort while seeking Manafort ’ s help getting a job in President Donald Trump ’ s campaign and his cabinet .\nFederal Savings Bank has not returned calls seeking comment , and has said it will make no comment during Manafort ’ s trial .\nBrennan , asked about whether the bank made money from lending to Manafort , said the bank has written off the loans and “ took a hit ” of $ 11.8 million . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

Guyger shot and killed Botham Jean , an unarmed 26-year-old neighbor in his own apartment last year . She told police she thought his apartment was her own and that he was an intruder . ( Tom Fox/The Dallas Morning News via AP , Pool )\nDALLAS ( AP ) — A prosecutor on Monday dismissed as garbage a former Dallas police officer ’ s claim that she believed she was in her own apartment when she fatally shot a neighbor in his home .\nAssistant District Attorney Jason Fine used his closing argument to describe Amber Guyger as “ an intruder ” who killed Botham Jean in his apartment — one floor above hers — last September .\nGuyger tearfully testified last week that she mistook Jean ’ s apartment for her own after a long shift . Speaking publicly for the first time about the events of that night , she said she found the door of what she believed was her apartment unlocked and was afraid that someone had broken in . She said she feared for her life and opened fire using her service weapon when a silhouetted figure walked toward her in the dark .\n“ Most of what she said was garbage , ” Fine said Monday .\nDefense attorney Toby Shook said Monday that Guyger made “ a series of horrible mistakes ” that were entirely understandable . He noted that other residents have also gone to the wrong apartments in that complex after parking on the wrong floor .\nLead prosecutor Jason Hermus said Guyger should have known she was outside the wrong apartment — at which point she drew her gun — because of the distinctive bright red doormat that lay at the entrance to Jean ’ s home .\n“ You can ’ t miss this , ” he said , holding it up for jurors .\nAnd even if she missed the obvious signs that this wasn ’ t her home , Guyger should have retreated and called for backup when she found the door unlocked , instead of forging forward and opening fire , Hermus said .\n“ For Amber Guyger , Mr. Jean was dead before that door ever opened , ” he said .\n“ It sounds so absurd — all of the things that she missed and all of the things that she thought , ” Fine said .\nThe jury can find Guyger guilty of murder , manslaughter or no crime . They deliberated Monday afternoon until 5 p.m. and were expected to resume at 8:30 a.m. Tuesday .\nIn her testimony Friday , the 31-year-old Guyger , who is white , repeatedly apologized for killing Jean , a black accountant from the Caribbean island nation of St. Lucia who lived a floor above her .\n“ I hate that I have to live with this every single day of my life and I ask God for forgiveness , and I hate myself every single day , ” she said as she looked across the courtroom at Jean ’ s family .\nProsecutors said Jean was unarmed and eating a bowl of vanilla ice cream in his living room when Guyger killed him .\nGuyger was arrested on a manslaughter charge three days after the killing . She was later fired and charged with murder .\nLee Merritt , an attorney for Jean ’ s family , said the evidence proved Guyger is guilty and that the jury will have to weigh whether Jean ’ s life mattered . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

( AP Photo/Michael Conroy )\nTERRE HAUTE , Ind . ( AP ) — A judge on Wednesday halted the execution of a man , said to be suffering from dementia , who was set to die by lethal injection in the federal government ’ s second execution this week after a 17-year hiatus .\nWesley Ira Purkey , convicted of a gruesome 1998 kidnapping and killing , was scheduled to die at the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute , Indiana , where Daniel Lewis Lee was put to death Tuesday after his eleventh-hour legal bids failed .\nU.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan in Washington , D.C. , imposed two injunctions prohibiting the federal Bureau of Prisons from moving forward with Purkey ’ s execution , but the Justice Department immediately appealed . An appeals court panel kept in place both injunctions in orders Wednesday evening . Appeals to the Supreme Court were still pending .\nIt all suggested a volley of litigation would continue into the evening , similar to what happened before the government executed Lee following a ruling from the Supreme Court . One of the injunctions imposed Wednesday would halt not only Purkey ’ s execution , but another that has been scheduled for Friday and one in August .\nEarlier Wednesday , the Supreme Court ended a separate stay by the 7th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago .\nLee , convicted of killing an Arkansas family in a 1990s plot to build a whites-only nation , was the first of four condemned men scheduled to die in July and August despite the coronavirus pandemic raging inside and outside prisons .\n“ This competency issue is a very strong issue on paper , ” said Robert Dunham , executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center . “ The Supreme Court has halted executions on this issue in the past . At a minimum , the question of whether Purkey dies is going to go down to the last minute . ”\nJudge Chutkan didn ’ t rule on whether Purkey was competent but said the court needed to evaluate the claim . She said there was no question he ’ d suffer “ irreparable harm ” if he was put to death before his claim could be evaluated .\nLee ’ s execution had gone forward a day late . It was scheduled for Monday afternoon , but the Supreme Court only gave the green light in a 5-4 ruling early Tuesday .\nRepeatedly on Wednesday , a federal judge also denied a request from Dustin Lee Honken , an Iowa drug kingpin scheduled to be executed on Friday , to delay his execution . The judge said he would not delay Honken ’ s execution due to the coronavirus pandemic and said the Bureau of Prisons was in the best position to weigh the health risks .\nThe issue of Purkey ’ s mental health arose in the runup to his 2003 trial and when jurors had to decide whether he should be put to death in the killing of 16-year-old Jennifer Long in Kansas City , Missouri . Prosecutors said he raped and stabbed her , dismembered her with a chainsaw , burned the body and dumped her ashes in a pond in Kansas . Purkey was separately convicted and sentenced to life in the beating death of 80-year-old Mary Ruth Bales , of Kansas City , Kansas .\nBut the legal questions of whether he was mentally fit then are different from whether he ’ s fit now to be put to death . Purkey ’ s lawyers argue he clearly isn ’ t , saying in recent filings he suffers from advancing Alzheimer ’ s disease .\n“ He has long accepted responsibility for the crime that put him on death row , ” one of his lawyers , Rebecca Woodman , said . “ But as his dementia has progressed , he no longer has a rational understanding of why the government plans to execute him . ”\nPurkey believes his planned execution is part of a conspiracy involving his attorneys , Woodman said . In other filings , they describe delusions that people were spraying poison into his room and that drug dealers implanted a device in his chest meant to kill him .\nWhile various legal issues in Purkey ’ s case have been hashed , rehashed and settled by courts over nearly two decades , “ competency is something that is always in flux , ” according to Dunham , who teaches law school courses on capital punishment .\nIn a landmark 1986 decision , the Supreme Court ruled the Constitution prohibits executing someone who lacks a reasonable understanding of why he ’ s being executed . It involved the case of Alvin Ford , who was convicted of murder but whose mental health deteriorated behind bars to the point , according to his lawyer , he believed he was pope .\n“ I could say I was Napoleon , ” Dunham said . “ But if I say I understand that Napoleon was sentenced to death for a crime and is being executed for it — that could allow the execution to go ahead . ”\nPurkey ’ s mental issues go beyond Alzheimer ’ s , his lawyers have said . They say he was subject to sexual and mental abuse as a child and , at 14 , was diagnosed with schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , major depression and psychosis .\nLast week , three mental health organizations urged U.S. Attorney General William Barr to commute Purkey ’ s sentence to life in prison without possibility of parole . The National Alliance on Mental Illness , Mental Health America and the Treatment Advocacy Center said executing mentally ailing people like Purkey “ constitutes cruel and unusual punishment and does not comport with ‘ evolving standards of decency . ’ ”\nGlenda Lamont , the mother of the slain teenager , told The Kansas City Star last year she planned to attend Purkey ’ s execution .\n“ I don ’ t want to say that I ’ m happy , ” Lamont said . “ At the same time , he is a crazy madman that doesn ’ t deserve , in my opinion , to be breathing anymore . ”\nPresident Donald Trump ’ s campaign touted the Lee execution in an email blast , saying the president “ Ensured Total Justice for the Victims of an Evil Killer ” and demanding his political opponent Joe Biden explain why he now opposes capital punishment .\nThere was an unofficial moratorium on federal executions after the Obama administration ordered a review in 2014 following a botched execution in Oklahoma . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

The noose found hanging in Wallace 's garage stall at Talladega had been there since at least last October , federal authorities said Tuesday , June 23 , in announcing there will be no charges filed in an incident that rocked NASCAR and its only fulltime Black driver . ( AP Photo/John Bazemore , File )\nNASCAR went to Talladega Superspeedway on heightened alert after Bubba Wallace , its only Black driver , took on an active role in a push for racial equality .\nWallace had successfully called for the ban of the Confederate flag and received threats . Fans paraded past the main entrance of the Alabama track displaying the flag , and a plane circled above the speedway pulling a Confederate flag banner that read “ Defund NASCAR . ”\nSo NASCAR moved quickly when one of Wallace ’ s crew members discovered a rope shaped like a noose in their garage stall . The sanctioning body called in federal authorities , who ruled Tuesday the rope had been hanging there since at least last October and was not a hate crime .\nU.S. Attorney Jay Town and FBI Special Agent in Charge Johnnie Sharp Jr. said the investigation determined “ nobody could have known Mr. Wallace would be assigned ” to that same stall . NASCAR said it was the lone garage stall with a pull down rope that resembled a noose .\nNASCAR has defended its reaction and insisted it would call the FBI again . A defiant Wallace said there is no confusion and the rope had been fashioned into a noose .\n“ I wanted to make sure this wasn ’ t just a knot , ” Wallace said on CNN . “ It was a noose . Whether it was tied in 2019 ... it is a noose . ”\nWallace never saw the rope . He said NASCAR President Steve Phelps came to see him Sunday night at the track with “ tears running down his face . ”\n“ The evidence he brought to me was that a hate crime has been committed , ” said Wallace , who instantly began to fear for the safety of his family .\nEven after the FBI concluded that it was not a hate crime , Wallace remained angry at what he perceives as constant tests of his character . He holds no ill-will toward NASCAR .\n“ I stand behind Steve and I stand behind NASCAR , ” he said . “ NASCAR was worried about Talladega . We had that one circled on the radar with everything going on . ”\nNASCAR opened the Talladega gates to 5,000 fans , its highest number so far during the coronavirus pandemic .\nSince finding his voice over the last month , the 26-year-old Mobile , Alabama native has embraced an international role in NASCAR ’ s attempt to push past its rocky racial history . Wallace has worn an “ I Can ’ t Breathe ” shirt , raced with a Black Lives Matter paint scheme in Virginia and successfully lobbied for the Confederate flag ban .\nNASCAR assigned security to Wallace at the track . The first word of the incident came in a sharply worded statement in which NASCAR said it was “ angry and outraged ” over the “ heinous act ” that the series directly linked to racism .\nThe FBI sent 15 agents to Talladega for Monday ’ s rescheduled race at the same time the industry rallied around Wallace . In an unprecedented show of solidarity , every team member on pit road lined up behind him during the national anthem .\nPhelps has taken exactly nine questions about the finding in Wallace ’ s garage and none provided any details of the incident . Because of health protocol restrictions , a limited number of personnel have access to the garage . Only a handful of Wallace ’ s crew members and NASCAR saw the rope .\nRoughly 48 hours after the discovery , federal authorities said video confirmed the rope “ was in that garage as early as October 2019 ” hanging from a garage door . The rope was referred to as a noose , but can be used as a handle when closing the door .\nPhelps continued to call it a noose after authorities said no charges would be filed , and held firm in that NASCAR is investigating why the rope was tied that way . He was pleased it wasn ’ t a hate crime directed at Wallace , but insisted NASCAR would have conducted its investigation the same way even now knowing it was just a coincidence .\n“ We would have done the same investigation . It was important for us to do , ” he said .\n“ The evidence was very clear that the noose that was in the garage was in there previously . The last race we had in October , that noose was present . The evidence we had , it was clear we needed to look into this . ”\nMeanwhile , Wood Brothers Racing team said it cooperated with the investigation and an employee recalled “ seeing a tied handle in the garage pull down rope from last fall , ” when the team had the stall .\nNASCAR saying it had found a noose stunned the stock car series as it takes an active position in a push for inclusion . The series first tried to ban the Confederate flag five years ago but did nothing to enforce the order .\nNASCAR has yet to detail how it will answer Wallace ’ s call to stop the display of the flag . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

The Supreme Court is taking up the first major abortion case of the Trump era Wednesday , an election-year look at a Louisiana dispute that could reveal how willing the more conservative court is to roll back abortion rights . ( AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana )\nWASHINGTON ( AP ) — A seemingly divided Supreme Court struggled Wednesday with its first major abortion case of the Trump era , leaving Chief Justice John Roberts as the likely deciding vote .\nRoberts did not say enough to tip his hand in an hour of spirited arguments at the high court .\nThe court ’ s election-year look at a Louisiana dispute could reveal how willing the more conservative court is to roll back abortion rights . A decision should come by late June .\nThe outcome could have huge consequences at a time when several states have passed laws , being challenged in the courts , that would ban abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected , as early as six weeks .\nThe justices are weighing a Louisiana law requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital . A federal judge found that just one of Louisiana ’ s three abortion clinics would remain open if the law is allowed to take effect . The federal appeals court in New Orleans , though , upheld the law , setting up the Supreme Court case .\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted , as she had before , that “ among medical procedures , first trimester abortion is among the safest , far safer than childbirth. ” The abortion clinic in Shreveport at the heart of the case reported transferring just four patients to a hospital out of roughly 70,000 it has treated over 23 years , Justice Elena Kagan noted .\nJustice Samuel Alito said the clinic had once had its license suspended , in 2010 .\nPerhaps the biggest question is whether the court will overrule a 2016 decision in which it struck down a similar law in Texas . Since then , Donald Trump was elected president and he appointed two justices , Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh , who have shifted the court to the right . Even with those two additions to the court , Roberts almost certainly holds the deciding vote .\nWhen the justices temporarily blocked the Louisiana law from taking effect a year ago , Roberts joined the court ’ s four liberal justices to put it on hold . Kavanaugh and Gorsuch were among the four conservatives who would have allowed the law to take effect .\nThose preliminary votes do not bind the justices when they undertake a thorough review of an issue , but they often signal how a case will come out .\nIn more than 14 years as chief justice , Roberts has generally voted to uphold abortion restrictions , including in the Texas case four years ago .\nIt is for now unclear whether Roberts ’ outlook on the Louisiana case has been affected by his new role as the court ’ s swing justice since Justice Anthony Kennedy ’ s retirement , his concern about the court being perceived as a partisan institution and his respect for a prior decision of the court , even one he disagreed with .\nOne possible outcome is that Roberts and the other conservative justices could find a way to allow Louisiana to enforce the law , without overruling the decision from 2016 in which the court struck down a similar law in Texas . One avenue raised by lawyers for the state and the Trump administration is that the doctors didn ’ t try hard enough to work out arrangements with the hospitals , even though the trial court found that doctors failed to secure admitting privileges at 15 hospitals over an 18-month period .\nThat result would be a defeat for abortion rights advocates who have argued that the laws are virtually indistinguishable . But it would allow Roberts something of a middle ground between taking a big step to limit abortion access and reaffirming the court ’ s abortion rulings .\nRoberts asked the same question , in slightly different form , to each of the three lawyers who argued before the court . The court in the Texas case found there was no benefit to the women the law was ostensibly intended to help and struck it down as an “ undue burden ” on women ’ s right to an abortion in violation of the Constitution .\n“ I understand the idea that the impact might be different in different places , but as far as the benefits of the law , that ’ s going to be the same in each state , isn ’ t it ? ” Roberts asked Louisiana Solicitor General Elizabeth Murrill .\nThe Louisiana and Texas situations are not identical , Murrill told the court . “ The laws are different , the facts are different , the regulatory structures are different , ” Murrill said .\nRoberts ’ inquiry seemed to dovetail with questions from Kavanaugh , whose interest was in discerning whether admitting privileges laws would still impose an “ ” undue burden ” in a state that made it easy for abortion providers to get them .\n“ Could an admitting privileges law of this kind ever have a valid purpose , in your view ? ” Kavanaugh asked lawyer Julie Rikelman , representing the Shreveport clinic .\nRikelman replied : “ No , Your Honor . The medical consensus against these laws is clear . ”\nThe court also has agreed to review whether abortion providers have the right to go into court to represent the interests of women seeking abortions . A ruling in favor of the state ’ s argument that the providers lack the right to sue in these circumstances , known as third-party standing , would be a devastating blow to abortion rights advocates since doctors and clinics , not individual women who want abortions , file most challenges to abortion restrictions .\nBut apart from Alito , the justices did not seem especially interested in resolving the case on the standing issue .\nOutside the court , protesters on both sides filled the sidewalks just as they have for earlier high court cases on abortion .\nInside , Justice Stephen Breyer sought to capture searing debate over the issue . “ I understand there are good arguments on both sides . Indeed , in the country people have very strong feelings and a lot of people morally think it ’ s wrong and a lot of people morally think the opposite is wrong , ” Breyer said , though he left little doubt he would vote in favor of abortion rights . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

The charges involve tax and bank fraud , not possible collusion between Russia and Donald Trump ’ s campaign for president .\nA Manafort conviction would undermine efforts by Trump and some Republican lawmakers to paint Mueller ’ s Russia inquiry as a political witch hunt , while an acquittal would be a setback for the special counsel .\nThe star witness against Manafort was seen as Rick Gates , his former right-hand man , who was indicted along with Manafort but pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with the government .\nThe defense has portrayed Gates as a lying thief who had his hand in the “ cookie jar ” and was only trying to reduce his own sentence , noting Gates will be allowed to argue for probation even though he admitted to embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars and being involved in Manafort ’ s alleged crimes .\nAndres argued that while Manafort did not “ choose a Boy Scout ” as his associate , Gates ’ testimony was corroborated by other evidence , including nearly 400 exhibits , and a series of financial professionals who took the stand for the prosecution .\n“ The star witness in this case is the documents , ” Andres told the jury .\n“ That wasn ’ t a cookie jar , ” he added , referring to the tens of millions of dollars Manafort held overseas . “ It was a huge dumpster of hidden money in foreign bank accounts . ”\nProsecutors say Manafort , 69 , tried to mislead bankers with doctored financial statements in 2015 and 2016 to secure more than $ 20 million in loans and failed to pay taxes on more than $ 15 million that he earned as a political consultant in Ukraine .\nDefense lawyers decided not to call any witnesses in the trial , and Manafort , a veteran Republican political operative , did not testify in his own defense .\nIn the defense ’ s closing argument , Manafort ’ s lawyers argued that issues with his financial situation were known to the bankers before they extended him the loans .\nThey also sought to emphasize the idea that Manafort did not knowingly break the law - a requirement for conviction - and was rather failed by the bookkeepers , accountants and other professionals in whom he trusted his financial affairs .\n“ Sometimes the people we rely on are trustworthy . Sometimes they are not , ” said lawyer Richard Westling .\nThe defense took particular aim at Gates , who admitted in court to an extramarital affair . Gates also said he helped Manafort doctor financial statements , hide foreign income and evade hundreds of thousands of dollars in U.S. income taxes .\nManafort ’ s attorneys have portrayed Gates as living a secret life of infidelity and embezzlement . Defense lawyer Kevin Downing told the jury that Gates had shown himself to be a liar .\n“ He came in here trying to look all clean shaven , ” Downing said . “ He came in here and tried to get one over on you . ”\nManafort made millions of dollars working for pro-Russian Ukrainian politicians before taking an unpaid position with Trump ’ s campaign . He was on the campaign team for five months and led it in mid-2016 when Trump was selected as the Republican presidential nominee .\nProsecutors say Manafort hid money in offshore bank accounts and then used it to pay for over $ 6 million in New York and Virginia real estate , items such as antique rugs and fancy clothes , including a $ 15,000 jacket made of ostrich skin .\nIf found guilty on all 18 charges by the 12-person jury , he could face eight to 10 years in prison , according to sentencing expert Justin Paperny .\nManafort also faces a second trial in September in Washington , where he is accused of failing to disclose lobbying for Ukrainian politicians , among other crimes .\nAfter the defense concluded its closing argument , Andres objected to Downing ’ s suggestions that a civil audit would have been more appropriate for Manafort ’ s tax issues and that Mueller ’ s office had unfairly singled him out .\nJudge T.S . Ellis sided with Andres , and when he later gave instructions to jurors , he told them that the government was not required to do a civil tax audit before bringing criminal charges . He also instructed them to ignore any argument about the Department of Justice ’ s motives in bringing the case .\n“ We don ’ t want the jury deciding this case on that issue , ” Ellis said earlier .\nBefore the jurors left for the day , the judge suggested that they not discuss their deliberations with the media after the verdict , claiming it might have a “ chilling effect . ” \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

The image is also not included in the Anti-Defamation League ’ s database of symbols of hate . ”\nA spokesman for the ADL said its database was not one of historical Nazi symbols but of those “ commonly used by modern extremists and white supremacists in the United States . ”\nHe also said that there have been some antifa who have used the red triangle , but that it was not a particularly common symbol used by the group .\nMark Bray , a historian at Rutgers University and the author of “ Antifa : The Anti-Fascist Handbook , ” said that the red triangle had been reclaimed by some leftist groups in the United Kingdom and Germany after World War Two but that he had never come across any use of it by anti-fascists in the United States .\nA ███ tally counted 88 versions of the ad using the symbol from the three Facebook pages .

    "74": "WASHINGTON ( ███ ) - A federal judge on Friday ordered lawyers for Special Counsel Robert Mueller and President Donald Trump ’ s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort to appear Feb. 4 for a closed hearing on whether Manafort breached his plea deal by lying to investigators .\nJudge Amy Berman Jackson in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia cast doubt on some of the lying allegations against Manafort but said others appeared more firm .\nThe special counsel has accused Manafort , 69 , of breaching his plea deal by lying to federal investigators on at least five different subjects ranging from his contacts with Trump administration officials in 2018 to his interactions with his former business partner in Ukraine Konstantin Kilimnik , who Mueller ’ s office has said has ties to Russian intelligence .\nSome details about Manafort ’ s alleged lies were made public inadvertently by his defense lawyers in a Jan. 8 court filing . Prosecutors said Manafort lied about sharing election polling data with Kilimnik , about his discussions with Kilimnik concerning a Ukrainian peace plan and a meeting the two had in Madrid .\nKilimnik , who has denied ties to Russian intelligence , was indicted by Mueller in June on obstruction of justice charges .\nManafort ’ s attorneys say he had memory lapses but was not trying to lead investigators astray .\nJackson said the court would release a redacted transcript of Manafort ’ s February hearing soon after its conclusion .\nShe said she was a bit torn after reading the court pleadings . Jackson said “ not all of the instances rise to the level of actual false statements within the meaning of the criminal code ” but that in other cases Manafort “ may have lied - pure and simple . ”\nIf Jackson finds Manafort breached his agreement , it is still unclear how it would impact his sentence .\nManafort pleaded guilty in September 2018 in the Washington case to attempted witness tapering and conspiring against the United States , a charge that covers conduct including money laundering and unregistered lobbying . Both counts carry a statutory maximum of 10 years , which is well below the sentencing guidelines .\nTo increase the sentence beyond the 10-year maximum , prosecutors could file fresh charges against Manafort for lying or recharge him with the other remaining counts in the indictment , according to sentencing experts .\nJackson also could consider stacking his sentence on top of whatever he gets in the Eastern District of Virginia , where he is due to be sentenced on Feb. 8 after a jury convicted him on eight counts of bank and tax fraud .\nOn Friday , prosecutor Andrew Weissmann said his office does not currently intend to charge Manafort with other crimes and there is no reason to delay sentencing .\nHe declined to rule out the chance that charges could be filed later against Manafort by Mueller ’ s office or other Justice Department prosecutors .\nManafort , who has in recent months waived most court appearances , showed up to court on Friday wearing a suit and walking with the assistance of a cane .\nHis hearing came on the same day that his former business partner and fellow Trump campaign associate Roger Stone was arrested on charges of obstruction , witness tampering and making false statements related to the release of stolen Democratic Party emails during the 2016 presidential campaign .\nMueller , a former FBI director , is investigating whether Trump ’ s campaign conspired with Moscow and whether the president unlawfully sought to obstruct the probe .

The shutdown began after Trump insisted that $ 5.7 billion for his wall be made a part of any legislation to restore funding for many agencies that expired for unrelated reasons , a demand Democrats oppose .\nAs much as 85 percent of the Justice Department ’ s employees are working , as are nearly 90 percent of the Department of Homeland Security ’ s employees , said department spokesmen .\n“ It really wears on our members , ” said Nathan Catura , the national president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association , which represents some 27,000 federal agents .\n“ You feel like a pawn in this big political windstorm .

Small businesses , who get government relief money are expected to rehire workers , are unsure when the business will reopen and how it will operate . ( AP Photo/Charles Krupa )\nWASHINGTON ( AP ) — Some small businesses that obtained a highly-coveted government loan say they won ’ t be able to use it to bring all their laid-off workers back , even though that is what the program was designed to do .\nThe Paycheck Protection Program promises a business owner loan forgiveness if they retain or rehire all the workers they had in late February . But owners say the equation isn ’ t so simple , in part because of current economic conditions and partly due to the terms of the loans .\nAs a result , the lending may not reduce unemployment as much as the Trump administration and Congress hope .\nThe government ’ s $ 2 trillion relief package included $ 349 billion for the small business loan program , which was besieged with applications and ran out of money Thursday . Congress and the White House reached a deal Tuesday that would provide another $ 310 billion .\nTo get the loans forgiven , companies need to spend 75 % on payroll within eight weeks of receiving the money . The other 25 % can be spent on rent , utilities , and mortgage payments . Otherwise , the loan has generous terms : Only a 1 % interest rate and six months before any principal is due .\nMany of the small companies that were able to obtain a loan are having second thoughts about rehiring all their workers and a few plan to return the money . Others will use what they can on rent and utilities , and will use some to rehire a portion of their laid-off staff . But most are unsure they will be able to reopen eight weeks from now . They see little point in rehiring all their workers , paying them to do little or nothing , and then potentially laying them off again if business remains weak two months from now .\n“ You ’ re turning the business into a pass through for the federal government , ” said Joe Walsh , who owns Clean Green Maine , a cleaning service in Portland , Maine with 35 employees . “ You ’ re doing very little to actually help the business . ”\nIt ’ s unclear how much the small business lending program can hold back the surge in joblessness — a record 22 million people sought unemployment aid in the past month . Most economists forecast the unemployment rate will reach between 15 % and 20 % when the monthly jobs report is released in early May .\nMore money is clearly needed : Roughly 1.6 million small companies were able to obtain loans , the Small Business Administration said , out of at least 6 million that were likely eligible , according to Census data . Bank of America economists estimate that another $ 650 billion would be necessary to meet demand .\nAlso , the generous unemployment aid that was also included in the government ’ s relief package has made it more difficult to rehire . Many workers are making more with unemployment checks , which now include a $ 600 weekly benefit from the federal government .\nWalsh , who received a $ 280,000 loan from the SBA , said that he is reluctant to push his employees to return to work because , under unemployment benefit rules , they could lose their weekly checks if they turn down potential jobs .\n“ That ’ s just putting me as the employer in a really difficult position , ” Walsh said . He pays at least $ 17 an hour , with benefits , but his former employees are getting the equivalent of roughly $ 25 an hour from unemployment .\nRight now , Walsh ’ s business is closed due to lack of demand for cleaning services . He hopes to reopen soon and bring back some workers , retrain them on new sanitizing processes , and earn a bit of revenue . Still , he doubts his business will be anywhere close to what it was anytime soon , which means his workforce won ’ t be either .\n“ There ’ s no way that I ’ m getting to 100 % employment by the end of 8 weeks , ” he said .\nThe National Federation for Independent Business , a small business advocacy group , is pushing the government to make it easier for loans to be forgiven .\nThe group wants the SBA to eliminate the requirement that 75 % be spent on payroll , or at least reduce it to 50 % . It also wants the rehiring window extended beyond eight weeks and is pushing for a “ good faith ” provision that would credit companies for trying to rehire workers who prefer unemployment aid instead .\nThe NFIB also asked that half the next round of funding be reserved for businesses with fewer than 20 employees , to counter complaints that many large , publicly-traded companies obtained loans in the first round . The agreement reached late Tuesday did not make that change but directed some funds to smaller banks .\nAccording to a survey of its members , the NFIB said that just half of those who have applied for loans expect that they will rehire all their workers and get the entire amount forgiven . A quarter expect that at least three-quarters of the loan will be forgiven , while 15 % didn ’ t know .\nThe American Sustainable Business Council and several other small business groups are pushing to have the starting date for rehiring shifted from the date a company received a loan to the date it can legally reopen . Many restaurants , gyms , and movie theaters have been shut down by the state .\nAdam Rammel received a $ 160,000 loan for his restaurant and bar in Bellefontaine , Ohio , near Columbus , though he ’ s uncertain about how many of his 17 laid-off staffers he will be able to rehire and when . Even when Ohio ends its restaurant shutdown , Rammel expects to face restrictions on how many people his place , Brewfontaine , can have on the premises .\n“ We have a small restaurant — we usually pack 90 to 100 in and they ’ re on top of each other . If everyone has to be six feet apart , with 40 or 45 ( customers ) we can ’ t pay the bills , ” Rammel said . He expects to bring his employees back slowly .\nAccounting firm Isdaner & Co. , based near Philadelphia , said in a client note that “ some employers will decide not to sign their loan agreement because their business is essentially closed and choose not to pay their employees for not working . ”\nLaury Hammel owns six gyms in Massachusetts , New Hampshire and Salt Lake City and employs about 480 workers . He doubts he will be able to reopen his Massachusetts locations within eight weeks , so rehiring workers now would simply force him to lay them all off again . And he ’ d be left with no money to pay them when he eventually does re-open .\nHammel is using some of the loan he received to pay for his former workers ’ health care coverage , which can be forgiven . If he doesn ’ t use 75 % on rehiring his employees , he may accept the rest as a loan . His bank doesn ’ t want to carry the loan , however , so he may try and return the money .\n“ The process leaves ( small businesses ) cash-poor at the time when they have to re-open , ” Hammel said . “ Me having the money and paying people to not come to work doesn ’ t help my business one iota . ” \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

''\nLater , US media reported that prosecutors in the Cohen case had granted federal immunity to the chairman of the company that publishes the National Enquirer tabloid , David Pecker .\nIn the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election , Ms McDougal sold her story to the Enquirer , which is owned by a personal friend of Mr Trump .\nShe says the $ 150,000 ( £115,000 ) agreement gave the tabloid exclusive story rights and banned her from talking publicly about the alleged affair .\nThe Enquirer did not publish her kiss-and-tell , and she says she was tricked .\nThe hush money payments were not reported to the Federal Election Commission during the campaign .\nThe question is whether the payments were made to protect Mr Trump 's personal reputation or to protect his image as a presidential candidate .\nUnder US election rules , any payments made with the aim of influencing a vote must be reported .\nIf Mr Trump were to be prosecuted over the money - not through the normal courts , because he is the sitting president , but conceivably in Congress , through an impeachment process - investigators would have to prove that he had indeed given the money to Cohen for electoral reasons .\nIn his first public comments , back in April , about his alleged affair with Stormy Daniels , Mr Trump denied knowing about the $ 130,000 ( £100,000 ) payment made to the actress via Cohen .\nMs Daniels , whose real name is Stephanie Clifford , alleges that she and Mr Trump had sex in a hotel room in 2006 .\nAsked by a reporter in the press cabin of Air Force One if he had any knowledge about where Cohen had got the money to pay Ms Daniels , the president responded at the time : `` I do n't know . ''\nThe following month , Mr Trump officially disclosed a payment to Cohen of between $ 100,001 and $ 250,000 for expenses incurred in 2016 .\nA president who often seems defiant and even dismissive is for the moment on the defensive .\nIt is a sign of the pressure on Donald Trump that he is not only having to answer questions about the possibility of impeachment , but having to make economic arguments against it .\nControl of Congress has now become a crucial issue because the House of Representatives would need to vote to impeach a sitting president .\nFor the moment he is protected by the dominance of the Republicans in Congress , but the party looks nervous and unsettled after a week that has truly rocked Washington .\nTwo former members of the president 's inner circle being convicted of serious crimes would be scandal enough , but to have one of them point a finger of blame directly at Mr Trump makes this a truly trying time .\nSome of his answers in the Fox and Friends interview were less than convincing , particularly as he tried to distance himself from his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen and the payments he arranged .\nHowever , past experience has shown that it takes a lot to shake the belief and devotion of Mr Trump 's supporters . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

Intelligence officials say Russia is interfering with the 2020 election to try to help Trump get reelected , The New York Times reported Thursday , Feb. 20 , 2020 . ( AP Photo/Susan Walsh , File )\nWASHINGTON ( AP ) — Intelligence officials have warned lawmakers that Russia is interfering in the 2020 election campaign to help President Donald Trump get reelected , according to three officials familiar with the closed-door briefing .\nTrump pushed back Friday accusing Democrats of launching a disinformation campaign .\n“ Another misinformation campaign is being launched by Democrats in Congress saying that Russia prefers me to any of the Do Nothing Democrat candidates who still have been unable to , after two weeks , count their votes in Iowa . Hoax number 7 ! ” Trump tweeted .\nThe officials , who asked for anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence , said Thursday that the briefing last week focused on Russia ’ s efforts to influence the 2020 election and sow discord in the American electorate . The intelligence warning was first reported by The New York Times and The Washington Post .\nA senior administration official told The ███ that the news infuriated Trump , who complained that Democrats would use the information against him . Over the course of his presidency , Trump has dismissed the intelligence community ’ s assessment of Russia ’ s 2016 election interference as a conspiracy to undermine his victory . The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private meeting .\nA day after the Feb. 13 briefing to the House committee , Trump berated the then-director of national intelligence , Joseph Maguire , and he announced this week that Maguire would be replaced by Richard Grenell , a Trump loyalist .\nMoscow denied any meddling . Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that the allegations are “ paranoid reports that , unfortunately , there will be more and more of as we get closer to the elections ( in the U.S. ) . Of course , they have nothing to do with the truth . ”\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi tweeted that , “ American voters should decide American elections — not Vladimir Putin. ” She added that all members of Congress “ should condemn the President ’ s reported efforts to dismiss threats to the integrity of our democracy & to politicize our intel community . ”\nRep. Adam Schiff , D-Calif. , the chairman of the House intelligence committee , tweeted : “ We count on the intelligence community to inform Congress of any threat of foreign interference in our elections . If reports are true and the President is interfering with that , he is again jeopardizing our efforts to stop foreign meddling . Exactly as we warned he would do . ”\nU.S. intelligence agencies say Russia interfered in the 2016 election through social media campaigns and stealing and distributing emails from Democratic accounts . They say Russia was trying to boost Trump ’ s campaign and add chaos to the American political process . Special counsel Robert Mueller concluded that Russian interference was “ sweeping and systematic , ” but he did not find a criminal conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign .\nRepublican lawmakers who were in last week ’ s briefing by the DNI ’ s chief election official , Shelby Pierson , pushed back by noting that Trump has been tough on Russia , one of the officials said .\nWhile Trump has imposed severe economic sanctions on Russia , he also has spoken warmly of Russian leader Vladimir Putin and withdrawn troops from areas , like Syria , where Moscow could fill the vacuum . He delayed military aid last year to Ukraine , a Russian adversary — a decision that was at the core of his impeachment proceedings .\nThe Times said Trump was angry that the House briefing was made before Schiff , the panel ’ s chairman , who led the impeachment proceedings .\nTrump on Thursday formally appointed Grenell , the U.S. ambassador to Germany , to replace Maguire as the new acting director of national intelligence . Maguire was required to step down soon under federal law governing acting appointments . The Times cited two administration officials as saying the timing , after the intelligence briefing , was coincidental .\nGrenell ’ s background is primarily in politics and media affairs . He lacks the extensive national security and military experience of Maguire , as well as previous holders of the position overseeing the nation ’ s 17 intelligence agencies .\nHis appointment does little to heal the president ’ s fraught relations with the intelligence community , which Trump has derided as part of a “ deep state ” of entrenched bureaucrats that seek to undermine his agenda . The administration has most notably feuded with the intelligence community over the Russian interference and the events surrounding Trump ’ s impeachment .\nPierson told NPR in an interview that aired last month that the Russians “ are already engaging in influence operations relative to candidates going into 2020 . But we do not have evidence at this time that our adversaries are directly looking at interfering with vote counts or the vote tallies . ”\nPierson , appointed in July 2019 by then-Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats , works with intelligence agencies like the CIA , the FBI , the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security to identify anyone seeking to interfere with U.S. elections .\nPierson told NPR that the U.S. doesn ’ t know exactly what the Russians are planning , but she said it ’ s not just a Russia problem .\n“ We ’ re still also concerned about China , Iran , non-state actors , hacktivists and frankly — certainly for DHS and FBI - even Americans that might be looking to undermine confidence in the elections . ”\nAt an open hearing this month , FBI Director Christopher Wray told the House Judiciary Committee that Russia was engaged in “ information warfare ” heading into the November election , but that law enforcement had not seen efforts to target America ’ s infrastructure . He said Russia is relying on a covert social media campaign to divide the American public . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

It cost billions of dollars to build . We 're not leaving unless they pay us back for it , '' he told reporters .\nTensions are high after the US assassinated Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad last week .\nSoleimani , 62 , spearheaded Iranian military operations in the Middle East , and was regarded as a terrorist by the US .\nThe general 's remains have now returned to his home country , where mourners packed the streets of Tehran early on Monday .\nThe new head of Iran 's Quds force - which Soleimani led - has vowed to expel the US from the Middle East .\n`` We promise to continue martyr Soleimani 's path with the same force ... and the only compensation for us would be to remove America from the region , '' state radio quoted Esmail Qaani as saying .\nThe strike that killed Soleimani also claimed the life of Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis , a top Iraqi military figure who commanded the Iranian-backed Kataib Hezbollah group .\nSpeaking from the presidential plane , Mr Trump said that if Iraq asked US forces to depart on an unfriendly basis , `` we will charge them sanctions like they 've never seen before , ever . It 'll make Iranian sanctions look somewhat tame . ''\nSome 5,000 US soldiers are in Iraq as part of the international coalition against the Islamic State ( IS ) group .\nOn Sunday , the coalition paused its operations against IS in Iraq , and Iraqi MPs passed a non-binding resolution calling for foreign troops to leave .\nThe resolution was pushed through by the parliament 's Shia Muslim bloc - which is close to Iran .\nIran has announced it will no longer abide by restrictions imposed by the 2015 nuclear deal , under which it agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors in return for the lifting of economic sanctions .\nUS President Donald Trump abandoned the deal in 2018 , saying he wanted to force Iran to negotiate a new deal that would place indefinite curbs on its nuclear programme and also halt its development of ballistic missiles .\nIran refused and had since been gradually rolling back its commitments under the deal .\nIn a statement , it said it would no longer observe limitations on its capacity for enrichment , the level of enrichment , the stock of enriched material , or research and development .\nThe leaders of Germany , France and the UK - which were all signatories to the 2015 deal , alongside China and Russia - responded with a joint statement urging Iran to refrain from `` further violent action or proliferation '' .\n`` It is crucial now to de-escalate . We call on all the players involved to show utmost restraint and responsibility , '' they said .\nMr Trump has vowed to strike back at Iran in the event of retaliation for Soleimani 's death , `` perhaps in a disproportionate manner '' .\nHe also repeated a controversial threat to target Iranian cultural sites on Sunday , despite criticism from within the US and overseas .\n`` They 're allowed to kill our people . They 're allowed to torture and maim our people . They 're allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people . And we 're not allowed to touch their cultural site ? It does n't work that way , '' the president said .\nIn a series of tweets on Saturday , Mr Trump said the US had identified 52 Iranian sites , some `` at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture '' , and warned they would be `` HIT VERY FAST AND HARD '' if Tehran struck at the US .\nUS Senator Elizabeth Warren , a senior member of the Democratic Party , responded by tweeting : `` You are threatening to commit war crimes . ''\nIran 's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif drew parallels with IS destruction of the Middle East 's cultural riches .\n`` A reminder to those hallucinating about emulating ISIS war crimes by targeting our cultural heritage , '' he tweeted . `` Through MILLENNIA of history , barbarians have come and ravaged our cities , razed our monuments and burnt our libraries . Where are they now ? We 're still here , & standing tall . ''\nTargeting cultural sites is banned under the Geneva and Hague Conventions - and violating them would constitute a war crime in the US .\nIran is home to two dozen Unesco World Heritage sites . These are landmarks the UN 's cultural organisation believes need preserving for their cultural , historic or scientific significance . They include :\nPersepolis , the capital of the ancient Persian Achaemenid empire and whose earliest remains date back to Sixth Century BC\nNaqsh-e Jahan Square in the city of Isfahan , which was built in the early 17th Century and is is one of the largest city squares in the world\nGolestan Palace in Tehran , the residence and seat of power for the Qajar dynasty which ruled Iran from 1785 to 1925\nThere are also a number of sites which - while not listed by Unesco - still retain huge cultural importance . For example , the Azadi ( Freedom ) Tower in Tehran has been the gathering point for celebrations , military parades and mass demonstrations for almost 50 years .\nElsewhere in the city , the Mausoleum of Ruhollah Khomeini is dedicated to the Islamic Republic 's founder and also houses the tombs of some of the country 's leading political figures .\nThe country has always insisted that its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful - but suspicions that it was being used to develop a bomb covertly prompted the UN Security Council , US and EU to impose crippling sanctions in 2010 .\nThe 2015 deal was designed to constrain the programme in a verifiable way in return for sanctions relief .\nIt restricted Iran 's enrichment of uranium , which is used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons , to 3.67 % . Iran was also required to redesign a heavy-water reactor being built , whose spent fuel would contain plutonium suitable for a bomb , and allow international inspections .\nBefore July 2015 , Iran had a large stockpile of enriched uranium and almost 20,000 centrifuges , enough to create eight to 10 bombs , according to the White House at the time .\nUS experts estimated back then that if Iran had decided to rush to make a bomb , it would take two to three months until it had enough 90 % -enriched uranium to build a nuclear weapon - the so-called `` breakout time '' .\nIran 's current `` breakout time '' , should it attempt to build a nuclear bomb , is estimated to be around a year , but this could be reduced to half a year or even a matter of months if enrichment levels are increased to 20 % , for example . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

Russia called the move a ploy to exit a pact that the United States wanted to leave anyway in order to develop new missiles .\nPresident Donald Trump told reporters he would like to seal a new arms deal with Russia reducing all nuclear forces , and possibly with China as well .\n“ If we could get a pact where they reduce and we reduce nuclear , that would be a good thing for the world . I do believe that will happen , ” Trump said .\nThe Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty ( INF ) was negotiated by then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev . It banned land-based missiles with a range of between 310 and 3,400 miles ( 500-5,500 km ) , reducing the ability of both countries to launch a nuclear strike on short notice .\nThe dispute is aggravating the worst U.S.-Russia friction since the Cold War ended in 1991 . Some experts believe the treaty ’ s collapse could undermine other arms control agreements and speed an erosion of the global system designed to block the spread of nuclear arms .\n“ The United States will not remain party to a treaty that is deliberately violated by Russia , ” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement .\n“ Russia ’ s non-compliance under the treaty jeopardizes U.S. supreme interests as Russia ’ s development and fielding of a treaty-violating missile system represents a direct threat to the United States and our allies and partners , ” Pompeo said .\nSenior Trump administration officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said Russia had deployed “ multiple battalions ” of a cruise missile throughout Russia in violation of the pact , including in western Russia , “ with the ability to strike critical European targets . ”\nRussia denies the allegation , saying the missile ’ s range puts it outside the treaty . It rejected a U.S. demand to destroy the new missile , the Novator 9M729 , known as the SSC-8 by the NATO Western military alliance .\nMoscow has told Washington the U.S. decision to quit the pact undermines global security and removes a key pillar of international arms control .\nChina ’ s new ambassador to the United Nations , Zhang Jun , said China regrets that the United States is withdrawing from the treaty and expressed doubt about joining the United States and Russia in a nuclear deal .\n“ The United States is saying China should be a party in this disarmament agreement , but I think everybody knows that China is not at the same level with the United States and the Russian Federation , ” he said .\nRussia said on Friday it had asked the United States for a moratorium on the deployment of land-based short and intermediate-range nuclear missiles .\n“ A serious mistake has been made in Washington , ” Russia ’ s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement .\n“ We have already introduced a unilateral moratorium and won ’ t deploy land-based short or medium-range missiles , if we get them , in regions where such U.S. missiles are not deployed , ” it said .\nPresident Vladimir Putin has said Russia does not want an arms race and he has promised he would not deploy Russian missiles unless the United States does so first .\nHowever , should Washington take such a step , he has said he would be forced to deploy Russian hypersonic nuclear missiles on ships or submarines near U.S. territorial waters .\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg dismissed Russia ’ s moratorium request on Friday , saying it was “ not a credible offer ” as he said Moscow had already deployed illegal missiles .\n“ There are no new U.S. missiles , no new NATO missiles in Europe , but there are more and more new Russian missiles , ” he said .\nNATO said it had agreed a defensive package of measures to deter Russia . That response would be measured and would only involve conventional weapons , it said .\nNATO ’ s Stoltenberg said there would be “ no rash moves ” by the alliance which he said “ would not mirror what Russia does . ”\nNATO members Britain and Poland blamed Moscow for the treaty ’ s demise .\n“ Their contempt for the rules-based international system threatens European security , ” British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said on Twitter .\nEuropean officials had voiced concern that if the treaty collapses , Europe could again become an arena for a nuclear-armed , intermediate-range missile buildup by the United States and Russia .\nU.S. officials said the United States was months away from the first flight tests of an American intermediate-range missile that would serve as a counter to the Russians . Any deployment would be years away , they said .\n“ We are just at the stage of looking at how we might further the development of conventional options , ” one official said . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

( AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez )\nJEFFERSON CITY , Mo . ( AP ) — In Ohio , more than 48,000 people applied for jobless benefits during the first two days of this week . The tally during the same period the prior week : just 1,825 .\nIn neighboring Pennsylvania , about 70,000 people sought unemployment aid in a single day — six times the total for the entire previous week .\nJobless claims are surging across the U.S. after government officials ordered millions of workers , students and shoppers to stay at home as a precaution against spreading the virus that causes the COVID-19 disease .\n“ We ’ ve been getting flooded with calls , ” said John Dodds , director of the nonprofit Philadelphia Unemployment Project . “ It ’ s going to be a big mess , a double mess : illness and unemployment . ”\nThe growing number of people filing for unemployment checks raises fresh questions about whether states have stockpiled enough money since the last recession to tide over idled workers until the crisis ends . Some fear the demand for help could outpace the states ’ ability to pay claims .\n“ Our unemployment insurance fund is getting hit pretty hard right now , ” said Gov . Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island , where coronavirus-related jobless claims accelerated from zero to nearly 18,000 in barely one week .\nRaimondo , a Democrat , said the state needs to start replenishing its fund and appealed for help from the federal government .\nPresident Donald Trump ’ s administration is proposing an economic stimulus package that could approach $ 1 trillion and include sending checks to Americans within a matter of weeks to help them pay for groceries , bills , mortgages and rent . The Senate gave final approval Wednesday to a separate bill that would inject $ 1 billion into state unemployment insurance programs .\nThe federal aid could rival or exceed that of the Great Recession in 2008 , when a financial industry crisis led to widespread layoffs . Economic analysts warn the country is likely entering — or already in — its first recession since then .\nValerie Costa , a 41-year-old mother of two , quickly applied for unemployment benefits after the Rhode Island casino where she worked as a bartender and cocktail server closed because of virus precautions . For now , her husband is still working .\n“ We ’ re limiting our spending . But we also really don ’ t know what to expect , ” she said . “ Most of us live through our tips , and if no tips are coming in , that makes things tough . ”\nThe last recession led to the insolvency of unemployment trust funds in 35 states that collectively racked up more than $ 40 billion of debt to keep paying unemployed workers . In many states , those debts were repaid through higher taxes on employers .\nTo shore up their trust funds , some states also cut the amount and duration of benefits for those who became unemployed in the future .\n“ States aren ’ t really recession-ready , because it ’ s so hard for people to get benefits , stay in the program , and the benefits are insufficient , ” said Michele Evermore , a senior policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project , a New York-based group that advocates for low-wage workers and the unemployed .\nJobless claims and unemployment also are rising around the globe . The U.N. ’ s International Labor Organization estimates that fallout from the coronavirus outbreak could lead to nearly 25 million job losses worldwide and drain up to $ 3.4 trillion worth of income by the end of this year .\nIn the U.S. , state unemployment trust funds generally are in better financial shape than they were before the last recession . Yet 21 states began the year with less than the amount recommended to remain solvent in an average recession , according to a U.S. Department of Labor report . At the bottom of the solvency list are many of the most populous states — California , Texas , New York , Illinois , Ohio and Massachusetts .\nOhio Gov . Mike DeWine , a Republican , was among the first to shut down schools , sporting events and certain businesses because of the coronavirus . Unemployment claims have since skyrocketed .\nDeWine ’ s administration acknowledged that state lawmakers likely will have to intervene to shore up the state ’ s shaky unemployment trust fund .\n“ The workers out there should not be worried . It will be funded for their needs , ” said Ohio Lt. Gov . Jon Husted , also a Republican .\nPennsylvania in January finally made the last payment on billions of dollars of bonds issued in 2012 to cover the unemployment fund debt from the last recession . But its fund remains in danger of insolvency , according to the U.S. Labor Department report .\nIn Tennessee , new unemployment claims tripled over the past week . Michigan ’ s unemployment agency said Wednesday that it has received over five times as many unemployment applications as normal . And Minnesota said it has been getting more than 2,000 unemployment applications per hour , compared with the usual 40 or 50 .\nThe Department of Employment and Economic Development has been taking more than 2,000 applications per hour , compared with the usual 40 or 50 , Commissioner Steve Grove said\nWarnings to stay away from public gathering spots also have made it more complicated to apply for benefits , with some state unemployment offices closed to the public . Instead , states have shifted more applicants from offices to websites and phone calls , but even those systems are being taxed .\nNew Jersey Gov . Phil Murphy said the number of unemployment insurance requests was so high at the start of this week that it crashed the state labor department ’ s website .\nNew York ’ s labor department said it ’ s experiencing “ an unprecedented increase ” in calls and online visits for unemployment benefits . During the first half of Tuesday , it had 110,000 website visits and 21,000 phone calls . That ’ s 2 1/2 times the web traffic and 10 times the phone calls of the entire previous Tuesday . At times , the surge was too much for the agency to handle .\nGovernors and lawmakers in many states took action this week to make unemployment benefits easier and quicker to get . Some also waived rules that disregard the first week of unemployment or extended the total number of weeks people can be eligible .\nIn North Carolina , which offers less in jobless benefits than most states , displaced workers won ’ t have to be actively looking for a new job , as is required for traditional benefits , and employers who must lay off workers won ’ t be financially responsible for the benefits their workers receive .\nKansas lawmakers worked quickly Tuesday to pass legislation that eliminates a one-week wait to begin receiving benefits and expands their duration from 16 to 26 weeks . But House Commerce Committee Chairman Rep. Sean Tarwater , a Republican , expressed concern that the economic problems caused by the virus pandemic could deplete the state ’ s unemployment fund in less than a year , even though it ’ s ranked in the top quarter nationally .\n“ What we are seeing is something totally unique here , where the switch has flipped from historically low claims numbers to a dramatic escalation that ’ s going to affect multiple segments of the economy , ” said Kansas Deputy Labor Department Secretary Brett Flachsbarth . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

( FBI via AP )\nWASHINGTON ( AP ) — The gunman who killed three U.S. sailors at a military base in Florida last year communicated with al-Qaida operatives about planning and tactics in the months leading up to the attack , U.S. officials said Monday , as they lashed out at Apple for failing to help them open the shooter ’ s phones so they could access key evidence .\nLaw enforcement officials discovered contacts between Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani and operatives of al-Qaida after FBI technicians succeeded in breaking into two cellphones that had previously been locked and that the shooter , a Saudi Air Force officer , had tried to destroy before he was killed by a sheriff ’ s deputy .\n“ We now have a clearer understanding of Alshamrani ’ s associations and activities in the years , months and days leading up to his attack , ” Attorney General William Barr said at a news conference in which he chastised Apple for not helping open the phones .\nThe new details , including that Alshamrani had been radicalized abroad before he arrived in the U.S. , raise fresh questions about the vetting of foreign military members and trainees who spend time at American bases . The announcement also comes amid tension with the U.S. over instability in the oil market during the coronavirus pandemic and as the Trump administration faces criticism that it has not done enough to hold the kingdom , which has been trying to improve its international image , accountable for human rights violations .\nThe criticism directed at Apple could also escalate divisions between the U.S. government and the technology company , which rejected the characterization that it has been unhelpful . The company said Monday that it does not store customers ’ passcodes , does not have the capacity to unlock passcode-protected devices and that weakening encryption could create vulnerabilities that undermine national secuity and data privacy .\nAlshamrani was killed by a sheriff ’ s deputy during the Dec. 6 rampage at a classroom building at Naval Air Station Pensacola . He had been undergoing flight training at Pensacola as part of instruction offered at American military bases to foreign nationals . Besides the three sailors who died , eight other people were injured .\nOnce unlocked , U.S. officials said , the phones revealed contact between Alshamrani and “ dangerous ” operatives from al-Qaida in the Arabian Pensinsula , or AQAP , that continued until shortly before the shooting . They also revealed that he had been radicalized since at least 2015 , before he arrived in the U.S. , and had meticulously planned the attack .\nAlshamrani created minicam videos as he cased a military school building and saved a will on his phone that purported to explain himself — the same document AQAP released after the shooting when it claimed responsibility for it , said FBI Director Chris Wray , who called the attack “ the brutal culmination of years of planning and preparation . ”\n“ He wasn ’ t just coordinating with them about planning and tactics , ” Wray said . “ He was helping the organization make the most it could out of his murders . ”\nAsked whether al-Qaida had directed or inspired the attacks , Wray said it was “ certainly more than just inspired . ”\nThe phones have already yielded valuable intelligence , officials said , citing a recent counterterrorism operation in Yemen that targeted an AQAP associate Alshamrani had been in touch with .\nThe Justice Department had asked Apple to help extract data from two iPhones that belonged to the gunman , including one that authorities say Alshamrani damaged with a bullet after being confronted by law enforcement .\nBut Wray said Apple provided “ effectively no help , ” delaying by months the FBI ’ s ability to access the devices and hampering the investigation since agents did not have a full picture of what to look for or ask about . He did not say what method was used to open the phones , but said it was a targeted fix and not a broad solution to the problem .\nBarr used Monday ’ s news conference to forcefully call on Apple to do more to cooperate with law enforcement .\n“ In cases like this , where the user is a terrorist , or in other cases , where the user is a violent criminal , a human trafficker , a child predator , Apple ’ s decision has dangerous consequences for public safety and the national security and is , in my judgment , unacceptable , ” Barr said .\nIn a statement Monday , Apple said it had provided the FBI with “ every piece of information available to us , including iCloud backups , account information and transactional data for multiple accounts. ” It rejected the idea of making its products more accessible for law enforcement ’ s benefit .\n“ It is because we take our responsibility to national security so seriously that we do not believe in the creation of a backdoor — one which will make every device vulnerable to bad actors who threaten our national security and the data security of our customers , ” the statement said . “ There is no such thing as a backdoor just for the good guys , and the American people do not have to choose between weakening encryption and effective investigations .\nLaw enforcement officials had previously left no doubt that Alshamrani was motivated by jihadist ideology , saying he visited a New York City memorial to the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend and posted anti-American and anti-Israeli messages on social media just hours before the shooting .\nSeparately , AQAP , al-Qaida ’ s branch in Yemen , released a video claiming the attack . AQAP has long been considered the global network ’ s most dangerous branch .\nIn January , U.S. officials announced that they were sending home 21 Saudi military students after an investigation revealed that they had had jihadist or anti-American sentiments on social media pages or had “ contact with child pornography . ”\nOperational training for Saudi students at multiple U.S bases was suspended soon after the shooting , but the Pentagon has since given the Navy and other military services conditional approval to resume the instruction .\nBarr said Monday that the Saudis have been cooperative and have worked with the U.S. to buttress vetting .\nIn a statement , the Saudi Embassy in the U.S. lauded the developments in the investigation of the shooting and reiterated the Saudi government ’ s support of relations with the U.S. and joint efforts against extremism .\n“ We will never let the terrorists win , or allow their acts of hatred to divide us , ” the embassy said . “ The U.S.-Saudi partnership is one of the primary pillars of the global effort to dismantle and defeat terrorist networks such as AQAP . And our two countries will maintain our unbreakable commitment to combat the forces of evil , wherever they exist . ” \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

    "87": "NEW YORK ( ███ ) - President Donald Trump ’ s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison on Wednesday for crimes including orchestrating hush payments to women in violation of campaign laws before the 2016 election , and he promised to keep cooperating with the U.S. government against his former boss .\nThe sentence , which capped a stunning about-face by a lawyer who once vowed to “ take a bullet ” for Trump , was handed down by a judge in New York on the same day as news that the publisher of the National Enquirer tabloid had struck a deal with prosecutors to avoid charges over its role in one of two hush payments involving Trump .\nThe publisher admitted the payment was aimed at influencing the 2016 election , contradicting Trump ’ s statements .\nThe twin developments highlighted the growing political and legal risks for Trump from a months-long investigation into the payments by federal prosecutors . Some legal experts said Trump could be charged after leaving office . Justice Department policy is not to indict a sitting president .\n“ These prosecutors have charged or reached agreement with everyone involved in this process save one notable exception , ” said Jonathan Turley , a law professor at George Washington University . “ It seems likely that this effort is directed at building a larger case against Donald Trump . ”\nCohen had said in a guilty plea in August that he was directed by Trump to arrange a payment to Playboy model Karen McDougal , and personally pay adult-film star Stormy Daniels . Prosecutors in New York confirmed last week in a court filing that they believed the president ordered the payments to protect his campaign .\nTrump has denied the affairs and argues the payments to the two women were not campaign contributions . “ If it were , it ’ s only civil , and even if it ’ s only civil , there was no violation based on what we did , ” Trump said in an interview on Tuesday .\n“ From the president ’ s point of view , it was to protect his family , ” Trump ’ s lawyer , Rudy Giuliani , told ███ .\nIn the Manhattan courtroom , Cohen told U.S. District Judge William Pauley that “ blind loyalty ” led him to cover up for Trump . Cohen said he was ready to provide “ as much information as I truthfully possess ” on the president .\n“ I am committed to proving my integrity and ensuring that history will not remember me as the villain of his story , ” Cohen said , choking up at times while giving his statement . “ I am truly sorry and I promise I will be better . ”\nPauley sentenced Cohen to three years for the payments , and unrelated crimes of tax evasion and misleading banks . He gave Cohen two months for lying to Congress about a proposed Trump Tower project in Russia . The judge said the two terms would run simultaneously and he set March 6 for Cohen ’ s surrender .\nWhile the sentence was a modest reduction from the four to five years recommended under federal guidelines , Pauley described Cohen ’ s crimes as a “ smorgasbord of fraudulent conduct ” marked by deception and “ motivated by personal greed. ” He ordered Cohen to forfeit $ 500,000 and pay restitution of nearly $ 1.4 million .\nCohen , 52 , walked into court with his wife , son and daughter amid a crowd of photographers and reporters . His 23-year-old daughter , Samantha , and 19-year-old son , Jake , both wept silently in the courtroom , the son wiping his eyes with his jacket sleeve .\nCohen ’ s father , Maurice , a Holocaust survivor who helped convince his son to cooperate with prosecutors against Trump , showed little emotion during the hearing but later told reporters : “ My heart is ripped . ”\nMichael Cohen , U.S. President Donald Trump 's former attorney , exits the United States Court house after his sentencing , in the Manhattan borough of New York City , New York , U.S. , December 12 , 2018 . ███/Jeenah Moon\nPauley sentenced Cohen for two cases - one involving the financial crimes prosecuted by attorneys in the Southern District of New York and the other for lying to Congress brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller . The Special Counsel is investigating Russia ’ s role in the 2016 election and possible coordination between Trump ’ s campaign and Moscow . Russia denies U.S. allegations of election interference and Trump denies collusion .\nProsecutors have said Cohen , just before the November 2016 election , paid Daniels $ 130,000 and helped arrange the $ 150,000 payment to McDougal so the women would keep quiet . Federal law requires that the contribution of “ anything of value ” to a campaign must be disclosed , and an individual donation can not exceed $ 2,700 .\n“ It was my own weakness and a blind loyalty to this man that led me to choose a path of darkness over light , ” Cohen told the judge during the sentencing hearing , referring to Trump .\n“ I felt it was my duty to cover up his own dirty deeds , ” Cohen added .\nThe Mueller investigation represents a threat to Trump ’ s presidency . Mueller , who also is examining whether the president has unlawfully sought to obstruct the probe , has secured guilty pleas from several former Trump aides including his former campaign chairman and national security adviser , and has indicted several Russia individuals and entities .\nOne of Mueller ’ s prosecutors praised Cohen ’ s cooperation , arguing it should be a mitigating factor in his defense .\n“ He has provided valuable information , investigative information , to us , ” attorney Jeannie Rhee told the judge .\nCohen ’ s lawyer likened the political storm that engulfed his client to Watergate , the 1970 ’ s scandal in which the testimony of White House counsel John Dean helped bring down the Nixon presidency , as a way of emphasizing the pressures he faced .\n“ He came forward to offer evidence against the most powerful person in the country , ” Guy Petrillo told the court in a bid for leniency .\nLanny Davis , a lawyer who is advising Cohen on his media strategy , said his client wanted to testify in front of Congress after Mueller completes his investigation and issues a report , which is expected in the coming months .\n“ I look forward to assisting Michael to state publicly all he knows about Mr. Trump - and that includes any appropriate congressional committee interested in the search for truth and the difference between facts and lies , ” Davis said in a statement .\nCohen was part of Trump ’ s inner circle who in the past called himself the president ’ s “ fixer. ” After Cohen pleaded guilty to the Mueller charges on Nov. 29 , Trump called his former lawyer a liar , “ a weak person and not a very smart person . ”\nMichael Avenatti , Daniels ’ lawyer , attended the sentencing and told reporters outside the courthouse , “ Michael Cohen is neither a hero nor a patriot . He lied for months about his conduct . ... Michael Cohen was sentenced today , President Trump is next . ”\nTrump has accused Mueller ’ s team of pressuring his former aides to lie about him , his campaign and his business dealings . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

In a series of sweeping steps , the U.S. Federal Reserve will lend to small and large businesses and local governments as well as extend its bond buying programs . The announcement Monday , March 23 is part of the Fed 's ongoing efforts to support the flow of credit through an economy ravaged by the viral outbreak . ( AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin , File )\nWASHINGTON ( AP ) — The Federal Reserve is unleashing its boldest effort yet to protect the U.S. economy from the coronavirus by helping companies and governments pay their bills and survive a devastating crisis .\nWith lending in Treasury and mortgage markets threatening to shut down , the Fed announced an aggressive set of programs Monday to try to smooth out those markets . To do so , it committed to buy as much government-backed debt as it deems necessary . And for the first time ever , the Fed said it plans to buy corporate debt , too .\nIts intervention is intended to ensure that households , companies , banks and governments can get the loans they need at a time when their own revenue is fast drying up as the economy stalls .\nThe Fed ’ s all-out effort to support the flow of credit through an economy ravaged by the viral outbreak has now gone beyond even the extraordinary drive it made to rescue the economy from the 2008 financial crisis .\n“ The coronavirus pandemic is causing tremendous hardship across the United States and around the world , ” the Fed said in a statement . “ Aggressive efforts must be taken across the public and private sectors to limit the losses to jobs and incomes and to promote a swift recovery once the disruptions abate . ”\nThe announcement initially lifted stocks in early trading . But rancorous talks in Congress over a $ 2 trillion rescue package — and uncertainty over when any agreement might be reached — depressed shares about 2.5 % in volatile midday trading . The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond fell , a sign that more investors are willing to purchase the securities .\nWith its new programs , the Fed , led by Chair Jerome Powell , is trying to both stabilize the economy and allay panic in financial markets . As the need for cash has escalated among many corporations and city and state governments , large businesses have been drawing as much as they can on their existing borrowing relationships with banks .\nThe intensifying need for money means that banks and other investors are seeking to rapidly unload Treasuries , short-term corporate debt , municipal bonds and other securities . The Fed ’ s move to intervene as a buyer of last resort is intended to supply that needed cash .\nPresident Donald Trump , a frequent Fed critic , had rare praise for Powell on Monday .\n“ I really think he ’ s caught up and he ’ s done the right thing , ” Trump said during a White House press conference . He said he called Powell on Monday and said , “ Jerome , good job. ” Less than two weeks ago , Trump was noting that he had the power to fire or demote the Fed chief .\nThe central bank ’ s actions , meanwhile , increase pressure on Congress to approve an agreement that would include funds to backstop the Fed ’ s lending . Many economists say that whatever financial support Congress eventually provides will likely be even more important than the Fed ’ s intervention . And they warn that such fiscal help needs to come soon .\nThe Fed ’ s intervention is not a substitute for fiscal stimulus , ” said Joseph Gagnon , a former Fed economist who is now senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics . “ Let ’ s hope Congress passes something quickly . ”\nJoe Brusuelas , chief economist at RSM , a tax and advisory firm , said that if Congress can pass the legislation and have it signed into law by Tuesday , banks could start making loans to small and medium-sized businesses , with the Fed ’ s support , by Friday .\nIn its announcement Monday , the Fed said it will establish three new lending facilities that will provide up to $ 300 billion by purchasing corporate bonds , a wider range of municipal bonds and securities tied to such debt as auto and real estate loans . It will also buy an unlimited amount of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities to try to hold down borrowing rates and ensure those markets function smoothly .\nThe central bank ’ s go-for-broke approach is an acknowledgment that its previous plans to keep credit flowing smoothly , which included dollar limits , wouldn ’ t be enough in the face of the viral outbreak , which has brought the U.S. economy to a near-standstill as workers and consumers stay home . Last week , it said it would buy $ 500 billion of Treasuries and $ 200 billion of mortgage-backed securities , then quickly ran through roughly half those amounts by week ’ s end .\nAnd on Monday , the New York Federal Reserve said it would buy $ 75 billion of Treasuries and $ 50 billion of mortgage-backed securities each day this week .\n“ They ’ re really setting the economy up ” to start functioning again when the health crisis subsides , said Donald Kohn , a former Fed vice chair who is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution . “ Part of this is about the other side of the valley : Make sure the credit is there . ’ ’\nKohn noted that it would take time to set up some of the Fed ’ s programs , but just knowing that they are on the way should reassure businesses .\nMany companies seeking loans are worried about cash flow as their revenue dries up along with their customers . Elizabeth Cooper McFadden , who runs Novella Brandhouse , a marketing firm in Kansas City , Missouri , has applied for a disaster loan from the Small Business Administration . But she ’ s concerned about how long that loan will take to be processed and wonders if the Fed program might be faster . She will need more money in the next 30 to 60 days .\nMcFadden would also like to see more lenient terms than SBA loans allow .\n“ We ’ re looking at any and all options , ” she said , adding , hopefully : “ I feel that 90 days from now , it ’ s going to be a different picture — in a positive way . ”\nThe Fed mostly creates the money it will use to buy bonds and lend to large and small businesses . But it seeks to avoid credit losses . It has been using money from a Treasury fund to offset any losses on its loans . That fund has already committed most of that money to the Fed ’ s existing facilities . The congressional legislation could boost that amount by about $ 500 billion .\n“ The steps announced today , combined with the previous ones ... should substantially improve market functioning and should provide some important support for the economy , ” said Roberto Perli , a former Fed economist who is now head of global policy research at Cornerstone Macro .\nBut Perli cautioned that the benefits won ’ t be felt immediately .\n“ The next couple of quarters will still be probably bad , ” he said .\nThe new programs announced Monday by the Fed include two that will buy corporate debt issued by large companies .\nOne program will buy newly issued corporate debt . This is an effort to revive that market , which has effectively come to a standstill . The second will buy previously issued corporate debt . Both programs will include $ 10 billion provided by the Treasury to offset any losses .\nA third new lending program will buy securities backed by packages of auto loans , credit card loans and some small business loans . Lending in those areas hinges on the ability of banks to package those loans into securities and sell them . So the Fed ’ s move is critical to the ability of banks to continue to provide these loans as the economy falters .\nThe Treasury will also provide $ 10 billion to that program to offset any losses . All told , those three programs can lend up to $ 300 billion .\nThe Fed said that companies “ that are expected to receive direct financial assistance under pending federal legislation ” are not eligible to participate in the corporate lending programs — a reference to the airline industry and perhaps others under consideration .\nCompanies will have to be rated at investment grade , or above junk level , to be eligible for lending . The companies can defer payments for up to six months , the Fed said . If they do suspend payment , they are not allowed to buy back their shares or pay dividends , it said .\nThe Fed also said it will soon establish a “ Main Street Business Lending Program ” to support lending to small and medium-sized businesses . But it provided few details and didn ’ t say when that program would begin .\nThat program will likely be funded by and is intended to complement the congressional stimulus legislation , which also includes a provision to provide financing to very small companies . The Fed ’ s Main Street program will target medium-sized businesses , officials said .\nBrusuelas noted that by announcing the Main Street lending program , the Fed had committed to something before a congressional backstop was in place , a virtually unheard-of step .\n“ You ’ re never going to see that again , hopefully , ” he said . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

    "93": "A year ago Donald Trump produced the biggest political upset in modern-day America , but were there historical clues that pointed to his unexpected victory ?\nFlying into Los Angeles , a descent that takes you from the desert , over the mountains , to the outer suburbs dotted with swimming pools shaped like kidneys , always brings on a near narcotic surge of nostalgia .\nThis was the flight path I followed more than 30 years ago , as I fulfilled a boyhood dream to make my first trip to the United States . America had always fired my imagination , both as a place and as an idea . So as I entered the immigration hall , under the winsome smile of America 's movie star president , it was hardly a case of love at first sight .\nMy infatuation had started long before , with Westerns , cop shows , superhero comic strips , and movies such as West Side Story and Grease . Gotham exerted more of a pull than London . My 16-year-old self could quote more presidents than prime ministers . Like so many new arrivals , like so many of my compatriots , I felt an instant sense of belonging , a fealty borne of familiarity .\nEighties America lived up to its billing , from the multi-lane freeways to the cavernous fridges , from the drive-in movie theatres to the drive-through burger joints . I loved the bigness , the boldness , the brashness . Coming from a country where too many people were reconciled to their fate from too early an age , the animating force of the American Dream was not just seductive but unshackling .\nUpward mobility was not a given amongst my schoolmates . The absence of resentment was also striking : the belief success was something to emulate rather than envy . The sight of a Cadillac induced different feelings than the sight of a Rolls Royce .\nIt was 1984 . Los Angeles was hosting the Olympics . The Soviet boycott meant US athletes dominated the medals table more so than usual . McDonald 's had a scratch-card promotion , planned presumably before Eastern bloc countries decided to keep their distance , offering Big Macs , Cokes and fries if Americans won gold , silver or bronze in selected events . So for weeks I feasted on free fast food , a calorific accompaniment to chants of `` USA ! USA ! ''\nThis was the summertime of American resurgence . After the long national nightmare of Vietnam , Watergate and the Iranian hostage crisis , the country demonstrated its capacity for renewal . 1984 , far from being the dystopian hell presaged by George Orwell , was a time of celebration and optimism . Uncle Sam - back then , nobody gave much thought to the country being given a male personification - seemed happy again in his own skin .\nFor millions , it really was `` Morning Again in America '' , the slogan of Ronald Reagan 's re-election campaign . In that year 's presidential election , he buried his Democratic opponent Walter Mondale in a landslide , winning 49 out of 50 states and 58.8 % of the popular vote .\nThe United States could hardly be described as politically harmonious . There was the usual divided government . Republicans retained control of the Senate , but the Democrats kept their stranglehold on the House of Representatives . Reagan 's sunniness was sullied by the launch of his 1980 campaign with a call for `` states ' rights '' , which sounded to many like a dog-whistle for denial of civil rights .\nHis chosen venue was Philadelphia , but not the city of brotherly love , the cradle of the Declaration of Independence , but rather Philadelphia , Mississippi , a rural backwater close to where three civil rights workers had been murdered by white supremacists in 1964 . Reagan , like Nixon , pursued the southern strategy , which exploited white fears about black advance .\nStill , the anthem of the hour was Lee Greenwood 's God Bless the USA and politics was not nearly as polarised as it is today . Even though the Democratic House Speaker Tip O'Neill reviled Reagan 's trickle-down economics - he called him a `` cheerleader for selfishness '' and `` Herbert Hoover with a smile '' - these two Irish-Americans found common ground as they sought to act in the national interest .\nBoth understood the Founding Fathers had hard-wired compromise into the governmental system , and that Washington , with its checks and balances , was unworkable without give and take . They worked together on tax reform and safeguarding Social Security .\nThe country was in the ascendant . Not so paranoid as it was in the 1950s , not so restive as it was in the 1960s , and nowhere near as demoralised as it had been in the 1970s .\nHistory is never neat or linear . Decades do not automatically have personalities , but it is possible to divide the period since 1984 into two distinct phases . The final 16 years of the 20th Century was a time of American hegemony . The first 16 years of the 21st Century has proven to be a period of dysfunction , discontent , disillusionment and decline . The America of today in many ways reflects the dissonance between the two .\nIn those twilight years of the last millennium , America enjoyed something akin to the dominance achieved at the Los Angeles Olympics . Just two years after Reagan demanded that Gorbachev tear down the Berlin Wall , that concrete and ideological barricade was gone . The United States won the Cold War . In the New World Order that emerged afterwards , it became the sole superpower in a unipolar world .\nThe speed at which US-led forces won the first Gulf War in 1991 helped slay the ghosts of Vietnam . With a reformist leader , Boris Yeltsin , installed in the Kremlin , there was an expectation Russia would embrace democratic reform . Even after Tiananmen Square , there was a hope that China might follow suit , as it moved towards a more market-based economy .\nThis was the thrust of Francis Fukuyama 's thesis in his landmark 1989 essay , The End of History , which spoke of `` the universalisation of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government '' .\nFor all the forecasts Japan would become the world 's largest economy , America refused to cede its financial and commercial dominance . Instead of Sony ruling the corporate world , Silicon Valley became the new high-tech workshop of business .\nBill Clinton 's boast of building a bridge to the 21st Century rang true , although it was emergent tech giants such as Microsoft , Apple and Google that were the true architects and engineers . Thirty years after planting the Stars and Stripes on the Sea of Tranquillity , America not only dominated outer space but cyberspace too .\nThis phase of US dominance could never be described as untroubled . The Los Angeles riots in 1992 , sparked by the beating of Rodney King and the acquittal of the police officers charged with his assault , highlighted deep racial divisions .\nIn Washington , Bill Clinton 's impeachment exhibited the hyper-partisanship that was changing the tenor of Washington life . In the age of 24/7 cable news , politics was starting to double as soap opera .\nYet as we approached 31 December 1999 , the assertion that the 20th Century had been The American Century was an axiom . I was in the capital as Bill Clinton presided over the midnight celebrations on the National Mall , and as the fireworks skipped from the Lincoln Memorial down the Reflecting Pool to illuminate the Washington monument , the mighty obelisk looked like a giant exclamation mark or a massive number one .\nThe national story changed dramatically and unexpectedly soon after . While doomsday predictions of a Y2K bug failed to materialise , it nonetheless felt as if the United States had been infected with a virus . 2000 saw the dot-com bubble explode . In November , the disputed presidential election between George W Bush and Al Gore badly damaged the reputation of US democracy .\nWhy , a Zimbabwean diplomat even suggested Africa send international observers to oversee the Florida recount . Beyond America 's borders came harbingers of trouble . In Russia , 31 December 1999 , as those fireworks were being primed , Vladimir Putin took over from Boris Yeltsin .\nThe year 2001 brought the horror of September 11th , an event more traumatic than Pearl Harbor . Post-9/11 America became less welcoming and more suspicious . The Bush administration 's `` war on terror '' - open-ended conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq - drained the country of blood and treasure .\nThe collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 , and the Great Recession that followed , arguably had a more lasting impact on the American psyche than the destruction of the Twin Towers . Just as 9/11 had undermined confidence in the country 's national security , the financial collapse shattered confidence in its economic security .\nWith parents no longer certain their children would come to enjoy more abundant lives than they did , the American Dream felt like a chimera . The American compact , the bargain that if you worked hard and played by the rules your family would succeed , was no longer assumed . Between 2000 and 2011 , the overall net wealth of US households fell . By 2014 , the richest 1 % of Americans had accrued more wealth than the bottom 90 % .\nTo many in the watching world , and most of the 69 million Americans who voted for him , the election of the country 's first black president again demonstrated America 's capacity for regeneration .\nBarack Hussein Obama . His improbable success story seemed uniquely American .\nAlthough his presidency did much to rescue the economy , he could n't repair a fractured country . The creation of a post-partisan nation , which Obama outlined in his breakthrough speech at the 2004 Democratic convention , proved just as illusory as the emergence of a post-racial society , which he always knew was beyond him .\nDuring the Obama years , Washington descended into a level of dysfunction unprecedented in post-war America .\n`` My number one priority is making sure President Obama 's a one-term president , '' declared then-Senate Minority leader Mitch McConnell , summing up the obstructionist mood of his Republican colleagues . It led to a crisis of governance , including the shutdown of 2013 and the repeated battles over raising the debt ceiling . The political map of America , rather than taking on a more purple hue , came to be rendered in deeper shades of red and blue .\nBeyond Capitol Hill , there was a whitelash to the first black president , seen in the rise of the Birther movement and in elements of the Tea Party movement . On the right , movement conservatives challenged establishment Republicans . On the left , identity politics displaced a more class-oriented politics as union influence waned . Both parties seemed to vacate the middle ground , relying instead on maximising support from their respective bases - African-Americans , evangelicals , the LGBT community , gun-owners - to win elections .\nThroughout his presidency , Barack Obama continued to talk about moving towards a more perfect union . But reality made a mockery of these lofty words . Sandy Hook . Orlando . The spate of police shootings . The gang-related mayhem in his adopted home of Chicago . The mess in Washington . The opioid crisis . The health indices even pointed to a sick nation , in which the death rate was rising . By 2016 , life expectancy fell for the first time since 1993 .\nThis was the backdrop against which the 2016 election was fought , one of the most dispiriting campaigns in US political history . A battle between the two most unpopular major party candidates since polling began , ended with a victor who had higher negative ratings than his opponent and in the end , three million fewer votes .\nJust as I had been on the National Mall to ring in the new millennium in 2000 , I was there again on 20 January 2017 , for Donald Trump 's inaugural celebrations . They included some Reagan-era flourishes . At the eve of the inauguration concert , Lee Greenwood reprised his Reaganite anthem God Bless the USA , albeit with a frailer voice .\nThere were chants of `` USA , USA , '' a staple of the billionaire 's campaign rallies - usually triggered by his riff on building a wall along the Mexican border . There was also an 80s vibe about the telegenic first family , who looked fresh from a set of a primetime soap , like Dynasty or Falcon Crest .\nThe spectacle brought to mind what Norman Mailer once said of Reagan , that the 40th president understood `` the President of the United States was the leading soap opera figure in the great American drama , and one had better possess star value '' . Trump understood this , and it explained much of his success , even if his star power came from reality TV rather than Hollywood B-movies .\nYet Trump is not Reagan . His politics of grievance , and the fist-shaking anger it fed off , struck a different tone than the Gipper 's more positive pitch . It played on a shared sense of personal and national victimhood that would have been alien to Reagan .\nIn the space of just three decades , then , the United States had gone from `` It 's morning in America again '' to something much darker : `` American Carnage '' , the most memorable phrase from Trump 's inaugural address .\nIt is tempting to see Trump 's victory this time last year as an aberration . A historical mishap . The election all came down , after all , to just 77,744 votes in three key states : Pennsylvania , Michigan and Wisconsin . But when you consider the boom-to-bust cycle of the period between 1984 and 2016 , the Trump phenomenon does n't look so accidental .\nIn many ways Trump 's unexpected victory marked the culmination of a large number of trends in US politics , society and culture , many of which are rooted in that end-of-century period of American dominion .\nConsider how the fall of the Berlin Wall changed Washington , and how it ushered in an era of destructive and negative politics . In the post-war years , bipartisanship was routine , partly because of a shared determination to defeat communism . America 's two-party system , adversarial though it was , benefited from the existence of a shared enemy . To pass laws , President Eisenhower regularly worked with Democratic chieftains such as House Speaker Sam Rayburn and Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson .\nReforms such as the 1958 National Defense Education Act , which improved science teaching in response to the launch of Sputnik , were framed precisely with defeating communism in mind .\nMuch of the impetus to pass landmark civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s came from the propaganda gift Jim Crow laws handed to the Soviet Union , especially as Moscow sought to expand its sphere of influence among newly decolonised African nations .\nPatriotic bipartisanship frayed and ripped after the end of the Cold War . It was in the 1990s the then-Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole started to use the filibuster more aggressively as a blocking device . Government shutdowns became politically weaponised .\nIn the 1994 congressional mid-terms , the Republican revolution brought a wave of fierce partisans to Washington , with an ideological aversion to government and thus little investment in making it work . House Speaker Newt Gingrich , the first Republican to occupy the post in 40 years , personified the kind of abrasive partisan that came to the fore on Capitol Hill .\nGrudging bipartisanship was still possible , as Clinton and Gingrich demonstrated over welfare and criminal justice reform in the mid-1990s . But this period witnessed the acidification of DC politics . The gerrymandering of the House of Representatives encouraged strict partisanship , because the threat to most lawmakers came from within their own parties . Moderates or pragmatists who strayed from the partisan path were punished with a primary challenge from more doctrinaire rivals .\nBy the 112th Congress in 2011-2012 , there was no Democrat in the House more conservative than a Republican and no Republican more liberal than a Democrat . This was new . In the post-war years , there had been considerable ideological overlap between liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats . In this more polarised climate , bipartisanship became a dirty word . One leading conservative thinker and anti-tax campaigner , Grover Norquist , likened it to date rape .\nWould Congress have impeached Bill Clinton , ostensibly for having an affair with an intern , had America still been waging the Cold War ? I sense not - it would have been seen , in those more serious times , as a frivolous distraction . When Congress moved towards impeaching Richard Nixon it did so because Watergate and its cover-up truly rose to the level of high crimes and misdemeanours .\nClinton 's impeachment signalled the emergence of another new political trend : the delegitimisation of sitting presidents . And both parties played the game . The Democrats cast George W Bush as illegitimate because Al Gore won the popular vote and the Supreme Court controversially ruled in the Republican 's favour during the Florida recount .\nThe Birther movement , led by Donald Trump , tried to delegitimise Barack Obama with specious and racist claims that he was not born in Hawaii . Most recently , the Democrats have cast aspersions on Trump 's victory , partly because he lost the popular vote and partly because they allege he achieved a Kremlin-assisted victory .\nOver this period , the political discourse also became shriller . Rush Limbaugh , after getting his first radio show in 1984 , rose to become the king of the right-wing shock jocks . Fox News was launched in 1996 , the same year as MSNBC , which became its progressive counterpoint . The internet quickened the metabolism of the news industry and became the home for the kind of hateful commentary traditional news outlets rarely published .\nMaybe the Jerry Springerisation of political news coverage can be traced to the moment the Drudge Report first published the name Monica Lewinsky , `` scooping '' Newsweek which hesitated before publishing such an explosive story . The success of the Drudge Report demonstrated how new outlets , which did n't share the same news values as the mainstream media , could establish brands literally overnight . This lesson was doubtless learnt by Andrew Breitbart , an editor at Drudge who founded the right-wing website Breitbart News .\nThe internet and social media , trumpeted initially as the ultimate tool for bringing people together , actually became a forum for cynicism , division and various outlandish conspiracy theories . America became more atomised .\nAs Robert D Putnam identified in his 1995 seminal essay , Bowling Alone , lower participation rates in organisations such as unions , parent teacher associations , the Boy Scouts and women 's clubs had reduced person to person contacts and civil interaction .\nEconomically , this period saw the continuation of what 's been called the `` Great Divergence '' which produced stark inequalities in wealth and income . Between 1979 and 2007 , household income in the top 1 % grew by 275 % compared to just 18 % growth in the bottom fifth of households .\nThe Clinton-era was a period of financial deregulation , including the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act , the landmark reform passed during the depression , as well as legislation exempting credit default swaps from regulation .\nDisruptive technologies changed the workplace and upended the labour market . Automation , more so than globalisation , was the big jobs killer during this phase . Between 1990 and 2007 , machines killed off up to 670,000 US manufacturing jobs alone .\nThe Rust Belt rebellion that propelled Trump to the White House has been described as a revolt against robots , not that his supporters viewed it that way . Encouraged by the billionaire , many blamed increased foreign competition and the influx of foreign workers .\nThe opioid crisis can be traced back to the early 1990s with the over-prescription of powerful painkillers . Between 1991 and 2011 , painkiller prescriptions tripled .\nAmerica seemed intoxicated by its own post-Cold War success . Then came the hangover of the past 16 years .\nOver the past few months , I 've followed that same westward flight path to California on a number of occasions , and found myself asking what would an impressionable 16-year-old make of America now . Would she share my adolescent sense of wonder , or would she peer out over the Pacific at twilight and wonder if the sun was setting on America itself ?\nWhat would she make of the gun violence , brought into grotesque relief again by the Las Vegas massacre ? Multiple shootings are not new , of course . Just days before I arrived in the States in 1984 , a gunman had walked into a McDonalds in a suburb of San Diego and shot dead 21 people . It was then the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history .\nWhat 's different between now and then , however , is the regularity of these massacres , and how the repetitiveness of the killings has normalised them . What was striking about Las Vegas was the muted nationwide response to a gunman killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more .\nOnce-shocking massacres no longer arouse intense emotions for those unconnected to the killings . A month on , and it is almost as if it did n't happen .\nWhat would she make of race relations ? Back in 1984 , black athletes such as Carl Lewis , Edwin Moses and Michael Jordan were unifying figures as they helped reap that Olympic golden harvest . Now some of America 's leading black athletes are vilified by their president for taking a knee to protest , a right enshrined in the First Amendment . These athletes now find themselves combatants in the country 's endless culture wars .\nWhat would she make of the confluence of gun violence and race , evident in the spate of police shootings of unarmed black men and in the online auction where the weapon that killed Trayvon Martin fetched more than $ 100,000 ?\nCharlottesville , with its torch-wielding and hate-spewing neo-Nazis , was another low point . So , too , were the president 's remarks afterwards , when he described the crowd as including some `` very fine people '' and implied a moral equivalence between white supremacists and anti-racist protesters .\nI was at the news conference in Trump Tower that day . An African-American cameraman next to me yelled out `` What message does this send to our children ? '' The question went unanswered , but concerned parents ask it everyday about Donald Trump 's behaviour .\nWhat about the monuments debate ? The last civil war veteran died in 1959 , but the conflict rumbles on in various guises and upon various proxy battlefields , as America continues to grapple with the original sin of slavery .\nBut what if she landed in the American heartland , rather than flying over it ? Coastal separateness can sometimes be exaggerated , but it would be a very different experience than Los Angeles . In the Rust Belt , stretches of riverway are crowded again with coal barges , and local business leaders believe in the Trump Bump because they see it in their order books and balance sheets .\nIn the Coal Belt , there 's been delight at the rescinding of Obama 's Clean Power Plan . In the Bible Belt , evangelicals behold Trump as a fellow victim of sneering liberal elites . In the Sun Belt , close to the Mexican border , there 's wide support for his crackdown on illegal immigration .\nIn many football stadiums , she would hear the chorus of boos from fans who agree with the president that the take-the-knee protests denigrate the flag . In bars , union branches and American Legion halls , you 'll find many who applaud Donald Trump for `` telling like it is '' , refusing to be bound by norms of presidential behaviour or political correctness .\nThere are pointers of national success elsewhere . The New York Stock Exchange is still reaching record highs . Business confidence is on the up . Unemployment is at a 16-year low . Of the 62 million people who voted for Trump , a large number continue to regard him more as a national saviour than a national embarrassment .\nIn many red states , `` Make America Great Again '' echoes just as strongly as it did 12 months ago . Trump has a historically low approval rating of just 35 % , but it 's 78 % among Republicans .\nIn the international realm , it 's plausible foreign adversaries fear the United States more under Trump than Obama , and foreign allies no longer take the country for granted . The so-called Islamic State has been driven from Raqqa . Twenty-five Nato allies have pledged to increase defence spending . Beijing , under pressure from Washington , appears to be exerting more economic leverage over Pyongyang .\nHowever , America First increasingly means America alone , most notably on the Paris climate change accord and the Iranian nuclear deal . Trump has also Twitter-shamed longstanding allies , such as Germany and Australia , and infuriated its closest friend Britain , with rash tweets about crime rates and terror attacks .\nHis labelling of foes such as Kim Jong Un as Little Rocket Man seems juvenile and self-diminishing . It hardly reaches the Reagan standard of `` tear down this wall '' . Indeed , with North Korea , there 's the widespread fear that Trump 's tweet tirades could spark a nuclear confrontation .\nFew countries look anymore to Trump 's America as a global exemplar , the `` city upon a hill '' Reagan spoke of in his farewell address to the nation . The German Chancellor Angela Merkel is routinely described as the leader of the free world , the moniker bestowed on the US president since the days of FDR .\nThe Economist , which trolls Trump almost weekly , has described Chinese President Xi Jinping as the most powerful man in the world . American exceptionalism is now commonly viewed as a negative construct . `` Only in America '' is a term of derision .\nRonald Reagan used to talk of the 11th commandment - No Republican should speak ill of another Republican . So it is worth noting that some of Trump 's most caustic and thoughtful critics have come from within his own party . Senator Jeff Flake called him `` a danger to democracy '' .\nBob Corker described the White House as an `` adult day care centre '' . John McCain , a frequent critic , has railed against `` spurious , half-baked nationalism '' . George W Bush sounded the alarm about bigotry being emboldened and of how politics `` seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication '' , without specifically naming the current president .\nTrump 's determination to be an anti-president has arguably had a vandalising effect on the office of the presidency , and to civil society more broadly . Artists have boycotted the White House reception held ahead of the annual Kennedy Center Awards , a red letter night in the country 's cultural calendar .\nThe Golden State Warriors were disinvited from appearing at the White House after their championship win because of the take-the-knee protest . It 's new for these kinds of commemorations to become contested .\nTrump has even politicised one of the commander-in-chief 's most solemn acts , offering condolences to the families of the fallen . It led to an indecorous row with a war widow . Small wonder long time Washington watchers , on both the right and left , consider this the nastiest and most graceless presidency of the modern era .\nThe corollary is the historical stock of his predecessors is rising . When the five living former presidents appeared together in Texas earlier this month they were greeted like a group of superheroes donning their capes for one final mission . It speaks of these unreal times that George W Bush is spoken of fondly , even wistfully , by long-time liberal foes .\nTrump 's claim he could be just as presidential as Abraham Lincoln is one of the more comical boasts to come from the White House . Then there are the falsehoods , the `` alternative facts '' and attacks on the `` fake media '' - his label for news organisations such as the New York Times and Washington Post , whose reporting has rarely been better . Recently he has even threatened to revoke the licences of networks whose news divisions have published critical stories . To some it has shades of 1984 , but Orwell 's version .\nAs for Morning in America , it has a new connotation - checking Trump 's Twitter for pre-dawn tweets . The president commonly starts the day by lashing out at opponents or mercilessly mocking them . The new normal , it is often called . But it seems more apt to call it the new abnormal .\nThere is an extent to which America is politics-proof and president-proof . However bad things got in Washington , my sense has long been that the US would be rescued by its other vital centres of power . New York , its financial and cultural capital . San Francisco , its tech hub . Boston , its academic first city . Hollywood , its entertainment centre .\nBut Los Angeles is reeling from the Harvey Weinstein revelations , the Uber scandal has shone a harsh light on corporate ethics in the tech sector and the Wells Fargo affair has once again shown Wall Street in a dismal light .\nUS universities dominate global rankings , but its top colleges could hardly be described as engines of intergenerational mobility . A study by the New York Times of 38 colleges , including Yale , Princeton and Dartmouth , showed that students from the top 1 % income bracket occupied more places than the students from the bottom 60 % . Of this year 's intake at Harvard , almost a third were the sons and daughters of alumni .\nAutomation will also continue to be a jobs killer . One study this year predicted that nearly 40 % of US jobs will be lost to computers and machines over the next 15 years . Spending time in the Rust Belt valleys around Pittsburgh last year I was struck by how many taxi and Uber drivers used to work in the steel industry . Now America 's one-time Steel City is a centre of excellence for robotics and where Uber is road testing its driverless cars .\nThere 's still truth in the adage that America is always going to hell , but it never quite gets there . But how that is being tested . Presently , it feels more like a continent than a country , with shared land occupied by warring tribes . Not a failing state but not a united states .\nAs I 've travelled this country , I struggle to identify where Americans will find common political ground . Not in the guns debate . Not in the abortion debate . Not in the healthcare debate . Not even in the singing of the national anthem at American football games . Even a cataclysmic event on the scale of 9/11 failed to unify the country .\nIf anything it sowed the seeds of further division , especially over immigration . Some Americans agree with Donald Trump that arrivals from mainly Muslim countries need to be blocked . Others see that as an American anathema .\nWhen I made my first journey to the US all those years ago I witnessed a coming together . Those Olympic celebrations were in some ways an orgy of nationalism , but there was also a commonality of spirit and purpose . From Gershwin 's Rhapsody in Blue performed on 84 grand pianos to a polyglot team of athletes bedecked with medals .\nFrom the pilot who flew around the LA Coliseum in a jet pack to the customers who left McDonald 's with free Big Macs . There was reason for rejoicing . The present was golden . America felt like America again . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

Protests continued following the death of George Floyd , who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day . ( AP Photo/John Minchillo )\nMINNEAPOLIS ( AP ) — The white Minneapolis police officer who pressed his knee into George Floyd ’ s neck as he begged for air was arrested Friday and charged with murder , and crowds broke overnight curfews imposed to try to stem violent protests over police killings of African Americans that have spread to cities across the U.S .\nOn Minneapolis ’ south side , officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets to drive back crowds of protesters who then set cars and businesses on fire and broke into stores , including some near a police station .\nShortly before midnight , scores of officers on foot and in vehicles moved in to curb the violence a day after city and state leaders faced blowback for their handling of the crisis . Protesters on Thursday torched a police station soon after it was abandoned by police and vandalized dozens of businesses .\nThe Pentagon took the rare step Friday of ordering the Army to put several active-duty U.S. military police units on the ready to deploy to Minneapolis , according to three people with direct knowledge of the orders who did not want their names used because they were not authorized to discuss the preparations .\nBen Hubert , 26 , of Minneapolis , said he wasn ’ t surprised people were breaking curfew and setting fires .\n“ I ’ m outraged , ” he said of the Floyd case . “ But I ’ m also sad . The injustice has been going on for so long . It ’ s been swelling for years . ”\nDowntown , thousands of protesters encircled a police station after the 8 p.m. curfew . “ Prosecute the police ! ” some chanted , and “ Say his name : George Floyd ! ” There was no violence , though some protesters sprayed graffiti on buildings .\nThe renewed protests came after Officer Derek Chauvin , 44 , was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter . He also was accused of ignoring another officer who expressed concerns about Floyd as he lay handcuffed on the ground , pleading that he could not breathe while Chauvin pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes . Floyd , who was black , had been arrested on suspicion of using a counterfeit bill at a store .\nChauvin , who was fired along with three other officers who were at the scene , faces more than 12 years in prison if convicted of murder .\nAn attorney for Floyd ’ s family welcomed the arrest but said he expected a more serious murder charge and wants the other officers arrested , too .\nProsecutor Mike Freeman said more charges were possible , but authorities “ felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator . ”\nAs the night dragged on , more fires erupted on the south side : A Japanese restaurant , a Wells Fargo bank , another restaurant , an Office Depot . Many burned for hours . Mayor Jacob Frey tweeted that firefighters could not respond until areas were secure . He said the city was working with the National Guard and the state to “ provide support in the south . ”\nProtests nationwide have been fueled by outrage over Floyd ’ s death and years of police violence against African Americans . Protesters smashed windows at CNN headquarters in Atlanta , set a police car on fire and struck officers with bottles . Large demonstrations in New York , Houston , Washington , D.C. , and dozens of other cities ranged from people peacefully blocking roads to repeated clashes with police .\n“ You are disgracing our city , ” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told protesters . “ You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country . ”\nPolice were trying to put Floyd in a squad car Monday when he stiffened and fell to the ground , saying he was claustrophobic , a criminal complaint said . Chauvin and Officer Tou Thoa arrived and tried several times to get the struggling Floyd into the car .\nChauvin eventually pulled Floyd out of the car , and the handcuffed Floyd went to the ground face down . Officer J.K. Kueng held Floyd ’ s back and Officer Thomas Lane held his legs while Chauvin put his knee on Floyd ’ s head and neck area , the complaint said .\nWhen Lane asked if Floyd should be rolled onto his side , Chauvin said , “ No , staying put is where we got him. ” Lane said he was “ worried about excited delirium or whatever . ”\nAn autopsy said the combined effects of being restrained , potential intoxicants in Floyd ’ s system and his underlying health issues , including heart disease , likely contributed to his death . It revealed nothing to support strangulation as the cause of death .\nThere were no other details about intoxicants , and toxicology results can take weeks . In the 911 call that drew police , the caller describes the man suspected of paying with counterfeit money as “ awfully drunk and he ’ s not in control of himself . ”\nAfter Floyd apparently stopped breathing , Lane again said he wanted to roll Floyd onto his side . Kueng checked for a pulse and said he could not find one , according to the complaint .\nChauvin had his knee on Floyd ’ s neck for 8 minutes , 46 seconds , including nearly three minutes after Floyd stopped moving and talking , the complaint said .\nChauvin ’ s attorney had no comment when reached by The ███ .\nThe prosecutor highlighted the “ extraordinary speed ” in charging the case four days after Floyd ’ s death and defended himself against questions about why it did not happen sooner . Freeman said his office needed time to gather evidence , including what he called the “ horrible ” video recorded by a bystander .\nNews of the arrest came moments after Minnesota Gov . Tim Walz acknowledged the “ abject failure ” in responding to this week ’ s protests and called for swift justice for the officers . Walz said the state took the lead after the police station burned .\n“ Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire . The fire is still smoldering in our streets . The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain , of anguish unheard , ” Walz said .\nPresident Donald Trump said Friday that he ’ d spoken to Floyd ’ s family and “ expressed my sorrow . ”\nHe called video of the arrest “ just a horrible thing to witness and to watch . It certainly looked like there was no excuse for it . ”\nAttorney Benjamin Crump , who is representing Floyd ’ s family , asked to take custody of Floyd ’ s body for an independent autopsy .\nThe doctor who will do the autopsy is Michael Baden , former chief medical examiner of New York City , who was hired to do an autopsy for Eric Garner , a black man who died in 2014 after New York police placed him in a chokehold and he pleaded that he could not breathe . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

Protests continued following the death of George Floyd , who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day . ( AP Photo/John Minchillo )\nMINNEAPOLIS ( AP ) — Tense protests over the death of George Floyd and other police killings of black people grew Saturday from New York to Tulsa to Los Angeles , with police cars set ablaze and reports of injuries mounting on all sides as the country convulsed through another night of unrest after months of coronavirus lockdowns .\nThe protests , which began in Minneapolis following Floyd ’ s death Monday after a police officer pressed a knee on his neck until he stopped breathing , have left parts of the city a grid of broken windows , burned-out buildings and ransacked stores . The unrest has since become a national phenomenon as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands .\nTens of thousands of people were in the streets across the country , many of them not wearing masks or observing social distancing , raising concerns among health experts about the potential for spreading the coronavirus pandemic at a time when much of the country is in the process of reopening society and the economy .\nAfter a tumultuous Friday , racially diverse crowds held mostly peaceful demonstrations in dozens of cities , though many later descended into violence as had happened the previous night .\nFew corners of America were untouched , from protesters setting fires inside Reno ’ s city hall , to police launching tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo , North Dakota , to shattered windows at police headquarters in Richmond , Virginia .\n— In Indianapolis , police were investigating “ multiple shootings ” downtown , including one that left a person dead , amid the protests . Police gave few details but said no officers were involved .\n— In Washington , the National Guard was deployed outside the White House , where chanting crowds taunted law enforcement officers . Dressed in camouflage and holding shields , the troops stood in a tight line a few yards from the crowd , preventing them from pushing forward . President Donald Trump , who spent much of Saturday in Florida for the SpaceX rocket launch , landed on the lawn in the presidential helicopter at dusk and went inside without speaking to journalists .\n— In Philadelphia , at least 13 officers were injured when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire . Other fires were set throughout downtown .\n— In Salt Lake City , protesters defied a curfew and National Guard troops were deployed by Utah ’ s governor . Demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire , and another vehicle was later set ablaze . Police said six people were arrested and a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat .\n— In Los Angeles , protesters chanted “ Black Lives Matter , ” some within inches of the face shields of officers . Police used batons to move the crowd back and fired rubber bullets . A graffiti-covered police car burned in the street .\n— And in New York City , dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets . A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects . Several people were knocked to the ground , and it was unclear if anyone was hurt .\n“ The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes . They ’ re repeated violent terrorist offenses and people need to stop killing black people , ” Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said .\nNot all protests devolved into violence . In Juneau , Alaska , law enforcement officers joined elected officials and residents at a peaceful protest in front of a giant whale sculpture on the city ’ s waterfront .\n“ We don ’ t tolerate excessive use of force , ” Juneau Police Chief Ed Mercer told the gathering .\nBack in Minneapolis , the city where the protests began , police , state troopers and National Guard members moved in soon after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect to break up protests , firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere .\nThe show of force came after three days when police largely avoided engaging protesters , and after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard troops to Minneapolis and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000 .\n“ The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd , ” said Gov . Tim Walz , who also said local forces had been overmatched the previous day . “ It is about attacking civil society , instilling fear and disrupting our great cities . ”\nMinneapolis ’ streets steadily grew calmer as the night went on , and Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said the tough response would remain as long as it takes to “ quell this situation . ”\n“ l live here . I haven ’ t been able to sleep , ” said Iman Muhammad , whose neighborhood saw multiple fires set Friday night . Muhammad said she sympathized with peaceful protests over Floyd ’ s death but disagreed with the violence : “ Wrong doesn ’ t answer wrong . ”\nTrump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics Saturday night , commending the Guard deployment in Minneapolis , declaring “ No games ! ” and saying police in New York City “ must be allowed to do their job ! ”\nPresumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd ’ s death .\n“ The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest , ” Biden said in a statement Saturday night .\nOvernight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide , including Atlanta , Denver , Los Angeles , Minneapolis and Seattle .\nMore than 1,300 people have been arrested in 16 cities since Thursday , including over 500 Friday in Los Angeles .\nThe unrest comes at a time when most Americans have spent months inside over concerns surrounding the coronavirus , which the president has called an “ invisible enemy. ” The events of the last 72 hours , seen live on national television , have shown the opposite : a sudden pivot to crowds , screaming protesters and burning buildings , and a stark contrast to the empty streets of recent months .\n“ Quite frankly I ’ m ready to just lock people up , ” Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields said at a news conference . Demonstrations there turned violent Friday , and police were arresting protesters Saturday on blocked-off downtown streets . “ Yes , you caught us off balance once . It ’ s not going to happen twice . ”\nThis week ’ s unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King , a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase . The protests of Floyd ’ s killing have gripped many more cities , but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992 , when more than 60 people died , 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested , with property damage topping $ 1 billion .\nMany protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd ’ s death was one more in a litany . It came in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery , a black man who was shot dead after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood , and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work , killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people .\nThe officer who held his knee to Floyd ’ s neck as he begged for air was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter . But many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved .\nTrump stoked the anger on Twitter , saying that if protesters had breached the White House fence , they would “ have been greeted with the most vicious dogs , and most ominous weapons , I have ever seen . ”\nLeaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd ’ s killing and expressed sympathy for protesters ’ concerns . But as the unrest intensified , they spoke of a desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements , despite concerns that could lead to more heavy-handed tactics .\nGovernors in Georgia , Kentucky , Ohio and Texas also activated the National Guard after protests there turned violent .\nPolice in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who climbed between two trailers of a Fed Ex truck and was killed when it drove away . And a person was killed in the area of protests in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone fired shots into an SUV , officers said . Police had initially said someone fired into the crowd from an SUV . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "96": "( ███ ) - In the summer of 2004 , U.S. soldier Greg Walker drove to a checkpoint just outside of Baghdad ’ s Green Zone with his Kurdish bodyguard , Azaz . When he stepped out of his SUV , three Iraqi guards turned him around at gunpoint .\nMark Giaconia , who served for 20 years in the U.S. Army , of which 15 years in the U.S. Special Forces and was embedded with the Kurds in Iraq , poses for a photograph at his house in Herndon , Virginia , U.S. , October 19 , 2019 . Picture taken October 19 , 2019 . ███/Carlos Jasso\nAs he walked back to the vehicle , he heard an AK-47 being racked and a hail of cursing in Arabic and Kurdish . He turned to see Azaz facing off with the Iraqis .\n“ Let us through or I ’ ll kill you all , ” Walker recalled his Kurdish bodyguard telling the Iraqi soldiers , who he described as “ terrified . ”\nHe thought to himself : “ This is the kind of ally and friend I want . ”\nNow retired and living in Portland , Oregon , the 66-year-old former Army Special Forces soldier is among legions of U.S. servicemembers with a deep gratitude and respect for Kurdish fighters they served alongside through the Iraq war and , more recently , conflicts with the Islamic State . So he was “ furious ” when President Donald Trump this month abruptly decided to pull 1,000 U.S. troops from northeast Syria , clearing the way for Turkey to move in on Kurdish-controlled territory .\nWalker ’ s rage was echoed in ███ interviews with a half dozen other current and former U.S. soldiers who have served with Kurdish forces . Mark Giaconia , a 46-year-old former U.S. Army special forces soldier , recalled similar camaraderie with the Kurds he fought with in Iraq more than a decade ago .\n“ I trusted them with my life , ” said Giaconia , who now lives in Herndon , Virginia , after retiring from the Army with 20 years of service . “ I fought with these guys and watched them die for us . ”\nThe Trump administration ’ s decision to “ leave them hanging ” stirred deep emotions , Giaconia said .\nTrump ’ s abrupt decision to pull back U.S. troops from along the Syria-Turkey border allowed Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan to launch an offensive into the region aimed at creating a 20 mile ( 32 km ) “ safe zone ” clear of the Kurdish YPG militia . The Kurdish fighters had been Washington ’ s main ally in the region but the Turkish government regards them as a terrorist group .\nIn the face of criticism from both Democrats and his own Republicans , Trump defended the move , saying that it fulfilled a campaign promise to reduce foreign troop presence and asserting that the Kurds were “ not angels . ”\nThe Kurds pivoted quickly , allying themselves with Syria to try to hold off the Turkish onslaught .\nTrump then sent Vice President Michael Pence to Ankara to negotiate a pause in the fighting that the United States said would allow the Kurds to pull back from the area Turkey aimed to take , and which Turkey said achieved the main goal of the assault it launched Oct. 9 .\nCongressional Republicans - including Senator Lindsey Graham , normally a staunch Trump ally - fretted that the move would risk allowing the Islamic State militant group to resurge .\n“ Congress is going to speak with a very firm , singular voice , ” Graham said at a Thursday news conference to unveil legislation to impose new sanctions on the Turkish government . He said the “ Turkish outrage ” would lead to the re-emergence of Islamic State , the destruction of an ally - the Kurds - and eventually benefit Iran at the expense of Israel .\nThe House of Representatives voted 354 to 60 last week to condemn Trump ’ s decision to withdraw U.S. forces from northeastern Syria - a rare case of Republicans voting en masse against Trump . A Senate vote on the resolution was blocked , however , by Republican Senator Rand Paul .\nPaul , a senator from Kentucky , has voiced his support Trump ’ s withdrawal of troops , saying during a Senate hearing on Thursday that “ the Constitution is quite clear , no authorization has ever been given for the use of forces in Syria . ”\nSome of the U.S. soldiers interviewed by ███ pointed out that the United States has history of forging alliances with Kurdish forces only to later abandon them . In the 1970s , the administration of President Richard Nixon secretly agreed to funnel money to Iraqi Kurds fighting for autonomy from Iraq , only to drop that aid after Iraq and Iran reached a peace treaty to end border disputes in 1975 .\nLikewise after the 1991 Gulf War , a Kurdish uprising against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein eventually led to a brutal crackdown after U.S. forces left the region .\nThose incidents came up often among Kurds who fought alongside a U.S. Army soldier who did several tours in the Middle East .\n“ Even then , they were bringing up the 1991 betrayal of the Kurds . This idea of betraying the Kurds was something that was very , very front of mind , ” said the soldier , who spoke on the condition of anonymity since he is still in the military . “ There was definitely some skepticism of our support of them long term . ”\nKurds have come to know betrayal , said Kardos Dargala , a 38-year-old Iraqi Kurd whose relationship with the U.S. military dates back to 2004 and the second U.S. invasion of Iraq .\n“ Feeling betrayed , throughout history it is a very familiar pattern , ” said Dargala , who worked as a security contractor for the U.S. military until 2008 - when he immigrated to the United States , joined the U.S. Army , and was deployed to Afghanistan .\nDargala , a U.S. citizen , was injured multiple times in combat . He returned to Iraq earlier this year to spend time with family members who are unable to travel to the United States .\nThe president ’ s withdrawal of troops from Syria left him in disbelief . Dargala said Trump ’ s decision ran counter to U.S. values and interests and sent the wrong message to its allies .\n“ The path the president is on , ” he said , “ is a very destructive path . ” \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

Hiring in the United States jumped in February 2020 as employers added a robust 273,000 jobs , evidence that the economy was in strong shape before the coronavirus began to sweep through the nation . ( AP Photo/Keith Srakocic , File )\nWASHINGTON ( AP ) — Hiring in the United States jumped in February as employers added 273,000 positions , evidence that the job market was in strong shape before the coronavirus began to sweep through the nation .\nThe Labor Department said Friday that the unemployment rate fell to 3.5 % last month , matching a 50-year low , down from 3.6 % in January .\nThe monthly job gain comes from a survey of payrolls done in the second week of February , predating the viral outbreak . Still , many economists were encouraged by the message that the jobs report sent about the economy ’ s health before the disease .\n“ The U.S. economy clearly approached the COVID-19 shock with a head of steam , which is good news , ” said Neil Dutta , an economist at investment strategy firm Renaissance Macro Research . “ You want to be in a position of strength when a crisis hits . ”\nSo far , there are few signs that the job market has been affected by the disease , but most economists expect hiring to slow in the coming months . Businesses are restricting business travel , factories are facing supply disruptions from manufacturing shutdowns in China and some Americans are delaying vacations .\n“ The outbreak will likely lead ( businesses ) to postpone some hiring plans or even shed jobs if the situation worsens , ” said Lydia Boussour , senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics .\nWage growth slowed slightly in February , rising 3 % compared with a year earlier , down from a 3.1 % year-over-year average gain in January . Paychecks have grown at a 3 % pace or higher for more than a year and a half but have slowed since reaching 3.5 % last summer .\nThe government on Friday also upgraded its estimate of job growth in December and January by a combined 85,000 more than it had previously reported . Over the past three months , U.S. employers have added 243,000 jobs — the best quarterly pace since September 2016 .\nUnseasonably warm weather in February likely boosted hiring in the construction industry , which added 42,000 jobs , and hotels and restaurants , which gained nearly 50,000 .\nManufacturing added 15,000 , reversing a sharp loss in January . The gain may not be replicated in the coming months because of supply chain disruptions in China . Last month ’ s totals include 7,000 temporary Census jobs that were created to help compile the 2020 count .\nTom Gimbel , CEO of the LaSalle Network , a Chicago-based employment agency , said that so far , his clients haven ’ t cut back on hiring . Nor are they canceling job interviews , he said , as some did in the run-up to past recessions .\n“ Some clients got a little nervous and moved to video interviews , but job candidates were still willing to come in face to face , ” he said .\nIf employers were to start slashing jobs as a consequence of the virus , it could significantly escalate the economic damage . For that reason , a range of job market barometers will provide some of the most vital signals about how the economy is withstanding the virus ’ impact .\nWidespread layoffs can transform slowdowns in just one or two sectors — the travel industry , say , or manufacturing — into a full-blown downturn for the overall economy . When workers lose jobs and pay , they typically cut spending . Their friends and relatives who are still employed grow anxious about their own jobs and wary of spending freely , a cycle that can trigger further job cuts .\nSo long as monthly job gains remain above 100,000 or so , the unemployment rate should stay low and the economy may be able to avoid a downturn . If the monthly pace were to sink below that level for a sustained period , joblessness would likely rise .\nBefore the viral outbreak struck China , the economy was expanding at a steady pace . Annual growth was 2.1 % in the final three months of last year .\nA pickup in housing sales has supported growth , with ultra-low mortgage rates helping more buyers afford a purchase . And consumer spending , fueled by solid pay increases , has lifted online retailers , restaurants , and the broader economy .\nThe timeliest gauge of layoffs is the government ’ s weekly report on applications for unemployment benefits . People who are laid off are eligible for the aid . The latest data , issued Thursday , was reassuring : It showed that the number of people seeking unemployment benefits dropped 3,000 to 216,000 in the week that ended Feb. 29 . That is roughly the same as the average over the past month and is a very low level historically .\nOther job market gauges are also still unaffected . The jobs website Indeed ’ s data shows that companies have yet to cut their job postings , according to Tara Sinclair , an economist at the company , evidence that they are still willing to hire .\nShould coronavirus worries start to depress consumer and business confidence , a broader pullback in spending and hiring could then weaken the economy .\nSo far , that evidence is mixed . A consumer confidence survey by survey research company Morning Consult has already shown clear declines . But a separate survey of small businesses by the National Federation for Independent Business found that about one-fifth of small companies in February planned to add jobs , unchanged from the previous month .\nA survey of the Fed ’ s business contacts released Wednesday , known as the Beige Book , found that half the bank ’ s 12 districts were reporting consequences from the coronavirus . The Philadelphia Federal Reserve reported fewer tourist groups from China and said many of the city ’ s Asian restaurants and shops had reported declining foot traffic because of unfounded fears over the virus . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

( Hennepin County Sheriff 's Office via AP )\nMINNEAPOLIS ( AP ) — Prosecutors charged three more police officers Wednesday in the death of George Floyd and filed a new , tougher charge against the officer at the center of the case , delivering a victory to protesters who have filled the streets from coast to coast to fight police brutality and racial injustice .\nThe most serious charge was filed against Derek Chauvin , who was caught on video pressing his knee to Floyd ’ s neck and now must defend himself against an accusation of second-degree murder . The three other officers at the scene were charged for the first time with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter .\nAll four were fired last week . If convicted , they could be sentenced to up to four decades in prison .\nChauvin was initially charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter . Those charges still stand .\nThe new second-degree murder charge alleges that Chauvin caused Floyd ’ s death without intent while committing another felony , namely third-degree assault . It carries a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison , compared with a maximum of 25 years for third-degree murder .\nThe other officers — Thomas Lane , J. Kueng and Tou Thao — face the same maximum penalties for aiding and abetting . All three men were in custody by Wednesday evening . Chauvin was arrested last week and is still being held .\nThe multiple charges against each officer would offer a jury more options to find them guilty .\nThe charges were sought by Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison , who called the protests unleashed by the death “ dramatic and necessary ” and said Floyd “ should be here and he is not . ”\n“ His life had value , and we will seek justice , ” said Ellison , who cautioned that winning convictions would be hard and said that public pressure had no bearing on his decisions .\nHundreds of protesters were in New York City ’ s Washington Square Park when the charges were announced .\n“ It ’ s not enough , ” protester Jonathan Roldan said , insisting all four officers should have been charged from the start . “ Right now , we ’ re still marching because it ’ s not enough that they got arrested . There needs to be systematic change . ”\nBen Crump , an attorney for Floyd ’ s family , called it “ a bittersweet moment ” and “ a significant step forward on the road to justice. ” Crump said Elison had told the family he would continue his investigation into Floyd ’ s death and upgrade the charge to first-degree murder if warranted .\nThe move by prosecutors punctuated an unprecedented week in modern American history , in which largely peaceful protests took place in communities of all sizes but were rocked by bouts of violence , including deadly attacks on officers , rampant thefts and arson in some places .\nNationwide , more than 9,000 have been arrested in connection with unrest . At least 12 deaths have been reported , though the circumstances in many cases are still being sorted out .\nMinnesota Gov . Tim Walz , speaking after the new charges were announced , said the state and nation need to “ seize the moment ” and use the wrenching events of the past week to confront the effects of racism , including unequal educational and economic opportunities .\n“ I think this is probably our last shot , as a state and as a nation , to fix this systemic issue , ” he said at a news conference .\nAlso Wednesday , the Hennepin County Medical Examiner ’ s Office released the full autopsy report on Floyd , which noted he had previously tested positive for COVID-19 , but was apparently asymptomatic . The report was released with the family ’ s permission after summary findings Monday that said he had a heart attack while being restrained by officers .\nPresident Donald Trump has pushed the nation ’ s governors to take a hard line against the violence . He again tweeted Wednesday : “ LAW & ORDER ! ”\nAn overpowering security force — including officers from the FBI Hostage Rescue Team , the Secret Service , the Drug Enforcement Administration , the Bureau of Prisons and , according to a senior defense official , at least 2,200 National Guard soldiers — was out in force Wednesday as thousands of peaceful protesters demonstrated in the nation ’ s capital . Some remained near the White House while others marched toward the Capitol building .\nMilitary vehicles were parked on streets near the White House , and an array of agencies kept watch from the air . An FBI plane , an Army surveillance plane and a Park Police helicopter circled overhead .\nAt one point near the White House , protesters began singing “ Amazing Grace ” as they knelt in view of law enforcement officers in riot gear . “ We are not going anywhere ! ” they chanted . There were no signs of confrontations .\nProtester Jade Jones , 30 , said the demonstrations would continue despite the new charges .\n“ That ’ s the least they could do , ” said Jones , who had been attending Washington protests for days . “ It ’ s not going to wipe away 400 years of pain . ”\n“ We are glad there are additional charges , but that doesn ’ t mean justice has been served , ” she said .\nMore than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence .\nIn New York City , where high-end stores were looted in earlier days , some retailers fortified their property . At the luxury department store Saks Fifth Avenue , windows were boarded up , then covered in chain-link fencing and razor wire . The front of the store was guarded by a line of tattooed men with dogs . There was scuffling in some parts of the city Wednesday night , but no signs of major clashes between protesters and police .\nIn Greece , police fired tear gas after young people attacked them Wednesday outside the U.S. Embassy in Athens . Some 4,000 protesters had been peaceful until near the end of the demonstration , when some threw gasoline bombs and stones at police . No injuries or arrests were reported . Other protests were held Wednesday in London , Helsinki , Rotterdam and Bogota , among other cities .\nThe anger over Floyd ’ s death has spilled into an array of racial issues across the U.S .\nIn Philadelphia , for example , a statue of former Mayor Frank Rizzo was removed by the city Wednesday after repeatedly being targeted by vandals . Rizzo presided over a police force widely accused of racism and brutality in the 1970s .\nIn Virginia , Gov . Ralph Northam was expected to announce plans Thursday for the removal of an iconic statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from Richmond ’ s prominent Monument Avenue , a senior administration official told The ███ . The statue in the former Confederate capital has been the target of vandalism during the protests . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "99": "WASHINGTON ( ███ ) - U.S. President Donald Trump appealed to Attorney General Jeff Sessions to end an investigation into Russia ’ s role in the 2016 election , drawing a rebuke from his fellow Republicans in Congress who said the probe must go on .\nIt was Trump ’ s most direct call for his top U.S. law enforcement officer to shut down Special Counsel Robert Mueller ’ s criminal investigation and Democrats promptly accused the president of trying to obstruct justice . Trump ’ s remark coincided with the start of the trial this week of his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort on charges arising from Mueller ’ s inquiry .\nIn a series of tweets , Trump called a “ TOTAL HOAX ” the idea his campaign worked with Moscow , which Mueller is examining . “ This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now , before it continues to stain our country any further , ” he said .\nSince his surprise election in November 2016 , Republican Trump has chafed at any suggestion that the Russian interference might have helped him win the White House . And while he has long maligned Mueller and the investigation , his tweet on Wednesday was an extraordinary bid to try to influence the course of an inquiry hanging over his presidency .\nIn any case , Sessions recused himself from the investigation in March 2017 and does not have the power to stop it .\nThe White House said the tweet was not an order to Sessions and that Trump was expressing his frustration with the length of the probe .\n“ It ’ s not an order . It ’ s the president ’ s opinion , ” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told a news briefing . She denied that Trump was trying to obstruct the probe . “ He ’ s fighting back , ” she said .\nTrump ’ s personal lawyer , Rudy Giuliani , said Trump was expressing an opinion long espoused by his team .\nSome U.S. lawmakers said shutting down the investigation early would be a mistake .\nTrump also said that Mueller is “ totally conflicted. ” He provided no evidence that the team led by Mueller , a Republican who was appointed by a Republican , is biased against him .\nPeter Carr , spokesman for the special counsel ’ s office , declined to comment on Trump ’ s Twitter post . A Justice Department spokeswoman said the department had no comment .\nTrump has steadily attacked Sessions for recusing himself . Sessions cited his role as a senior adviser to Trump ’ s presidential campaign and appointed Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to oversee the investigation .\nRosenstein in turn appointed Mueller and is the person with the authority to fire him .\nMueller , a Republican and former FBI director who served a Republican and Democratic president , has broad support in Congress , where Republicans control both chambers .\nSix Republican senators going into a vote on Wednesday disapproved of Trump ’ s tweet calling for an end to the probe .\n“ They ought to let them conclude their work . What they ’ re doing is something that is important and we support and I don ’ t think any effort to truncate that or somehow shut it down early is in the public ’ s best interest , ” said Senator John Thune .\nSenator Orrin Hatch said he did not think Sessions had the power to end the probe and it would be unwise to do so .\nAn element of Mueller ’ s investigation includes whether Trump or anyone in the campaign tried to obstruct justice . The New York Times reported last week that Mueller ’ s office was examining negative tweets and statements by Trump about Sessions and former FBI Director James Comey . Trump fired Comey in May 2017 .\nU.S. intelligence agencies concluded last year that Moscow meddled in the 2016 campaign to try to tip the vote in Trump ’ s favor . Moscow has denied such interference , and Trump has denied any collusion by his campaign or any obstruction of justice .\nSenator Dianne Feinstein , the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee , said after Trump ’ s tweet , “ It ’ s clear to me he ’ s very worried about it and he wants to prevent it any way he can . ”\nIn April , the committee approved legislation to protect Mueller but Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell said there was no need to advance the bill because he did not believe Trump would fire Mueller .\nSome legal analysts said Wednesday ’ s tweet alone was not enough to bring an obstruction of justice charge but it could be used to establish a pattern of conduct revealing Trump ’ s intentions .\n“ It is a piece of evidence . It is part and parcel with the other 94 things the man has done that show obstruction of justice , ” said Paul Rosenzweig , a former prosecutor who was part of a team that investigated President Bill Clinton .\nJens David Ohlin , a law professor at Cornell University , said the tweets would likely not be seen as an order to Sessions , but as “ Trump venting his continued frustration with the fact that he can ’ t control the Russia investigation . ” \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "100": "US President Donald Trump has once again criticised London Mayor Sadiq Khan , calling him a `` national disgrace '' who is destroying the UK 's capital .\nHis comments came after five violent attacks in London in less than 24 hours left three men dead and three injured .\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it was `` absolutely awful '' Mr Trump was using the `` tragedy of people being murdered to attack the mayor '' .\nPolice have increased patrols in the capital following the attacks .\nRetweeting a post by right-wing commentator Katie Hopkins about this weekend 's violence in London , the president said Mr Khan was `` a disaster '' and the capital needed a new mayor .\nMr Trump later followed it up with another post saying : `` He is a national disgrace who is destroying the city of London ! ''\nIn response , Mr Khan 's spokesman said the mayor 's thoughts were with the victims ' families and he `` is not going to waste his time responding to this sort of tweet '' .\nThe mayor was focused on supporting the city 's communities and `` over-stretched '' emergency services , he added .\nMr Khan later tweeted : `` Violent crime has no place in our city , and there 's no higher priority for me than Londoners ' safety . ''\nMr Corbyn tweeted in defence of Mr Khan , saying he was `` rightly supporting the police to do their job while Katie Hopkins spreads hateful and divisive rhetoric '' .\nThese three deaths take the total number of homicides in London in 2019 to 56 . Official data shows that this time last year there had been 82 deaths - and 2018 was ultimately the worst year on record in the city for a decade .\nHow do these figures compare to other places ? Donald Trump 's home city of New York is often regarded as a comparable city because it has a similar population and shares other characteristics too .\nFigures from the Metropolitan Police show 136 homicides were recorded in Greater London in 2018 . That works out as a rate of approximately 1.5 killings for every 100,000 people who live in the capital .\nNew York Police Department statistics show its per capita murder rate was twice as high .\nMonth-by-month statistics can mislead because crimes do n't occur at regular intervals - but this year 's rate for New York is , so far , also double London 's .\nNew York is by no means the US 's most dangerous city - there are many others which have far higher murder rates .\nPolice have made 17 arrests - including several boys and a girl - following the five separate attacks .\nThe first attack was on Friday afternoon in Wandsworth , south London , where an 18-year-old man was stabbed to death .\nTen minutes later 19-year-old Eniola Aluko was shot dead in Plumstead , south-east London .\nTwo teenagers have since been charged with the murder of the man in Wandsworth , while five people have been arrested on suspicion of Mr Aluko 's murder .\nA man in his 30s died after he was stabbed in Tower Hamlets on Saturday afternoon .\nIn the early hours of Saturday two men were stabbed in Clapham and another was stabbed in Brixton .\nDeputy Assistant Commissioner Matthew Twist , from the Metropolitan Police , said : `` The circumstances , causes and motives for any homicide or serious violence incident are different and unique , and require different investigative strategies and approaches .\n`` But we are taking a service-wide response and all officers right across London continue to be relentless in our pursuit of those who bring violence to our communities . ''\nPresident Trump and Mr Khan have clashed many times in the past .\nThe president called Mr Khan a `` stone cold loser who should focus on crime in London '' shortly before landing in Stansted ahead of his three-day state visit to the UK earlier this month .\nIt followed comments from the mayor of London that the UK should not be `` rolling out the red carpet '' for Mr Trump during his visit .\nIn the past Mr Trump has challenged Mr Khan to an IQ test and been critical of his response to the London Bridge attack in 2017 . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "101": "Judge Les Hayes once sentenced a single mother to 496 days behind bars for failing to pay traffic tickets . The sentence was so stiff it exceeded the jail time Alabama allows for negligent homicide .\nMarquita Johnson , who was locked up in April 2012 , says the impact of her time in jail endures today . Johnson ’ s three children were cast into foster care while she was incarcerated . One daughter was molested , state records show . Another was physically abused .\n“ Judge Hayes took away my life and didn ’ t care how my children suffered , ” said Johnson , now 36 . “ My girls will never be the same . ”\nFellow inmates found her sentence hard to believe . “ They had a nickname for me : The Woman with All the Days , ” Johnson said . “ That ’ s what they called me : The Woman with All the Days . There were people who had committed real crimes who got out before me . ”\nIn 2016 , the state agency that oversees judges charged Hayes with violating Alabama ’ s code of judicial conduct . According to the Judicial Inquiry Commission , Hayes broke state and federal laws by jailing Johnson and hundreds of other Montgomery residents too poor to pay fines . Among those jailed : a plumber struggling to make rent , a mother who skipped meals to cover the medical bills of her disabled son , and a hotel housekeeper working her way through college .\nHayes , a judge since 2000 , admitted in court documents to violating 10 different parts of the state ’ s judicial conduct code . One of the counts was a breach of a judge ’ s most essential duty : failing to “ respect and comply with the law . ”\nDespite the severity of the ruling , Hayes wasn ’ t barred from serving as a judge . Instead , the judicial commission and Hayes reached a deal . The former Eagle Scout would serve an 11-month unpaid suspension . Then he could return to the bench .\nUntil he was disciplined , Hayes said in an interview with ███ , “ I never thought I was doing something wrong . ”\nThis week , Hayes is set to retire after 20 years as a judge . In a statement to ███ , Hayes said he was “ very remorseful ” for his misdeeds .\nCommunity activists say his departure is long overdue . Yet the decision to leave , they say , should never have been his to make , given his record of misconduct .\n“ He should have been fired years ago , ” said Willie Knight , pastor of North Montgomery Baptist Church . “ He broke the law and wanted to get away with it . His sudden retirement is years too late . ”\nHayes is among thousands of state and local judges across America who were allowed to keep positions of extraordinary power and prestige after violating judicial ethics rules or breaking laws they pledged to uphold , a ███ investigation found .\nJudges have made racist statements , lied to state officials and forced defendants to languish in jail without a lawyer – and then returned to the bench , sometimes with little more than a rebuke from the state agencies overseeing their conduct .\nRecent media reports have documented failures in judicial oversight in South Carolina , Louisiana and Illinois . ███ went further .\nIn the first comprehensive accounting of judicial misconduct nationally , ███ reviewed 1,509 cases from the last dozen years – 2008 through 2019 – in which judges resigned , retired or were publicly disciplined following accusations of misconduct . In addition , reporters identified another 3,613 cases from 2008 through 2018 in which states disciplined wayward judges but kept hidden from the public key details of their offenses – including the identities of the judges themselves .\nAll told , 9 of every 10 judges were allowed to return to the bench after they were sanctioned for misconduct , ███ determined . They included a California judge who had sex in his courthouse chambers , once with his former law intern and separately with an attorney ; a New York judge who berated domestic violence victims ; and a Maryland judge who , after his arrest for driving drunk , was allowed to return to the bench provided he took a Breathalyzer test before each appearance .\nThe news agency ’ s findings reveal an “ excessively ” forgiving judicial disciplinary system , said Stephen Gillers , a law professor at New York University who writes about judicial ethics . Although punishment short of removal from the bench is appropriate for most misconduct cases , Gillers said , the public “ would be appalled at some of the lenient treatment judges get ” for substantial transgressions .\nIn Utah , a judge texted a video of a man ’ s scrotum to court clerks . He was reprimanded but remains on the bench .\nIn Indiana , three judges attending a conference last spring got drunk and sparked a 3 a.m. brawl outside a White Castle fast-food restaurant that ended with two of the judges shot . Although the state supreme court found the three judges had “ discredited the entire Indiana judiciary , ” each returned to the bench after a suspension .\nIn Texas , a judge burst in on jurors deliberating the case of a woman charged with sex trafficking and declared that God told him the defendant was innocent . The offending judge received a warning and returned to the bench . The defendant was convicted after a new judge took over the case .\n“ There are certain things where there should be a level of zero tolerance , ” the jury foreman , Mark House , told ███ . The judge should have been fined , House said , and kicked off the bench . “ There is no justice , because he is still doing his job . ”\nJudicial misconduct specialists say such behavior has the potential to erode trust in America ’ s courts and , absent tough consequences , could give judges license to behave with impunity .\n“ When you see cases like that , the public starts to wonder about the integrity and honesty of the system , ” said Steve Scheckman , a lawyer who directed Louisiana ’ s oversight agency and served as deputy director of New York ’ s . “ It looks like a good ol ’ boys club . ”\nThat ’ s how local lawyers viewed the case of a longtime Alabama judge who concurrently served on the state ’ s judicial oversight commission . The judge , Cullman District Court ’ s Kim Chaney , remained on the bench for three years after being accused of violating the same nepotism rules he was tasked with enforcing on the oversight commission . In at least 200 cases , court records show , Judge Chaney chose his own son to serve as a court-appointed defense lawyer for the indigent , enabling the younger Chaney to earn at least $ 105,000 in fees over two years .\nIn February , months after ███ repeatedly asked Chaney and the state judicial commission about those cases , he retired from the bench as part of a deal with state authorities to end the investigation .\nTommy Drake , the lawyer who first filed a complaint against Chaney in 2016 , said he doubts the judge would have been forced from the bench if ███ hadn ’ t examined the case .\n“ You know the only reason they did anything about Chaney is because you guys started asking questions , ” Drake said . “ Otherwise , he ’ d still be there . ”\nState and local judges draw little scrutiny even though their courtrooms are the bedrock of the American criminal justice system , touching the lives of millions of people every year .\nThe country ’ s approximately 1,700 federal judges hear 400,000 cases annually . The nearly 30,000 state , county and municipal court judges handle a far bigger docket : more than 100 million new cases each year , from traffic to divorce to murder . Their titles range from justice of the peace to state supreme court justice . Their powers are vast and varied – from determining whether a defendant should be jailed to deciding who deserves custody of a child .\nEach U.S. state has an oversight agency that investigates misconduct complaints against judges . The authority of the oversight agencies is distinct from the power held by appellate courts , which can reverse a judge ’ s legal ruling and order a new trial . Judicial commissions can not change verdicts . Rather , they can investigate complaints about the behavior of judges and pursue discipline ranging from reprimand to removal .\nFew experts dispute that the great majority of judges behave responsibly , respecting the law and those who appear before them . And some contend that , when judges do falter , oversight agencies are effective in identifying and addressing the behavior . “ With a few notable exceptions , the commissions generally get it right , ” said Keith Swisher , a University of Arizona law professor who specializes in judicial ethics .\nOthers disagree . They note that the clout of these commissions is limited , and their authority differs from state to state . To remove a judge , all but a handful of states require approval of a panel that includes other judges . And most states seldom exercise the full extent of those disciplinary powers .\nAs a result , the system tends to err on the side of protecting the rights and reputations of judges while overlooking the impact courtroom wrongdoing has on those most affected by it : people like Marquita Johnson .\n███ scoured thousands of state investigative files , disciplinary proceedings and court records from the past dozen years to quantify the personal toll of judicial misconduct . The examination found at least 5,206 people who were directly affected by a judge ’ s misconduct . The victims cited in disciplinary documents ranged from people who were illegally jailed to those subjected to racist , sexist and other abusive comments from judges in ways that tainted the cases .\nThe number is a conservative estimate . The tally doesn ’ t include two previously reported incidents that affected thousands of defendants and prompted sweeping reviews of judicial conduct .\n“ If we have a system that holds a wrongdoer accountable but we fail to address the victims , then we are really losing sight of what a justice system should be all about . ”\nIn Pennsylvania , the state examined the convictions of more than 3,500 teenagers sentenced by two judges . The judges were convicted of taking kickbacks as part of a scheme to fill a private juvenile detention center . In 2009 , the Pennsylvania Supreme Court appointed senior judge Arthur Grim to lead a victim review , and the state later expunged criminal records for 2,251 juveniles . Grim told ███ that every state should adopt a way to compensate victims of judicial misconduct .\n“ If we have a system that holds a wrongdoer accountable but we fail to address the victims , then we are really losing sight of what a justice system should be all about , ” Grim said .\nIn another review underway in Ohio , state public defender Tim Young is scrutinizing 2,707 cases handled by a judge who retired in 2018 after being hospitalized for alcoholism . Mike Benza , a law professor at Case Western Reserve University whose students are helping identify victims , compared the work to current investigations into police abuse of power . “ You see one case and then you look to see if it 's systemic , ” he said .\nThe review , which has been limited during the coronavirus pandemic , may take a year . But Young said the time-consuming task is essential because “ a fundamental injustice may have been levied against hundreds or thousands of people . ”\nMost states afford judges accused of misconduct a gentle kind of justice . Perhaps no state better illustrates the shortcomings of America ’ s system for overseeing judges than Alabama .\nAs in most states , Alabama ’ s nine-member Judicial Inquiry Commission is a mix of lawyers , judges and laypeople . All are appointed . Their deliberations are secret and they operate under some of the most judge-friendly rules in the nation .\nAlabama ’ s rules make even filing a complaint against a judge difficult . The complaint must be notarized , which means that in theory , anyone who makes misstatements about the judge can be prosecuted for perjury . Complaints about wrongdoing must be made in writing ; those that arrive by phone , email or without a notary stamp are not investigated , although senders are notified why their complaints have been summarily rejected . Anonymous written complaints are shredded .\nThese rules can leave lawyers and litigants fearing retaliation , commission director Jenny Garrett noted in response to written questions .\n“ It ’ s a ridiculous system that protects judges and makes it easy for them to intimidate anyone with a legitimate complaint , ” said Sue Bell Cobb , chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court from 2007 to 2011 . In 2009 , she unsuccessfully championed changes to the process and commissioned an American Bar Association report that offered a scathing review of Alabama 's rules .\nIn most other states , commission staff members can start investigating a judge upon receiving a phone call or email , even anonymous ones , or after learning of questionable conduct from a news report or court filing . In Alabama , staff will not begin an investigation without approval from the commission itself , which convenes about every seven weeks .\nBy rule , the commission also must keep a judge who is under scrutiny fully informed throughout an investigation . If a subpoena is issued , the judge receives a simultaneous copy , raising fears about witness intimidation . If a witness gives investigators a statement , the judge receives a transcript . In the U.S. justice system , such deference to individuals under investigation is extremely rare .\n“ It ’ s a ridiculous system that protects judges and makes it easy for them to intimidate anyone with a legitimate complaint . ”\n“ Why the need for special rules for judges ? ” said Michael Levy , a Washington lawyer who has represented clients in high-profile criminal , corporate , congressional and securities investigations . “ If judges think it ’ s fair and appropriate to investigate others for crimes or misconduct without providing those subjects or targets with copies of witness statements and subpoenas , why don ’ t judges think it ’ s fair to investigate judges in the same way ? ”\nAlabama judges also are given an opportunity to resolve investigations confidentially . ███ interviews and a review of Alabama commission records show the commission has met with judges informally at least 19 times since 2011 to offer corrective “ guidance. ” The identities of those judges remain confidential , as does the conduct that prompted the meetings . “ Not every violation warrants discipline , ” commission director Garrett said .\nSince 2008 , the commission has brought 21 public cases against judges , including Hayes , charging two this year .\nTwo of the best-known cases brought by the commission involved Roy Moore , who was twice forced out as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court for defying federal court orders .\nAnother Alabama justice fared better in challenging a misconduct complaint , however . Tom Parker , first elected to the state ’ s high court in 2004 , pushed back when the commission investigated him in 2015 for comments he made on the radio criticizing the U.S. Supreme Court 's decision legalizing gay marriage .\nParker sued the commission in federal court , arguing the agency was infringing on his First Amendment rights . He won . Although the commission had dropped its investigation before the ruling , it was ordered to cover Parker ’ s legal fees : $ 100,000 , or about a fifth of the agency ’ s total annual budget .\nIn 2018 , the people of Alabama elected Parker chief justice .\nThese days , Parker told ███ , Alabama judges and the agency that oversees them enjoy “ a much better relationship ” that ’ s less politically tinged . “ How can I say it ? It ’ s much more respectful between the commission and the judges now . ”\nMontgomery , Alabama has a deep history of racial conflict , as reflected in the clashing concepts emblazoned on the city ’ s great seal : “ Cradle of the Confederacy ” and “ Birthplace of the Civil Rights Movement . ”\nJefferson Davis was inaugurated here as Confederate president after the South seceded from the Union in 1861 , and his birthday is a state holiday . As was common throughout the South , the city was the site of the lynchings of Black men , crimes now commemorated at a national memorial based here . Police arrested civil rights icon Rosa Parks here in 1955 for refusing to give up her seat on a city bus to a white passenger .\nToday , about 60 % of Montgomery ’ s 198,000 residents are Black , U.S. census records show . Even so , Black motorists account for about 90 % of those charged with unpaid traffic tickets , a ███ examination of court records found . Much of Judge Hayes ’ work in municipal court involved traffic cases and the collection of fines . Hayes , who is white , told ███ that “ the majority of people who come before the court are Black . ”\nCity officials have said that neither race nor economics have played a role in police efforts to enforce outstanding warrants , no matter how minor the offense .\nIn April 2012 , Marquita Johnson was among them . Appearing before Hayes on a Wednesday morning , the 28-year-old single mother pleaded for a break .\nJohnson had struggled for eight years to pay dozens of tickets that began with a citation for failing to show proof of insurance . She had insurance , she said . But when she was pulled over , she couldn ’ t find the card to prove it .\nEven a single ticket was a knockout blow on her minimum-wage waitress salary . In addition to fines , the court assessed a $ 155 fee to every ticket . Court records show that police often issued her multiple tickets for other infractions during every stop – a practice some residents call “ stacking . ”\nUnder state law , failing to pay even one ticket can result in the suspension of a driver ’ s license . Johnson ’ s decision to keep driving nonetheless – taking her children to school or to doctor visits , getting groceries , going to work – led to more tickets and deeper debt .\n“ I told Judge Hayes that I had lost my job and needed more time to pay , ” she recounted .\nBy Hayes ’ calculation , Johnson owed more than $ 12,000 in fines . He sentenced Johnson to 496 days in jail . Hayes arrived at that sentence by counting each day in jail as $ 25 toward the outstanding debt . A different judge later determined that Johnson actually owed half the amount calculated by Hayes , and that Hayes had incorrectly penalized her over fines she had already paid . To shave time off her sentence , Johnson washed police cars and performed other menial labor while jailed .\nHayes told ███ that he generally found pleas of poverty hard to believe . “ With my years of experience , I can tell when someone is being truthful with me , ” Hayes said . He called it “ gut instinct ” -- though he added , in a statement this week , that he also consulted “ each defendant 's criminal and traffic history as well as their history of warrants and failures to appear in court . ”\nOf course , the law demands more of a judge than a gut call . In a 1983 landmark decision , Bearden v. Georgia , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that state judges are obligated to hold a hearing to determine whether a defendant has “ willfully ” chosen not to pay a fine .\nAccording to the state ’ s judicial oversight commission , “ Judge Hayes did not make any inquiry into Ms. Johnson ’ s ability to pay , whether her non-payment was willful . ”\nFrom jail , “ I prayed to return to my daughters , ” Johnson said . “ I was sure that someone would realize that Hayes had made a mistake . ”\nShe said her worst day in jail was her youngest daughter ’ s 3rd birthday . From a jail telephone , she tried to sing “ Happy Birthday ” but slumped to the floor in grief .\n“ She was choking up and crying , ” said Johnson ’ s mother , Blanche , who was on the call . “ She was devastated to be away from her children so long . ”\nWhen Johnson was freed after 10 months in jail , she learned that strangers had abused her two older children . One is now a teenager ; the other is in middle school . “ My kids will pay a lifetime for what the court system did to me , ” Johnson said . “ My daughters get frantic when I leave the house . I know they ’ ve had nightmares that I ’ m going to disappear again . ”\nSix months after Johnson ’ s release , Hayes jailed another single Black mother . Angela McCullough , then 40 , had been pulled over driving home from Faulkner University , a local community college where she carried a 3.87 grade point average . As a mother of four children , including a disabled adult son , she had returned to college to pursue her dream of becoming a mental health counselor .\nPolice ticketed her for failing to turn on her headlights . After a background check , the officer arrested McCullough on a warrant for outstanding traffic tickets . She was later brought before Hayes .\n“ I can ’ t go to jail , ” McCullough recalled pleading with the judge . “ I ’ m a mother . I have a disabled son who needs me . ”\nHayes sentenced McCullough to 100 days in jail to pay off a court debt of $ 1,350 , court records show . Her adult son , diagnosed with schizophrenia , was held in an institution until her release .\nMcCullough said she cleaned jail cells in return for time off her sentence . One day , she recalled , she had to clean a blood-soaked cell where a female inmate had slit her wrists .\nShe was freed after 20 days , using the money she saved for tuition to pay off her tickets , she said .\nJail was the darkest chapter of her life , McCullough said , a place where “ the devil was trying to take my mind. ” Today , she has abandoned her pursuit of a degree . “ I don ’ t think I ’ ll ever be able to afford to go back . ”\nA clear sign that something was amiss in Montgomery courts came in November 2013 , when a federal lawsuit was filed alleging that city judges were unlawfully jailing the poor . A similar suit was filed in 2014 , and two more civil rights cases were filed in 2015 . Johnson and McCullough were plaintiffs .\nThe lawsuits detailed practices similar to those that helped fuel protests in Ferguson , Missouri , after a white police officer killed a Black teenager in 2014 . In a scathing report on the origins of the unrest , the U.S. Department of Justice exposed how Ferguson had systematically used traffic enforcement to raise revenue through excessive fines , a practice that fell disproportionately hard on Black residents .\n“ Montgomery is just like Ferguson , ” said Karen Jones , a community activist and founder of a local educational nonprofit . Jones has led recent protests in Montgomery in the wake of the killing of George Floyd , the Black man whose death under the knee of a cop in Minneapolis set off worldwide calls for racial justice .\nIn Montgomery , “ everybody knew that the police targeted Black residents . And I sat in Hayes ’ court and watched him squeeze poor people for more money , then toss them in jail where they had to work off debts with free labor to the city . ”\nIt was years before the flurry of civil rights lawsuits against Hayes and his fellow judges had much impact on the commission . The oversight agency opened its Hayes case in summer 2015 , nearly two years after plaintiffs ’ lawyers in the civil rights cases filed a complaint with the body . Hayes spent another year and a half on the bench before accepting the suspension .\nUnder its own rules , the commission could have filed a complaint and told its staff to investigate Hayes at any time . Commission director Garrett said she is prohibited by law from explaining why the commission didn ’ t investigate sooner . The investigation went slowly , Garrett said , because it involved reviewing thousands of pages of court records . The commission also was busy with other cases from 2015 to early 2017 , Garrett said , issuing charges against five judges , including Moore .\nA few months after Judge Hayes ’ suspension ended , his term as a municipal judge was set to expire . So , the Montgomery City Council took up the question of the judge ’ s future on March 6 , 2018 . On the agenda of its meeting : whether to reappoint Hayes to another four-year term .\nHayes wasn ’ t in the audience that night , but powerful supporters were . The city ’ s chief judge , Milton Westry , told the council that Hayes and his colleagues have changed how they handled cases involving indigent defendants , “ since we learned a better way of doing things. ” In the wake of the suits , Westry said , Hayes and his peers complied with reforms that required judges to make audio recordings of court hearings and notify lawyers when clients are jailed for failing to pay fines .\nAs part of a settlement in the civil case , the city judges agreed to implement changes for at least two years . Those reforms have since been abandoned , ███ found . Both measures were deemed too expensive , Hayes and city officials confirmed .\nResidents who addressed the council were incredulous that the city would consider reappointing Hayes . Jones , the community activist , reminded council members that Hayes had “ pleaded guilty to violating the very laws he was sworn to uphold . ”\nThe city council voted to rehire Hayes to a fifth consecutive term .\nMarquita Johnson said she can ’ t understand why a judge whose unlawful rulings changed the lives of hundreds has himself emerged virtually unscathed .\n“ Hiring Hayes back to the bench was a slap in the face to everyone , ” Johnson said . “ It was a message that we do n't matter . ”\nOn Thursday , Hayes will retire from the bench . In an earlier interview with ███ , he declined to discuss the Johnson case . Asked whether he regrets any of the sentences he has handed out , he paused .\n“ I think , maybe , I could have been more sympathetic at times , ” Hayes said . “ Sometimes you miss a few . ”\nAdditional reporting by Isabella Jibilian , Andrea Januta and Blake Morrison .

    "102": "The four US congresswomen attacked by US President Donald Trump in tweets widely called racist have dismissed his remarks as a distraction .\nRepresentatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , Ilhan Omar , Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib urged the US people `` not to take the bait '' at a news conference on Monday .\nMr Trump had suggested the four women - all US citizens - `` can leave '' .\nHe has defended his comments and denied allegations of racism .\nOn Tuesday , he kept up his Twitter attack on the women , accusing them of saying `` filthy and hate-laced things '' .\nHe also insisted : `` Those Tweets were NOT Racist . I do n't have a Racist bone in my body ! ''\nThe president did not explicitly name the women in his initial Twitter tirade on Sunday , but the context made a clear link to the four Democrat women , who are known as The Squad .\nHe sparked a furore after saying the women `` originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe '' and they should go home .\nThree of the women were born in the US and one , Ms Omar , was born in Somalia but came to the US as a child .\nFollowing the outcry , the four women told reporters they wanted to re-focus attention on to the president 's policies .\n`` This is simply a disruption and a distraction from the callous chaos and corrupt culture of this administration , all the way down , '' Ms Pressley said .\nBoth Ms Omar and Ms Tlaib repeated their calls for Mr Trump to be impeached .\nMs Pressley dismissed the president 's efforts `` to marginalise us and to silence us '' .\nShe added : `` Our squad includes any person committed to building a more equitable and just world . ''\nAll four women insisted that health care , gun violence and , in particular , detentions of migrants on the US border with Mexico should be in focus .\n`` The eyes of history are watching us , '' said Ms Omar said , decrying the `` mass deportation raids '' and `` human rights abuses at the border '' .\nMs Omar says Mr Trump 's `` blatantly racist attack '' on four women of colour was `` the agenda of white nationalists '' , adding that the president would like `` nothing more than to divide our country '' .\nMs Tlaib called it `` simply a continuation of his racist , xenophobic playbook '' .\n`` We remain focused on holding him accountable to the laws of this land , '' she said .\nPresident Trump doubled down at the White House , verbally attacking these congresswomen of colour , and he tripled down on Twitter later on .\nHe is using language that is well outside of the usual parameters of presidential discourse .\nThe fact that he is escalating the issue shows he seems to be enjoying it and , for him , it serves a political purpose . He sees it as revving up the base .\nHowever , he risks alienating the moderate Republicans - some of whom already failed to back him in last year 's mid-term elections .\nOn Friday , Ms Ocasio-Cortez , Ms Tlaib and Ms Pressley testified to a House committee about conditions in a migrant detention centre they had visited .\nDemocrats have widely criticised the Trump administration 's approach to border control , saying they are holding migrants in inhumane conditions .\nMr Trump insists the border is facing a crisis and has defended the actions of his border agents . His administration announced a new rule to take effect on 16 July , which denies asylum to anyone who crosses the southern border without having applied for protection in `` at least one third country '' on their way to the US .\nAfter their testimony , Mr Trump said conditions at the centre had had `` great reviews '' . He then posted his series of tweets about the women and Ms Omar , attacks he redoubled on Monday .\n`` If you are not happy , if you are complaining all the time , you can leave , '' he told a heated news conference outside the White House .\nAs the women spoke to reporters on Monday evening , he tweeted again .\n`` If you are not happy here , you can leave ! It is your choice , and your choice alone . This is about love for America , '' he wrote .\nDemocrats have roundly condemned the president , and many were quick to say it was a racist attack .\nHowever , top Republicans have been less outspoken . Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would answer questions Tuesday .\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said : `` I do n't find them racist , the president just went on and clarified his comments . '' He then changed the subject .\nSome , including Senator Lindsey Graham , turned the topic back on to the politics of the four women , who are seen to be progressive . He told Fox News they are communists and anti-America .\nUS Senator and former presidential candidate Mitt Romney called Mr Trump 's remarks `` destructive , demeaning , and disunifying '' . But when a reporter asked him if they were racist , he walked away .\nLower-ranking members of the Republican Party were , however , more direct .\nTim Scott , the only African-American Republican in the Senate , called the president 's words `` racially offensive '' . Republican Congressman Will Hurd , who is also African American , described the comments as `` racist and xenophobic '' .\nDemocratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has , meanwhile , announced a resolution in the House to condemn the attack . She has urged Republicans to back it .\nHer colleague Chuck Schumer said he would introduce a similar motion in the Senate . `` We 'll see how many Republicans sign on , '' he tweeted .\nThe leaders of several US allies have come out against the president .\nNew Zealand 's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said she `` completely and utterly '' disagreed with Mr Trump , while Canada 's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau similarly denounced the comments .\n`` That is not how we do things in Canada . A Canadian is a Canadian is a Canadian , '' he said at a press conference .\nBoth candidates for the British premiership condemned the attacks . Jeremy Hunt said he was `` utterly appalled '' by Mr Trump 's tweets , and Boris Johnson said `` you simply can not use that kind of language about sending people back to where they came from '' .\nPrime Minister Theresa May had earlier said the remarks were `` completely unacceptable '' . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

Dozens of immigrants lined up Tuesday at a major Mexico border crossing , waiting to learn how the Trump administration 's plans to end most asylum protections would affect their hopes of taking refuge in the United States . ( AP Photo/Gregory Bull )\nTIJUANA , Mexico ( AP ) — Hundreds of immigrants showed up at border crossings Tuesday in hopes of getting into the U.S. but faced the likelihood of being turned away under a new Trump administration asylum rule that upends long-standing protections for people fleeing violence and oppression in their homelands .\nThe policy went into effect Tuesday but drew two swift lawsuits from immigrant advocacy groups in federal courts , one in San Francisco and one in Washington , D.C .\n“ This is the Trump administration ’ s most extreme run at an asylum ban yet , ” said Lee Gelernt of the American Civil Liberties Union , an attorney on the San Francisco lawsuit . “ It clearly violates domestic and international law and can not stand . ”\nThe policy represents the most forceful attempt to date by President Donald Trump to slash the number of people seeking asylum in America . It comes at a time when Trump ’ s recent tweets telling four members of Congress to “ go back ” to other countries have set off an uproar .\nTrump did not mention the new practices Tuesday during a White House meeting .\nUnder the rules , migrants who pass through another country on their way to the U.S. will be ineligible for asylum . Most of the immigrants arriving at the border this year pass through Mexico — including Central Americans , Africans , Cubans and Haitians . That makes it all but impossible for them to get asylum . The rule also applies to children who have crossed the border alone .\nAt the crossing in Tijuana , 12 people whose numbers were first on a waiting list to enter through a San Diego border crossing were escorted behind a metal gate to a white van that left minutes later to turn them over to U.S. authorities .\nNdifor Gedeon , 27 , arrived in Tijuana nearly three months ago with the hope of seeking asylum in the U.S. after being jailed in Cameroon by a government that has been going after the African nation ’ s English-speaking minority .\nHe was rethinking those plans after hearing that he may not have a chance at getting asylum because of the new policy and if his case is denied he will be deported straight back to Cameroon .\n“ I feel sick , ” he said of the anxiety consuming him . “ If I am sent back to Cameroon , I ’ d lose my life . The situation is very horrible . ”\nHe speaks no Spanish and does not feel safe in Tijuana , which has one of the highest homicide rates in Mexico . Even so , he prefers Tijuana to returning to Cameroon .\nTrump has long complained that immigrants are taking advantage of the nation ’ s asylum system to get into the country , and his administration has taken several steps to limit their options .\nMany of the measures have been rejected by the courts , but one notable exception is a policy that requires certain asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their immigration court cases get resolved . About 20,000 have been sent back to Mexico , and thousands more are on wait lists just to get to the front of the line to get an asylum interview .\nAsylum seekers must also pass an initial screening called a “ credible fear ” interview , a hurdle that a vast majority clear . Under the new policy , they would fail the test unless they sought asylum in at least one country they traveled through and were denied . They would be placed in fast-track deportation proceedings and flown to their home countries at U.S. expense .\nDespite the policies , record numbers of immigrant families have been crossing the border this year , overwhelming border facilities and authorities . Five immigrant children have died since late last year after being detained by the government , and children have been found in squalid and overcrowded border facilities .\nThe crisis has only served to intensify immigration as a campaign issue as Trump looks to rally his base like he did in 2016 with his vow to build a wall on the border .\nAt a crossing in Ciudad Juarez , Mexico , 10 Cuban asylum seekers were called by Mexican officials and led across the Paso Del Norte Bridge to El Paso , where they were handed over to Customs and Border Protection officers . They were taken to a room where their possessions were searched , laid out on a table and bagged .\nThe immigrants will still go through the normal first steps of requesting asylum , but will face a dramatically higher bar to be allowed in the country .\nLawyers who represent Cuban migrants say that they are not deportable because Cuba will not accept them .\n“ I ’ d rather be in prison the rest of my life than go back to Cuba , ” said Dileber Urrista Sanchez , who had hoped his number would be called Tuesday , but he was further down the list .\nSanchez , 35 , has waited with his wife in Juarez for the past two months , renting a room with money his mother sends him from Las Vegas .\nHe said his mother left Cuba years ago because she was part of an opposition party . In retaliation , he said , the government took away his job as a chauffeur , and he and his wife had been imprisoned for days at a time for being “ untrustworthy . ”\nHe criticized the Trump administration ’ s new policy , pointing out that the first country he was able to reach after leaving Cuba was Nicaragua .\n“ How are we going to apply for asylum in Nicaragua when it ’ s just as communist ? ” he said .\nDerek Mbi of Cameroon was among nearly 50 migrants who gathered in Tijuana . He arrived there about a month ago , and more than 8,100 people were ahead of him on the waiting list .\nProcessing new arrivals has ground to a virtual halt in recent days , down from an average of about 40 names a day .\nMbi , 29 , joined a wave of Cameroonians who fled fierce government oppression against their country ’ s English-speaking minority by flying to Ecuador , which does not require a visa . From there , he traveled for months by bus and on foot through seven other countries to reach Tijuana .\nMbi learned about the new policy but mistakenly believed that it applied only to Central and South Americans . He hopes to settle with a friend in Texas .\nFor now , he is sharing a one-bedroom apartment with 13 Cameroonians in Tijuana and scraping by with odd jobs , like peeling tomatoes at open-air markets . He said many companies refused to hire him because his short-term transit permit in Mexico does not allow him to work . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

( AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall )\nAs the Trump administration pushes full steam ahead to force schools to resume in-person education , public health experts warn that a one-size-fits-all reopening could drive infection and death rates even higher .\nThey ’ re urging a more cautious approach , which many local governments and school districts are already pursuing .\nBut U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos doubled down on President Donald Trump ’ s insistence that kids can safely return to the classroom .\n“ There ’ s nothing in the data that suggests that kids being in school is in any way dangerous , ” she told Chris Wallace on “ Fox News Sunday . ”\nStill , health experts say there are too many uncertainties and variables for back-to-school to be back-to-normal .\nWhere is the virus spreading rapidly ? Do students live with aged grandparents ? Do teachers have high-risk health conditions that would make online teaching safest ? Do infected children easily spread COVID-19 to each other and to adults ?\nRegarding the latter , some evidence suggests they don ’ t , but a big government study aims to find better proof . Results won ’ t be available before the fall , and some schools are slated to reopen in just a few weeks .\n“ These are complicated issues . You can ’ t just charge straight ahead , ” Dr. Tom Frieden , former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said Wednesday during an online briefing .\nChildren infected with coronavirus are more likely than adults to have mild illnesses , but their risk for severe disease and death isn ’ t zero . While a virus-linked inflammatory condition is uncommon , most children who develop it require intensive care , and a few have died . Doctors don ’ t know which children are at risk .\n“ The single most important thing we can do to keep our schools safe has nothing to do with what happens in school . It ’ s how well we control COVID-19 in the community , ” Frieden said . “ Right now there are places around the country where the virus is spreading explosively and it would be difficult if not impossible to operate schools safely until the virus is under better control . ”\nZahrah Wattier teaches high school in Galveston , Texas , where cases and deaths have been spiking . Until the state recently said schools must reopen to in-person classes , her district had been weighing options many others are considering , including full-time online teaching or a hybrid mix .\nWattier ’ s school has mostly Hispanic and Black students , many from low-income families ; almost 70 % qualify for free or reduced-cost lunches and many have parents who work in “ essential ” jobs that increase potential exposure to the virus . Online education was hard for many with limited internet access , and Wattier knows in-person classes can help even the playing field .\n“ My school has over 2,000 students . That ’ s over 2,000 exposures in a day , ” said Wattier , whose parents live with the family and are both high-risk . “ It ’ s a lot to think about . It ’ s my job . It ’ s something I choose to do , it ’ s something I love . Now it comes at a really high risk . ”\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics , whose guidance the Trump administration has cited to support its demands , says the goal is for all students to be physically present in school . But , it adds , districts must be flexible , consult with health authorities and be ready to pivot as virus activity waxes and wanes .\n“ It is not that the American Academy of Pediatrics thinks this is a done deal because we have put out guidance , ” said Dr. Nathaniel Beers , a member of the academy ’ s school health council . “ But what we do know is that we need to have a more realistic dialogue about the implications of virtual learning on the future of children . We have left whole swaths of society behind , whether it ’ s because they have limited access to a computer , or broadband internet , ” or because of other challenges that online education can ’ t address .\nDeVos said local school officials are smart enough to know when conditions are not right .\n“ There ’ s going to be the exception to the rule , but the rule should be that kids go back to school this fall , ” she told CNN ’ s “ State of the Union . ”\n“ And where there are little flare-ups or hot spots , that can be dealt with on a school by school or a case by case basis . ”\nFollowing CDC and academy guidelines would mean big changes for most schools . Mask-wearing would be strongly encouraged for adult staff and students except the youngest . Desks would be distanced at least 3 feet apart ; the CDC recommends 6 feet . Both suggest limiting adults allowed in schools , including parents , and canceling group activities like choir and assemblies . Staggered arrival and dismissal times , outdoor classes , and keeping kids in the same classroom all day are other options .\nPresident Trump has threatened federal funding cuts for districts that don ’ t fully reopen .\nDeVos defended that stance , saying , “ American investment in education is a promise to students and their families . ”\n“ If schools aren ’ t going to reopen and not fulfill that promise , they shouldn ’ t get the funds , and give it to the families to decide to go to a school that is going to meet that promise , ” she said on “ Fox News Sunday . ”\nU.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called DeVos ’ comments “ malfeasance and dereliction of duty . ”\n“ They ’ re messing , the president and his administration are messing with the health of our children , ” the California Democrat told CNN ’ s “ State of the Union . ”\nWhile most funding typically comes from state and local sources , experts say schools will need more federal funding , not less , to reopen safely . Masks , extra cleaning supplies or janitors , additional classroom space , and mental health support for students and staff traumatized by the pandemic are among potential costs . And with more parents out of work , more children will qualify for federally funded school lunches .\nLynn Morales , 49 , teaches 8th grade English at a high-poverty public school in Bloomington , Minnesota , that is considering several options including in-person classes ; a final decision is expected Aug. 1 .\nSome colleagues are considering not returning to the classroom because their children ’ s day care centers aren ’ t reopening . Some say they won ’ t come back until there ’ s a vaccine .\n“ I am concerned and it ’ s because of the age group , ” Morales said . ’ ’ Middle school students ... are lovely and I love them , but they touch , they get close , they roughhouse . It is their nature . They ’ re 13 years old . They are defiant . ”\n“ If masks are required and a kid isn ’ t wearing a mask , is my job description going to be to chase down this kid and insist they wear a mask ? And what if they don ’ t ? ”\nDr. Emily Landon , a University of Chicago infectious disease specialist , is helping the university and a campus preK-12 school decide how to reopen safely .\n“ Things are evolving from , ‘ We can ’ t do it unless it ’ s perfectly safe ’ to more of a harm reduction model , with the caveat that you can always step back ” if virus activity flares , Landon said .\nSingle-occupancy dorms , outdoor classes , socially distanced classrooms and mask-wearing by students and faculty are on tap for the university . Face coverings will be required at the school too . Policies may change depending on virus activity .\nShe dismisses complaints from some parents who say masks are a loss of personal freedom .\n“ It ’ s not harmful for your child , ” she said . “ If you see wearing masks as a loss of personal freedom , then you have to think the same of pants . ”\nDr. Tina Hartert of Vanderbilt University is leading a National Institutes of Health-funded study to determine what role children play in transmitting COVID-19 . Almost 2,000 families are enrolled and self-test every two weeks . The idea is to find infected children without symptoms and see how easily disease spreads within families . Results may come by year ’ s end .\n“ If we don ’ t see significant transmission within households , that would be very reassuring , ” Hartert said .\nShe noted that in other countries where schools have reopened , evidence suggests no widespread transmission from children .\nIn France , public schools reopened briefly before a summer break , with no sign of widespread virus transmission . Masks were only required for upper grades , but students stayed in the same classroom all day . A better test will be when the new school year starts Sept. 1 .\nIn Norway , schools closed in March for several weeks . Nursery schools reopened first , then other grades . Children were put in smaller groups that stay together all day . Masks aren ’ t required . There have been only a few virus cases , said Dr. Margrethe Greve-Isdahl of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health , but she noted virus activity is much lower than in the U.S .\nKati Spaniak , a realtor in Northbrook , Illinois , says her five teenage daughters have struggled to cope with pandemic fears , school closures and deficits of online learning . She strongly supports getting kids back in the classroom , and all her girls will return to some form of that in the fall .\nIt ’ s been hard for her high school senior , Kylie Ciesla . Prom , graduation and other senior rituals were canceled , and there were no good-byes . “ Just to get ripped away from everything I ’ ve worked for 12 years , it ’ s really hard , ” Kylie said .\nAt college , classes will be in person , masks mandated and a COVID-19 test required before she can move into her dorm . Kylie isn ’ t sure all that is needed .\n“ I hate that this thing has become so political . I just want the science .

Two days earlier , Defense Secretary Mark Esper indicated that he was open to a broad discussion of such changes .\n“ These Monumental and very Powerful Bases have become part of a Great American Heritage , a history of Winning , Victory , and Freedom , ” Trump wrote . “ The United States of America trained and deployed our HEROES on these Hallowed Grounds , and won two World Wars . Therefore , my Administration will not even consider the renaming of these Magnificent and Fabled Military Installations . ”\nName changes have not been proposed by the Army or the Pentagon , but on Monday , Esper and Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy indicated in response to questions from reporters that they were “ open to a bipartisan discussion ” of renaming bases such as Fort Bragg in North Carolina and Fort Benning in Georgia .\nSupporters of disassociating military bases from Confederate Army officers argue that they represent the racism and divisiveness of the Civil War era and glorify men who fought against the United States .\nTo amplify Trump ’ s view , his press secretary , Kayleigh McEnany , read his tweets to reporters in the White House briefing room . She said he is “ fervently ” opposed to changing the base names and believes that doing so would amount to “ complete disrespect ” for soldiers who trained there over the years .\n... history of Winning , Victory , and Freedom . The United States of America trained and deployed our HEROES on these Hallowed Grounds , and won two World Wars . Therefore , my Administration will not even consider the renaming of these Magnificent and Fabled Military Installations ... — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) June 10 , 2020\nThe possibility of renaming the bases , McEnany said , is “ an absolute non-starter ” for Trump .\nIf Congress were to pass legislation requiring name changes , he would not sign it , she said .\nThe U.S. military recently began rethinking its traditional connection to Confederate Army symbols , including the Army base names , mindful of their divisiveness at a time the nation is wrestling with questions of race after the death of George Floyd in police hands . The Navy and the Marine Corps are now banning public displays of the Confederate Army battle flag on their installations , casting their decision as necessary to preserve cohesion within the ranks .\nTen major Army installations are named for Confederate Army officers , mostly senior generals , including Robert E. Lee . Among the 10 is Fort Benning , the namesake of Confederate Army Gen. Henry L. Benning , who was a leader of Georgia ’ s secessionist movement and an advocate of preserving slavery . Others are in Virginia , North Carolina , Alabama , Texas and Louisiana . The naming was done mostly after World War I and in the 1940s , in some cases as gestures of conciliation to the South .\nFew voices in the military are openly defending the link to Confederate symbols , but some of the bases named for Confederate officers are legendary in their own right . Fort Bragg , for example , is home to some of the Army ’ s most elite forces . Any decision to change the name at Bragg or other bases likely would involve consulting with officials from the affected states and localities .\nPaul Eaton , a retired two-star Army general and a former commanding general of Fort Benning , said Trump ’ s statements go against ideals the Army stands for .\n“ Today , Donald Trump made it official . Rather than move this nation further away from institutionalized racism , he believes we should cling to it and its heritage , by keeping the names of racist traitors on the gates of our military bases , ” Eaton said .\nPeter Mansoor , a retired Army colonel and veteran of the Iraq war , said in an email exchange that renaming these bases is long overdue .\n“ Most serving soldiers know little about the history behind the Confederate leaders for whom these bases are named , or the political deals that caused them to be honored in this fashion , ” he said . “ There might be some pushback from a small segment of soldiers from the South , but this is what we like to call a ‘ teachable moment. ’ Now is the time to finally bring about a change that will speak volumes as to what the U.S. Army stands for . ”\nDavid Petraeus , a retired four-star Army general , said the renaming move , which he supports , amounts to a “ war of memory , ” and that before deciding to rename bases like Fort Bragg , where he served with the 82nd Airborne Division , the Army must be ready to follow its own procedures for such change .\n“ The irony of training at bases named for those who took up arms against the United States , and for the right to enslave others , is inescapable to anyone paying attention , ” Petraeus wrote in an essay published Tuesday by The Atlantic . “ Now , belatedly , is the moment for us to pay such attention . ”\nFort Bragg was named for Braxton Bragg , a native North Carolinian and Confederate general with a reputation for bravery and mediocre leadership . His forces were defeated at the Battle of Chattanooga in November 1863 . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

Trump said Sunday , March 15 , 2020 , that he is considering a full pardon for Flynn , who had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about dealings with Russia ’ s ambassador before Trump took office . ( AP Photo/Patrick Semansky , File )\nWASHINGTON ( AP ) — President Donald Trump voiced strong support Thursday for his former national security adviser Michael Flynn , raising speculation that a pardon may be coming after Flynn ’ s lawyers disclosed internal FBI documents they claim show the FBI tried to “ intentionally frame ” him .\nTrump said he believes Flynn should now be cleared in court , but if that doesn ’ t happen , he as president has “ a different type of power . ”\n“ It looks to me like Michael Flynn would be exonerated based on everything I see , ” Trump told reporters Thursday . “ I ’ m not the judge , but I have a different type of power . But I don ’ t know that anybody would have to use that power . I think he ’ s exonerated . ”\nTrump has long said he is considering pardoning Flynn , who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian ambassador to the United States . The president spent Wednesday night and Thursday morning retweeting supportive statements of Flynn and condemned the FBI ’ s investigation into his onetime adviser\n“ They came at him with 15 buses and he ’ s standing in the middle of the highway . What they did to this man , ” Trump said at an earlier event at the White House , without specifying what he meant . “ They tormented him . They destroyed him . But he ’ s going to come back . ”\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called into Fox News Channel to react to the release of the FBI documents , saying , “ If true , it is extremely troubling . ”\n“ If all this proves to be true , you will have , certainly , a major , major error on the part of top leadership at the FBI , which could well warrant additional charges against them , ” he said .\nLawyers for Flynn over the last two days released a series of internal correspondence obtained through a Justice Department review of the handling of the case . They contend the documents bolster their allegations that Flynn was set up to lie when he was questioned at the White House three years ago , and show that agents were prepared to drop an investigation into him just weeks before they set out to question him .\nStill , the documents don ’ t directly address the central allegation in the case — that Flynn lied to the FBI . It ’ s also unclear how much significance they will carry with the judge , who has already publicly scolded Flynn and rejected many defense allegations of prosecutorial misconduct . The judge , Emmet Sullivan , has not ruled on Flynn ’ s request to withdraw his guilty plea .\nAmong the documents is a redacted internal memo from Jan. 4 , 2017 , saying the FBI was closing out its investigation into whether a subject with the code name of Crossfire Razor was an agent of a foreign power or acting under the direction of Russia . The subject is described as a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser who traveled to Russia in 2015 .\nFlynn ’ s attorney Sidney Powell confirmed Thursday that Crossfire Razor was Flynn .\nBut about two weeks later , according to the documents , case agent Peter Strzok told a colleague not to close the case and to “ pls keep it open for now. ” In communication with FBI lawyer Lisa Page , who expressed surprise the case was still open , Strzok responded , “ Yeah , our utter incompetence actually helps us . ”\nStrzok and Page have attracted Trump ’ s derision for exchanging derogatory texts about him during the 2016 campaign . Both have since left the FBI .\nBy later in the month , the FBI determined they wanted to interview Flynn about conversations he had during the presidential transition period with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in which the men discussed sanctions recently imposed on Russia over election interference .\nAgents questioned Flynn at the White House on Jan. 24 , 2017 , when the FBI says he lied about the Kislyak conversations . He later acknowledged misleading federal agents and , at his sentencing hearing a year later , did not contest the way he was interviewed .\nBut Flynn ’ s attorneys point to the newly disclosed documents to suggest the FBI had no basis to question Flynn and had already been prepared to close an investigation into him .\n“ The revelations of corruption by the FBI to intentionally frame Gen Flynn for crimes the FBI manufactured piles on with each new production of documents , ” Powell wrote in a statement .\nA federal prosecutor from Missouri is reviewing the Justice Department ’ s handling of the case at the direction of Attorney General William Barr . The department said the documents were provided as part of that review .\nProsecutors haven ’ t responded to the defense team ’ s disclosures , though they have previously denied accusations of misconduct . Sullivan , too , has rejected many of the defense arguments in the past .\nEven so , Flynn — who was among the first of the president ’ s aides charged in special counsel Robert Mueller ’ s investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia — has emerged as something of a cause celebre for supporters of the president . They have rallied around the retired Army lieutenant general and seized on the findings of a critical watchdog report on the Russia investigation to try to cast doubt on the entire probe .\nTrump has not been shy about using his pardon power to help political allies and those he believes have been wronged by an out-of-control justice system . He has also expressed a desire to intervene in the case of another ally : longtime political adviser Roger Stone .\nOther documents released by Flynn ’ s lawyers include FBI emails and handwritten notes showing officials grappling with how best to approach Flynn , how much information to provide him during the interview and what to do if he made a false statement .\nOne page of handwritten notes from an FBI official , dated the day of the interview , appears to recap an internal debate about how to proceed .\n“ What ’ s our goal ? Truth/admission or to get him to lie , so we can prosecute him or get him fired ? ” the notes say .\nThe notes also say , “ If we ’ re seen as playing games , WH will be furious . Protect our institution by not playing games . ”\nFlynn pleaded guilty in December 2017 and went on to provide such extensive cooperation that prosecutors said he was entitled to probation instead of prison .\nBut his sentencing hearing was abruptly postponed after Flynn , following a stern rebuke from Sullivan that raised the prospect of a prison term , asked to be able to continue cooperating and earn credit toward a more lenient sentence .\nSince then , Flynn has hired new attorneys , including Powell , a conservative commentator and outspoken critic of Mueller ’ s investigation , who have taken a more adversarial stance on his behalf . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

Jeff Sessions never took control of the justice department and it 's a sort of an incredible thing .

Mr Sessions is just as determined as Mr Trump is - and also refuses to back down . Only Mr Sessions is guided by a set of bedrock conservative principles , rather than the egotism and quicksilver impulses that fuel Mr Trump 's tweets and , increasingly , his TV interviews .\nFor these reasons Mr Sessions is a formidable enemy , and the battle between these two men could be long .\nMr Sessions made his statement during a fraught week for the White House .\nTwo days ago , in the most dramatic developments yet linked to the Russia inquiry , former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort was found guilty of tax and bank fraud and Mr Trump 's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to crimes including tax evasion , bank fraud and campaign finance violations .\nUnder oath , Cohen said he had been directed by Mr Trump to organise secret payments to silence two women who claimed they had affairs with the then Republican presidential candidate , violating campaign finance laws . Mr Trump has denied he broke the law .\nThe sense that the president 's legal troubles are growing were not dampened by Thursday 's US media reports that prosecutors in the Cohen case had granted immunity from prosecution to the chairman of the company that publishes the National Enquirer , David Pecker , a friend of Mr Trump .\nIn the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election , Playboy model Karen McDougal sold her story of her alleged affair with Mr Trump to the Enquirer .\nThe contract she signed gave the tabloid exclusive story rights and banned her from talking publicly about the alleged affair .

For the first time in his presidency , Trump had a Democrat seated behind him in the House chamber , Speaker Nancy Pelosi , and spoke to a Congress where Democrats share power with Republicans .\nBeyond Capitol Hill , the field of Democrats seeking to challenge Trump for the presidency is growing by the week .\nThe speech suggested that Trump , while talking up such lofty bipartisan goals such as combating HIV and childhood cancer , was signaling to his most passionate supporters that he was not about to compromise on the issues that matter most to them .\n“ While there were many unifying moments , the president took time to appeal to his base over issues that split the parties such as investigations , immigration and abortion , ” said Ron Bonjean , a longtime Republican strategist in Washington .\n“ Nothing has changed after tonight ’ s delivery by Trump because both sides are simply too dug in to allow any sort of major compromise legislation to occur , ” Bonjean said .\nFresh off a month-long partial government shutdown that damaged him politically , Trump showed no inclination he would back off his demand for more than $ 5 billion for a barrier along the U.S border with Mexico — and in fact used a large portion of the speech to make his case for the wall to the American people .\nIn doing so , Trump employed much of same rhetoric he used during last year ’ s congressional elections , warning of an “ onslaught ” of migrants from Central America , labeling the border “ lawless ” and declaring that “ countless ” Americans had been murdered by illegal immigrants .\nFor a reminder of how his party fared in those midterm elections , Trump only had to look at the sea of white outfits worn by Democratic women in attendance on the House floor . They chanted “ USA ! USA ! ” when Trump recognized their achievement .\nRegardless , Trump delivered a stark warning to Democrats such as Pelosi who have said they will push to hold his administration accountable : Back off , or I won ’ t work with you .\n“ If there is going to be peace and legislation , there can not be war and investigation , ” Trump said . “ It just doesn ’ t work that way . ”\nAnd in talking about the vibrant American economy , Trump implied he would be quick to blame Democrats for any slowdown .\nTrump also re-stoked America ’ s culture wars , spending a portion of the speech blasting abortion-rights legislation in New York and Virginia , a move that will endear him to evangelical voters .\n“ There was very little difference between this speech and what you ’ d hear at one of his campaign rallies , ” said Doug Thornell , a longtime Democratic congressional aide .\n“ To many people this speech will be remembered for his continued obsession with the wall , the demonization of immigrants , and his bizarre attack on congressional investigations . Truly stunning . ”\nBut Alex Conant , a former top aide to Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio , said that Trump succeeded in showing that he was open to working with Democrats on issues such as prescription drug prices .\n“ After a tough couple of weeks , this was the reset that Trump needed , ” Conant said . “ He laid out a popular agenda and framed the big political issues of the day in the most favorable way possible . ”\nThere are clear signs that the showdown over the border wall has dinged the president : The most recent ███/Ipsos tracking poll had Trump ’ s approval rating at a shade over 39 percent , the lowest it has been since early last October .\nThe number of Americas who disapprove of Trump ’ s job performance stood at more than 56 percent .\nWith Trump ’ s re-election campaign set to begin in earnest , the president must also await the final determination of Special Counsel Robert Mueller , who is investigating ties between Trump ’ s campaign team and Russian officials as well as possible obstruction of justice .\nA year ago , Trump made a similar plea for bread-breaking with Democrats , only to have the year swallowed up by scorched-earth congressional elections , a divisive fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh , and finally the 35-day government shutdown .\nAll the while , Trump regularly blasted Democrats on his Twitter feed as unhelpful , obstructionist and unpatriotic .\n“ There is no reason to think he wants unity . He thrives on disunity , ” said John Geer , an expert on public opinion at Vanderbilt University . “ The president may call for working together , but past behavior suggests otherwise . ” \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

Joe Biden is the latest prominent politician to navigate this tricky terrain . ( AP Photo/Nick Wass , File )\nWASHINGTON ( AP ) — Hunter Biden , acknowledging that his family name created business opportunities , rejected assertions by President Donald Trump that he did anything wrong by engaging in foreign work in Ukraine and China .\nBut Biden , the son of former Vice President Joe Biden , conceded that he failed to take into account potential implications for his father ’ s political career .\n“ Did I make a mistake ? Maybe in the grand scheme of things , ” Hunter Biden said in an ABC News interview that aired on Tuesday . “ But did I make a mistake based on some ethical lapse ? Absolutely not . ”\nJoe Biden is a front-runner in the 2020 Democratic presidential contest , and the interview with his son aired hours before the fourth Democratic presidential debate .\nHunter Biden said he did not discuss his foreign business dealings with his father . He served on the board of an energy company in Ukraine , a fact he said his father learned from press reports .\nThe younger Biden was a lawyer at a top Washington law firm with expertise in corporate governance . But he acknowledged on Tuesday that he probably would not have been asked to serve on the board if not for his name .\n“ I don ’ t think there ’ s a lot of things that would have happened in my life if my last name wasn ’ t Biden , ” he said .\nTrump and his Republican allies have targeted Hunter Biden for his work in Ukraine and China , making baseless claims of corruption .\nTrump ’ s July 25 phone call pressuring Ukraine ’ s leader to investigate the Bidens is the focus of a whistleblower complaint that triggered the formal House impeachment inquiry into Trump . Trump has denied wrongdoing .\nHours after Hunter Biden ’ s interview aired , Trump said in a tweet that the former vice president ’ s son was “ really bad ” in the ABC interview and that “ Sleepy Joe has real problems . ”\nHunter Biden recently said he would step down from the board of directors of a Chinese-backed private equity firm because his service had become a “ distraction . ”\n“ That ’ s why I have committed that I won ’ t serve on any board or work on any foreign entities when Dad becomes president , ” he said . “ That ’ s the rule I ’ m going to adhere to . ”\nJoe Biden said on Sunday that if he ’ s elected : “ No one in my family will have an office in the White House , will sit in meetings as if they ’ re a Cabinet member , will in fact have any business relationships with anyone that relates to a foreign corporation or foreign country . ”\nOn Tuesday , Biden ’ s deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said in a statement “ Hunter was forceful and spoke with conviction , ” and after “ an unprecedented smear campaign by the president of the United States , who is engulfed in a scandal of his own making . ”\nIn 2014 , then Vice President Joe Biden was at the forefront of American diplomatic efforts to support Ukraine ’ s fragile democratic government as it sought to fend off Russian aggression and root out corruption . President Barack Obama ’ s White House said there was no conflict with Hunter Biden ’ s work for a Ukrainian gas company because the younger Biden was a private citizen .\nBesides Trump ’ s July 25 phone call to Ukraine ’ s leader pressing for investigations , Rudy Giuliani , Trump ’ s personal lawyer , began reaching out to Ukraine ’ s president and his aides to press for a government investigation into the company , Burisma , and Hunter Biden ’ s role .\nHunter Biden blamed his father ’ s political opponents , including Trump , for spreading a “ ridiculous conspiracy theory . ”\n“ I gave a hook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father . That ’ s where I made the mistake , ” he said . “ So I take full responsibility for that . Did I do anything improper ? No , not in any way . Not in any way whatsoever . ”\nHe added : “ What I regret is not taking into account that there would be a Rudy Giuliani and a president of the United States that would be listening to this ridiculous conspiracy idea . ”\n“ Being the subject of Donald Trump ’ s ire is a feather in my cap , ” he said . “ It ’ s not something that I go to bed nervous about at night at all . The reason I ’ m able to do that is because I am absolutely enveloped in love of my family . ”\nIn recent weeks , Trump has relentlessly mocked Hunter Biden , to the point that his presidential campaign began selling shirts that say , “ Where ’ s Hunter ? ” highlighting that the former vice president ’ s son had been out of the public spotlight for weeks . At a recent political rally , Trump noted that Hunter Biden had been thrown out of the Navy .\nHunter Biden was discharged from the Navy Reserve in 2014 after failing a drug test and has struggled with alcohol and drug abuse . He told ABC News that , “ like every single person that I ’ ve ever known , I have fallen and I ’ ve gotten up . ”\n“ I ’ ve done esteemable things and things that are — have been in my life that I regret . Every single one of those things has brought me exactly to where I am right now , which is probably the best place I ’ ve ever been in my life .

    "116": "WASHINGTON ( ███ ) - President Donald Trump began talks with Republican senators on Tuesday to try to build consensus for proposed tax cuts in a meeting that was overshadowed by an exchange of insults between the president and one of the lawmakers .\nTrump has asked his fellow Republicans who control Congress to pass a package of tax cuts , including a deep reduction in the corporate income tax , by year ’ s end .\nBut hours before he was to promote the tax plan at a weekly lunch for Republican senators on Capitol Hill , Trump engaged in a distracting tussle with one of those lawmakers : Bob Corker , a leading fiscal hawk and the head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .\n“ Bob Corker , who ... couldn ’ t get elected dog catcher in Tennessee , is now fighting Tax Cuts , ” Trump wrote on Twitter , later adding that the senator is “ incompetent . ”\nTrump arrived at the Capitol building with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for the lunch and gave a thumbs up to waiting reporters .\nA protester threw a handful of small Russian flags toward Trump and shouted comments about accusations of collusion between his presidential campaign and Moscow . Both Trump and Russia deny colluding but a special counsel appointed by the U.S. Justice Department and congressional committees are looking into the matter .\nAlienating any members of his own party could be costly for Trump ’ s legislative initiatives in the Senate because Republicans control the chamber by just a slim 52-48 margin .\nCorker warned Trump in television interviews against interfering in congressional efforts to finalize the legislation to cut taxes and called the president ’ s visit with Senate Republicans “ a photo op . ”\n“ Hopefully , the White House will step aside and let that occur in a normal process , ” the Tennessee Republican told NBC ’ s “ Today ” program . “ That ’ s the best way for us to have success . ”\nCorker also described Trump in a Twitter post as “ an utterly untruthful president , ” and in television interviews accused Trump of debasing the United States .\nHouse of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan urged reporters to ignore the Trump-Corker spat and concentrate on the tax plan .\n“ Put this Twitter dispute aside . The fact is we have an historic chance of fixing this tax code , ” Ryan said .\nRyan added that he knows Corker well and predicted that the senator is “ going to vote for tax reform . ”\nU.S. President Donald Trump walks with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-KY ) as he arrives for the Republican policy luncheon on Capitol Hill in Washington , U.S. , October 24 , 2017 . ███/Joshua Roberts\nRyan said he wants the House to pass the Republican tax cut bill by the Nov. 23 U.S. Thanksgiving holiday , echoing Trump ’ s call to speed up the party ’ s efforts to get the measure approved before year ’ s end .\nCNBC reported that Republicans plan to release their tax bill on Nov. 1 after an expected House vote on Thursday on a Senate-approved budget plan .\nHouse leaders are eager to get a tax bill voted on before the Dec. 8 deadline for a possible government shutdown comes into view , as it is likely to distract from the tax overhaul , financial firm Cowen and Co. said in a research note .\n“ The Senate time-frame on taxes remains much more of a mystery with a Senate Finance draft likely in the late November/early December time frame , ” Cowen analyst Chris Krueger said .\nSecuring congressional passage of his tax plan is critically important to Trump , who has yet to get major legislation through Congress since taking office in January , including a healthcare overhaul he promised as a candidate last year . Tax cuts were another of Trump ’ s campaign pledges .\nThe White House argues that tax cuts are needed to boost economic growth and create jobs , but has shown sensitivity in recent weeks to arguments that it is endangering America ’ s long-term fiscal health .\nTrump said he believed the tax overhaul would help bring in $ 4 trillion in foreign profits from U.S. companies . “ It ’ s going to bring back , I would say , $ 4 trillion back into this country , ” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office . “ Nobody even knows the amount , ” Trump said .\nMarket analysts estimate that about $ 2.6 trillion in profits is being held offshore by U.S. multinationals to avoid the current 35 percent U.S. corporate income tax . Trump ’ s tax plan would require multinationals to bring in , or repatriate , those profits at a sharply reduced tax rate payable over several years .\nOne of the key elements of the proposal is to slash the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent . While the broad parameters of the tax proposal have been made public , detailed legislation has not yet been unveiled .\nDemocrats have painted Trump ’ s plan , with its $ 6 trillion in tax cuts , as a gift to the rich and corporate America that would balloon the federal deficit .\nTrump promised on Monday to protect a popular retirement program as Republican lawmakers seek ways to pay for the proposed cuts . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

( AP Photo/Gerald Herbert , File )\nDETROIT ( AP ) — African Americans are disproportionately likely to say a family member or close friend has died of COVID-19 or respiratory illness since March , according to a series of surveys conducted since April that lays bare how black Americans have borne the brunt of the pandemic .\nEleven percent of African Americans say they were close with someone who has died from the coronavirus , compared with 5 % of Americans overall and 4 % of white Americans .\nThe findings are based on data from three COVID Impact surveys conducted between April and June by NORC at the University of Chicago for the Data Foundation about the pandemic ’ s effect on the physical , mental and social health of Americans .\nWhile recent surveys conducted by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research have found that black Americans are especially likely to know someone who had the virus , the new data from the COVID Impact research further details the toll the pandemic has taken on black Americans .\nPre-existing conditions and limited access to health care have been identified as reasons black Americans have been particularly susceptible to the virus . Experts and medical professionals say the longstanding effects of structural racism and generational trauma exacted upon black Americans in the centuries following slavery also can not be ignored .\n“ The health inequities that we ’ re seeing here are nothing new , because we ’ re starting in a place where during slavery , we had black women who were enslaved and were being experimented on by white male physicians , ” said New York-based Dr. Uché Blackstock , a former associate professor at the NYU School of Medicine and the founder of Advancing Health Equity . “ So our healthcare system is founded on racism , and our communities have been essentially made sick by racism . We carry the highest disease burden in almost every parameter . We were already in a crisis . ”\nThe COVID Impact surveys show the racial gap is equally striking in some cities and states hit especially hard by the virus . In Louisiana , 16 % of black adults , compared with 6 % of white adults , are close with someone who has died , according to the surveys . Black people represent about 33 % of the state ’ s population but account for 53 % of the state ’ s nearly 3,000 COVID-19 deaths , according to data from the state ’ s health department .\nThe differences are equally stark in several metropolitan areas : Among black adults in Atlanta , 14 % have a family member or close friend who has died , compared with 4 % of white adults . The comparison is 12 % vs. 4 % in Baltimore , 15 % vs. 2 % in Birmingham , Alabama , and 12 % vs. 4 % in Chicago .\nTwenty-six percent of nonwhite New Yorkers say a family member or close friend has died from COVID-19 , compared with just 10 % of white adults in New York City .\nMeanwhile , an ███ analysis of data from state and local health departments nationwide found that more than a quarter of all COVID-related deaths nationwide have been black victims — nearly double the share of the black population in the areas sampled . The data , from early June , included nearly 87,000 deaths in which the dead person ’ s race was known in 38 states and Washington , D.C .\nIn a number of states , the disparity was even more outsized — for instance , in Michigan , black deaths per 100,000 black residents were four times the rate of white deaths per 100,000 white residents .\n“ I think we will have a national conversation , not only about those inequities , but about how we get to solutions , because it ’ s not just about what ’ s going on right now , it ’ s really what has gone on for decades regarding structural racism , implicit bias , discriminatory housing policies and the like , ” said Dr. Patrice Harris , the immediate past president of the American Medical Association and the first African-American woman elected president of the organization .\nHarris said the AMA launched a Center for Health Equity a year and a half ago to address implicit bias at the physician and institutional level . During the pandemic , she said , many stories have emerged of black patients detailing how their needs were ignored or unmet by doctors , which some experts say is indicative of a historical mistrust of the medical system .\n“ We heard with COVID-19 , the stories , or some of the data that says that black men in particular were more likely to take advice from another black physician or that there have been studies where our younger colleagues believe the myth that blacks did not feel pain in the same way as whites , ” Harris said . “ AMA is going to lead these conversations and make sure everyone has information so we can address issues around implicit bias and discriminatory practices . ”\nThe nation must also begin to grapple with the psychological trauma of the pandemic , coupled with the economic fallout , the civil unrest in the wake of several high profile killings of African Americans and witnessing black grief on a mass scale , said University of Michigan health behavior and health education professor Enrique Neblett .\nNeblett , who studies the intersection of racism and health , said many African Americans could be dealing with depression , anxiety and other mental struggles .\n“ It ’ s the confluence of all these factors where it ’ s not just one or two things and that is really weighing hard and heavily on the psyche of black people , ” Neblett said . “ We do know that when you experience loss at unexpected times , there is scientific evidence showing that that ’ s related to worse health outcomes later on in life . I think these impacts may be generational . ”\nThe three COVID Impact surveys were conducted between April and June . The national survey uses a sample drawn from NORC ’ s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel , which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population . State and metropolitan area surveys were conducted using address-based sampling . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

The event came a little over a week after Ginsburg disclosed that she had completed three weeks of outpatient radiation therapy for a cancerous tumor on her pancreas and is now disease-free .\nIt is the fourth time over the past two decades that Ginsburg , the leader of the court ’ s liberal wing , has been treated for cancer . She had colorectal cancer in 1999 , pancreatic cancer in 2009 and lung cancer surgery in December . Both liberals and conservatives watch the health of the court ’ s oldest justice closely because it ’ s understood the Supreme Court would shift right for decades if Republican President Donald Trump were to get the ability to nominate someone to replace her .\nOn Saturday , Ginsburg , who came out with the book “ My Own Words ” in 2016 , spoke to an audience of more than 4,000 at Washington ’ s convention center . Near the beginning of an hour-long talk , her interviewer , NPR reporter Nina Totenberg , said : “ Let me ask you a question that everyone here wants to ask , which is : How are you feeling ? Why are you here instead of resting up for the term ? And are you planning on staying in your current job ? ”\n“ How am I feeling ?

Four members of the Chinese military have been charged with breaking into the networks of the Equifax credit reporting agency and stealing the personal information of tens of millions of Americans , the Justice Department said Monday , blaming Beijing for one of the largest hacks in history . ( AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin )\nWASHINGTON ( AP ) — Four members of the Chinese military have been charged with breaking into the computer networks of the Equifax credit reporting agency and stealing the personal information of tens of millions of Americans , the Justice Department said Monday , blaming Beijing for one of the largest hacks in history to target consumer data .\nThe hackers in the 2017 breach stole the personal information of roughly 145 million Americans , collecting names , addresses , Social Security and driver ’ s license numbers and other data stored in the company ’ s databases . The intrusion damaged the company ’ s reputation and underscored China ’ s increasingly aggressive and sophisticated intelligence-gathering methods .\n“ The scale of the theft was staggering , ” Attorney General William Barr said Monday in announcing the indictment . “ This theft not only caused significant financial damage to Equifax , but invaded the privacy of many millions of Americans , and imposed substantial costs and burdens on them as they have had to take measures to protect against identity theft . ”\nThe case is the latest U.S. accusation against Chinese hackers suspected of breaching networks of American corporations , including steel manufacturers , a hotel chain and a health insurer . It comes as the Trump administration has warned against what it sees as the growing political and economic influence of China , and efforts by Beijing to collect data for financial and intelligence purposes and to steal research and innovation .\nThe indictment arrives at a delicate time in relations between Washington and Beijing . Even as President Donald Trump points to a preliminary trade pact with China as evidence of his ability to work with the Communist government , other members of his administration have been warning against cybersecurity and surveillance risks posed by China , especially as the tech giant Huawei seeks to become part of new , high-speed 5G wireless networks across the globe .\nExperts and U.S. officials say the Equifax theft is consistent with the Chinese government ’ s interest in accumulating as much information about Americans as possible .\nThe data can be used by China to target U.S. government officials and ordinary citizens , including possible spies , and to find weaknesses and vulnerabilities that can be exploited — such as for purposes of blackmail . The FBI has not seen that happen yet in this case , said Deputy Director David Bowdich , though he said it “ doesn ’ t mean it will or will not happen in the future . ”\n“ We have to be able to recognize that as a counterintelligence issue , not a cyber issue , ” Bill Evanina , the U.S. government ’ s top counterintelligence official , said of the Equifax case .\nThe four accused hackers are suspected members of the People ’ s Liberation Army , an arm of the Chinese military that was blamed in 2014 for a series of intrusions into American corporations .\nProsecutors say they exploited a software vulnerability to gain access to Equifax ’ s computers , obtaining log-in credentials that they used to navigate databases and review records . They also took steps to cover their tracks , the indictment says , wiping log files on a daily basis and routing traffic through about three dozen servers in nearly 20 countries .\nBesides stealing personal information , the hackers also made off with some of the company ’ s sensitive trade secrets , including database designs , law enforcement officials said .\nEquifax , headquartered in Atlanta , maintains a massive repository of consumer information that it sells to businesses looking to verify identities or assess creditworthiness . All told , the indictment says , the company holds information on hundreds of millions of people in America and abroad .\nNone of the accused hackers is in U.S. custody . But officials nonetheless hope criminal charges can be a deterrent to foreign hackers and a warning to other countries that American law enforcement has the capability to pinpoint individual culprits . Even so , while China and the U.S. committed in 2015 to halt acts of cyber espionage against each other , the Equifax intrusion and others like it make clear that Beijing has continued its operations .\nA spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not return an email seeking comment Monday .\nThe case resembles a 2014 indictment that accused five members of the PLA of hacking into American corporations to steal trade secrets . U.S. authorities also suspect China in the 2015 breach of the federal Office of Personnel Management and of intrusions into the Marriott hotel chain and health insurer Anthem .\nSuch hacks “ seem to deliberately cast a wide net ” so that Chinese intelligence analysts can get deep insight into the lives of Americans , said Ben Buchanan , a Georgetown University scholar and author of the upcoming book “ The Hacker and the State . ”\n“ This could be especially useful for counterintelligence purposes , like tracking American spies posted to Beijing , ” Buchanan said .\nBarr , who at an event last week warned of Beijing ’ s aspirations of economic dominance , said Monday the U.S. has long “ witnessed China ’ s voracious appetite for the personal data of Americans . ”\n“ This kind of attack on American industry is of a piece with other Chinese illegal acquisitions of sensitive personal data , ” Barr said .\nThe criminal charges , which include conspiracy to commit computer fraud and conspiracy to commit economic espionage , were filed in federal court in Atlanta .\nEquifax last year reached a $ 700 million settlement over the data breach , with the bulk of the funds intended for consumers affected by it .\nEquifax officials told the Government Accountability Office the company made many mistakes , including having an outdated list of computer systems administrators . The company didn ’ t notice the intruders targeting its databases for more than six weeks . Hackers exploited a known security vulnerability that Equifax hadn ’ t fixed .\nWhile company stock has recovered , Equifax ’ s reputation has not fully . The company was dragged in front of Congress no less than four times to explain what happened .\nThe company is about to start paying out claims on its $ 700 million settlement , of which more claimants have opted in to getting a cash settlement than accept credit counseling .

( AP Photo/Alex Brandon )\nWASHINGTON ( AP ) — The Treasury Department and Federal Reserve have lent hardly any money under a $ 500 billion fund created by the economic rescue law passed in response to the coronavirus crisis , a congressional oversight panel says in a new report .\nThe Treasury fund is being used to guarantee new , expansive Federal Reserve lending programs to companies , states and cities that could be leveraged to reach as much as $ 4.5 trillion .\nSo far only one of the new Fed programs has started operating , a lending fund likely to be tapped by large public companies , the report by the Congressional Oversight Commission said . The program was started on May 11 with $ 37.5 billion from Treasury .\nThe oversight panel issued its first report Monday even though it still does not have a chairman . House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif. , and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , have not agreed on a chair , leaving the five-member commission without a leader .\nThe commission has four other members appointed by congressional leaders . They produced a 17-page report that contains mostly questions about how the Treasury fund is going to function .\nFor instance , the panel asked how Treasury and the Fed will assess the program ’ s success or failure . If the agencies use economy-wide metrics , such as economic growth , unemployment rates or wage growth , “ how will they isolate the effects of this program from other factors , including other federal and state relief measures ? ″ the commission asked .\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is pledging to reveal names and other details of entities that borrow from emergency programs the central bank has set up to offset the economic hit from the pandemic . In prepared testimony for a Tuesday congressional hearing , Powell says the Fed will disclose amounts borrowed and interest rates levied under programs to provide credit for large corporations , state and local governments and medium-sized businesses .\nHe and other officials “ recognize that the need for transparency is heightened when we are called upon to use our emergency powers , ” Powell ’ s testimony says .\nThe Fed slashed its benchmark interest rate to near zero as stock markets plunged in March and bond markets froze . The Fed has also intervened by buying $ 2.1 trillion in bonds in an effort to keep interest rates low and smooth the flow of credit .\nPowell said Sunday on CBS ’ “ 60 Minutes ” that Congress and the Fed must be prepared to provide additional financial support to prevent permanent damage to the economy from widespread bankruptcies among small businesses and long-term unemployment .\nThe $ 500 billion Treasury fund includes $ 46 billion to make loans and loan guarantees to the airline industry , which has been hit hard by the pandemic as air traffic has come to a near halt . None of that money has been disbursed .\nThe Federal Reserve is setting up a Main Street Lending Program intended to facilitate lending by banks to small and medium-size businesses . The program would support lending up to $ 600 billion , with Treasury providing $ 75 billion to offset any potential losses . That program also has not disbursed any money , the report said .\nThe economic rescue law , also known as the Cares Act , imposed a number of restrictions on the use of the Treasury fund . For example , none of the $ 500 billion can support an entity in which top Trump administration officials , members of Congress , or certain family members have a controlling interest .\nThe Fed says it takes time to ensure that the program includes legal language that protects taxpayers . The Fed was criticized for failing to ensure such safeguards during the 2008 financial crisis , most notably to bail out insurance giant AIG .\nThe failure by Pelosi and McConnell to agree on a chair for the oversight head has disappointed watchdog groups that have pushed for stricter oversight of the $ 2 trillion rescue law . Representatives for Pelosi and McConnell said they had no update on when the oversight position would be filled .\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is set to testify along with Powell on Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee .\nMnuchin says in prepared testimony that the Paycheck Protection Program to provide forgiveable loans to small businesses has processed more than 4.2 million loans worth over $ 530 billion . The program is working “ to keep tens of millions of hardworking Americans on the payroll , ″ Mnuchin says . The loans don ’ t have to be paid back as long as the borrower uses 75 % of the money to cover payroll . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

Enforcement of the law had been on hold pending the legal challenge but will begin shortly , said Steve Pitt , general counsel to Kentucky Gov . Matt Bevin .\nThe American Civil Liberties Union had challenged the law on behalf of Kentucky ’ s lone remaining abortion clinic . The ACLU argued that “ display and describe ” ultrasound laws violate physicians ’ speech rights under the First Amendment .\nThe federal appeals court in Cincinnati upheld the Kentucky law , but its sister court in Richmond , Virginia , struck down a similar measure in North Carolina .\nThe Supreme Court had previously upheld “ informed consent ” laws for women seeking abortions . The court will hear an abortion case in March , over Louisiana ’ s attempt to require doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at local hospitals .\nDoctors ’ speech also has been an issue in non-abortion cases . The federal appeals court in Atlanta struck down parts of a 2011 Florida law that sought to prohibit doctors from talking about gun safety with their patients . Under the law , doctors faced fines and the possible loss of their medical licenses for discussing guns with patients .\nIn Kentucky , doctors must describe the ultrasound in detail while the pregnant woman listens to the fetal heartbeat . Women can avert their eyes and cover their ears to avoid hearing the description or the fetal heartbeat . Doctors failing to comply face fines and can be referred to the state ’ s medical licensing board .\nThe ACLU called the law unconstitutional and unethical . ACLU lawyer Alexa Kolbi-Molinas said that the Supreme Court “ has rubber-stamped extreme political interference in the doctor-patient relationship . ”\nPitt painted a different picture of the law . “ It ’ s a five-minute procedure that takes place before the abortion is performed to give women who might have a lack of understanding of what ’ s actually in the womb , that this is a real living human being there , they might change their mind , ” he said .\nThe high court ’ s decision not to review the ultrasound case came on Bevin ’ s final day in office . Bevin , a Republican , is an outspoken abortion opponent . During his term , he signed a series of measures passed by the GOP-led legislature that put limits and conditions on abortion , including the 2017 ultrasound law . Those laws have triggered several legal challenges .\nBevin was defeated in last month ’ s election by Democratic Attorney General Andy Beshear , but Republicans remain in control of the state legislature .\n███ writer Bruce Schreiner contributed to this report from Frankfort , Ky . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

He won the largest share of women and men , including white college-educated women - a group that is expected to be especially important for Democrats to win against Republican President Donald Trump in November .\nAnd despite a public feud with Nevada ’ s 60,000-member Culinary Workers Union over his signature plan to replace private health insurance with a government program , Sanders won the largest share of the union vote . One of every three people who either belonged to a union or had a family member in a union said they would support Sanders .\nEdison ’ s polling also found Sanders won most of those caucus-goers who said they cared more about a candidate ’ s stance on the issues than their perceived electability .\nHere are some other highlights from the Edison poll , which was based on interviews with 2,746 Nevada Democrats , including about 1,780 as they entered early voting sites earlier in the week and another 966 on Saturday at 30 locations around the state :\n* * Among Hispanics , 53 % said they were going to support Sanders ahead of the caucuses .\n* * Among African Americans , 36 % said they supported former Vice President Joe Biden , while 27 % favored Sanders and 18 % backed billionaire Tom Steyer .\n* * Among caucus-goers who are members of a labor union or have family members in a union , 34 % said they planned to caucus for Sanders . About one in four caucus-goers said they were part of a union family .\n* * 62 % said they support replacing all private health insurance with a single government plan . That initiative , also known as Medicare for All , is a signature issue for Sanders and U.S . Senator Elizabeth Warren . It was criticized earlier this month by the state ’ s Culinary Workers Union in what was seen as a boost for more moderate Democrats who are still in the race .\n* * 43 % of Democratic Nevada caucus-goers say healthcare is the issue that mattered most to them when deciding which candidate to support . Another 25 % said it was climate change , 18 % said it was income inequality and 9 % said foreign policy .\n* * Among white , college-educated women , 22 % said they planned to caucus for Sanders , compared with 19 % for Klobuchar , 18 % for Warren , 17 % for Buttigieg and 13 % for Biden .\n* * Sanders had the largest share of support from caucus-goers of all age groups , except those 65 and older . Among the 65-plus group , 28 % said in entrance polling that they supported Biden , 20 % supported Klobuchar , 14 % supported Buttigieg and 12 % supported Sanders .\n* * 52 % of those participating in the Democratic caucus were doing so for the first time . A record number of Democrats were expected to have attended the Nevada caucuses , in part because of population growth in the state and also the party ’ s decision to allow residents to vote early this year for the first time .\n* * 65 % say that when picking a candidate to support , they are thinking mostly about that person ’ s electability instead of whether the candidate agrees with them on major issues .\n* * 66 % of Democratic caucus-goers said they considered themselves to be liberal .

Eighty-three percent of Democratic caucus-goers said they made their pick for the party ’ s nomination more than a few days before the caucus .\n* * About half of the poll respondents were college graduates .

( AP Photo/Susan Walsh )\nWASHINGTON ( AP ) — The Supreme Court delivered a setback Monday to Montana homeowners who are seeking additional cleanup of arsenic left over from years of copper smelting .\nThe court said the homeowners can not proceed with efforts to decontaminate their own property near the shuttered Anaconda smelter without the permission of the Environmental Protection Agency . But it did not order an end to the state court lawsuit that was under review .\nThe smelter , near the town of Opportunity , Montana , belongs to BP-owned Atlantic Richfield Co. and sits at the center of a 300-square-mile Superfund site . The company says it has spent $ 470 million to clean the site .\nHomeowners who are dissatisfied with the EPA-ordered cleanup want Atlantic Richfield to pay for the removal of more arsenic-tainted soil from their properties . And the Montana Supreme Court ruled in 2017 that their claims could proceed in state court .\nBut Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the high court that federal environmental law requires the homeowners to seek EPA approval for additional cleanup . “ That approval process , if pursued , could ameliorate any conflict between the landowners ’ restoration plan and EPA ’ s Superfund cleanup , just as Congress envisioned , ” Roberts wrote .\nJustice Neil Gorsuch wrote in a dissent that Justice Clarence Thomas joined that the court ’ s reading of the Superfund law “ strips away ancient common law rights from innocent landowners and forces them to suffer toxic waste in their backyards , playgrounds , and farms . Respectfully , that is not what the law was written to do ; that is what it was written to prevent . ”\nAn EPA spokesperson said the agency is reviewing the decision . The EPA backed Atlantic Richfield in the Supreme Court , urging several ways in which the justices could rule against the homeowners .\nJoseph Palmore , who represented the homeowners at the Supreme Court , said he was pleased the court did not dismiss his clients ’ suit . “ We look forward to working with the EPA toward a clean-up that will protect the environment and safeguard the health and property of the residents of Opportunity , ” Palmore said . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

Mr Trump has always denied the charge , describing the inquiry as a witch hunt .\nThe 47-month sentence is far shorter than what was recommended by US Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller .\nMr Mueller is thought to be finishing up his 22-month investigation , which has dogged the Trump presidency .\nManafort , 69 , is due to be sentenced in another case next week related to his illegal lobbying .\nHis sentencing marks a spectacular downfall for a Republican political guru who advised four US presidents , including Mr Trump , and foreign leaders .\nManafort - who will receive credit for time served - must also pay $ 24m ( £18m ) in restitution and a $ 50,000 fine .\nHe addressed the court on Thursday evening in Alexandria , Virginia , saying `` the last two years have been the most difficult of my life '' .\n`` To say I am humiliated and ashamed would be a gross understatement , '' he added , asking the judge to be `` compassionate '' .\nHe described his life as `` professionally and financially in shambles '' .\nJudge TS Ellis said he was surprised that Manafort did not `` express regret for engaging in wrongful conduct '' .\nThe formerly dapper lobbyist - who entered the court wearing a green prison jumpsuit and in a wheelchair - was impassive as he learned his fate .\nJudge Ellis said sentencing guidelines cited by prosecutors calling for between 19.5 and 24 years in prison were `` excessive '' compared to sentences for similar crimes .\n`` The government can not sweep away the history of all these previous sentences , '' he said . `` Clearly the guidelines were way out of whack on this . ''\nHe added that Manafort had lived an `` otherwise blameless '' life where he `` earned the admiration of a number of people '' .\nUS Senator Amy Klobuchar , who is running for the Democratic nomination for president , said Manafort had `` led far from a 'blameless life ' '' .\nMeanwhile , ex-CIA Director John Brennan described it as `` an extraordinarily lenient sentence ... Paul Manafort has a demonstrated track record of criminal , unethical , unprincipled behaviour . ''\nOthers have contrasted Manafort 's sentence with those convicted of other crimes , arguing that the US legal system is lenient on white collar crime .\nOne lawyer highlighted how his client was offered between 36 and 72 months for stealing $ 100 ( £76 ) .\nHe added that he was `` not advocating for worse treatment for all '' , but wished his clients would get the `` same treatment as the privileged few '' .\nNews website USA Today points out that , in the district where Manafort was sentenced , those convicted of fraud are normally jailed for an average of 36 months .\nLegal experts have also pointed out that Judge Ellis has a history of criticising mandatory minimum sentences - including those for drug and gun crimes - as he believes judges should have more discretion over jail sentences .\nA jury in Alexandria , Virginia , convicted Manafort last August of five counts of tax fraud , two counts of bank fraud , and one count of failing to declare a foreign bank account .\nThe judge , however , declared a mistrial on 10 other fraud-related charges .\nManafort was indicted for hiding $ 55m in offshore bank accounts in Cyprus , money he was paid as a political consultant for pro-Russian Ukrainian politicians .\nProsecutors say Manafort failed to pay more than $ 6m in taxes , as he funded his opulent lifestyle , including a $ 15,000 ostrich-skin jacket and a luxury renovation of his mansion in the Hamptons .\nManafort served three months as Trump 's campaign chairman until August 2016 , when he was forced to resign over his previous work in Ukraine .\nHe was the first former Trump aide to be arrested in the special counsel investigation , in October 2017 .\nHis legal team has previously said he suffers from debilitating foot pain resulting from gout as a result of his incarceration .\nManafort 's bail was revoked for alleged witness-tampering and he has been held in solitary confinement for nine months .\nWhen news of the solitary confinement first emerged it caused controversy , with commentators describing it as a form of `` torture '' .\nManafort 's lawyers acknowledged that the solitary confinement was put in place to guarantee Manafort 's safety , but argued that he should not have been detained at all .\nThey said Manafort was `` locked in his cell for at least 23 hours per day '' and could not adequately prepare his defence .\nMr Mueller said Manafort had enjoyed privileges in solitary confinement including `` a private , self-contained living unit , which is larger than other inmates ' units , his own bathroom and shower facility , his own personal telephone , and his own workspace to prepare for trial . ''\nAccording to court filings submitted by Mr Mueller 's team , Mr Manafort said on monitored phone calls from jail that he was `` being treated like a 'VIP ' '' .\nManafort has not been charged with anything related to the special counsel 's investigation into an alleged Russian plot to influence the 2016 US presidential election .\nManafort 's lawyers had argued that the charges were outside the special counsel 's remit .\nHowever , Democrats point out that a Washington DC judge last month backed the special counsel 's contention that Manafort lied about his contacts with Konstantin Kilimnik , an aide alleged to have ties to Russian intelligence .\nIn February , Manafort 's lawyers inadvertently revealed in a court filing that their client had shared polling data about the 2016 Trump campaign with Mr Kilimnik .\nThe president 's critics also highlight that Manafort was present at a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between campaign staff and a Kremlin-linked Russian lawyer promising `` dirt '' on then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton .\nDuring sentencing the judge noted that the charges do not relate to alleged Russian meddling , leading to Mr Trump to claim vindication in a tweet mischaracterising the judge 's remarks .\nManafort is due to be sentenced next Wednesday in another case brought by the special counsel , this time in Washington DC .\nHe pleaded guilty in September to two felony counts - conspiracy against the United States and conspiracy to obstruct justice - related to his lobbying .\nHe also agreed to co-operate with the special counsel inquiry in a deal for a possible lighter sentence .\nHowever , just two months later that plea deal collapsed as investigators said Manafort had repeatedly lied to the government . He faces a maximum of 10 years in the case .\nPresident Trump , who frequently denounces the Mueller investigation , has not ruled out granting a presidential pardon to Manafort .\nHe said in November : `` I would n't take it off the table . ''\nThe special counsel is expected soon to submit his report to US Attorney General William Barr .\nThe political world is feverishly anticipating findings on whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russia , or if Mr Trump unlawfully sought to obstruct the inquiry .\nMr Trump has denied collusion and obstruction and Russia has denied election interference .\nFive other Trump aides have been charged in connection with Mr Mueller 's investigation .\nNone have been indicted with criminally conspiring to subvert the 2016 election .\nFormer campaign staff Rick Gates and George Papadopoulos , former US National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen have all pleaded guilty . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

The Archdiocese of New York received 15 loans worth at least $ 28 million just for its top executive offices . St. Patrick ’ s Cathedral on Fifth Avenue was approved for at least $ 1 million . ( AP Photo/Seth Wenig )\nNEW YORK ( AP ) — The U.S. Roman Catholic Church used a special and unprecedented exemption from federal rules to amass at least $ 1.4 billion in taxpayer-backed coronavirus aid , with many millions going to dioceses that have paid huge settlements or sought bankruptcy protection because of clergy sexual abuse cover-ups .\nThe church ’ s haul may have reached -- or even exceeded -- $ 3.5 billion , making a global religious institution with more than a billion followers among the biggest winners in the U.S. government ’ s pandemic relief efforts , an ███ analysis of federal data released this week found .\nHouses of worship and faith-based organizations that promote religious beliefs aren ’ t usually eligible for money from the U.S. Small Business Administration . But as the economy plummeted and jobless rates soared , Congress let faith groups and other nonprofits tap into the Paycheck Protection Program , a $ 659 billion fund created to keep Main Street open and Americans employed .\nBy aggressively promoting the payroll program and marshaling resources to help affiliates navigate its shifting rules , Catholic dioceses , parishes , schools and other ministries have so far received approval for at least 3,500 forgivable loans , AP found .\nThe Archdiocese of New York , for example , received 15 loans worth at least $ 28 million just for its top executive offices . Its iconic St. Patrick ’ s Cathedral on Fifth Avenue was approved for at least $ 1 million .\nIn Orange County , California , where a sparkling glass cathedral estimated to cost over $ 70 million recently opened , diocesan officials working at the complex received four loans worth at least $ 3 million .\nAnd elsewhere , a loan of at least $ 2 million went to the diocese covering Wheeling-Charleston , West Virginia , where a church investigation revealed last year that then-Bishop Michael Bransfield embezzled funds and made sexual advances toward young priests .\nSimply being eligible for low-interest loans was a new opportunity . But the church couldn ’ t have been approved for so many loans -- which the government will forgive if they are used for wages , rent and utilities -- without a second break .\nReligious groups persuaded the Trump administration to free them from a rule that typically disqualifies an applicant with more than 500 workers . Without this preferential treatment , many Catholic dioceses would have been ineligible because -- between their head offices , parishes and other affiliates -- their employees exceed the 500-person cap .\n“ The government grants special dispensation , and that creates a kind of structural favoritism , ” said Micah Schwartzman , a University of Virginia law professor specializing in constitutional issues and religion who has studied the Paycheck Protection Program . “ And that favoritism was worth billions of dollars . ”\nThe amount that the church collected , between $ 1.4 billion and $ 3.5 billion , is an undercount . The Diocesan Fiscal Management Conference , an organization of Catholic financial officers , surveyed members and reported that about 9,000 Catholic entities received loans . That is nearly three times the number of Catholic recipients the AP could identify .\nThe AP couldn ’ t find more Catholic beneficiaries because the government ’ s data , released after pressure from Congress and a lawsuit from news outlets including the AP , didn ’ t name recipients of loans under $ 150,000 -- a category in which many smaller churches would fall . And because the government released only ranges of loan amounts , it wasn ’ t possible to be more precise .\nEven without a full accounting , AP ’ s analysis places the Catholic Church among the major beneficiaries in the Paycheck Protection Program , which also has helped companies backed by celebrities , billionaires , state governors and members of Congress .\nThe program was open to all religious groups , and many took advantage . Evangelical advisers to President Donald Trump , including his White House spiritual czar , Paula White-Cain , also received loans .\nThere is no doubt that state shelter-in-place orders disrupted houses of worship and businesses alike .\nMasses were canceled , even during the Holy Week and Easter holidays , depriving parishes of expected revenue and contributing to layoffs in some dioceses . Some families of Catholic school students are struggling to make tuition payments . And the expense of disinfecting classrooms once classes resume will put additional pressure on budgets .\nBut other problems were self-inflicted . Long before the pandemic , scores of dioceses faced increasing financial pressure because of a dramatic rise in recent clergy sex abuse claims .\nThe scandals that erupted in 2018 reverberated throughout the world . Pope Francis ordered the former archbishop of Washington , Cardinal Theodore McCarrick , to a life of “ prayer and penance ” following allegations he abused minors and adult seminarians . And a damning grand jury report about abuse in six Pennsylvania dioceses revealed bishops had long covered for predator priests , spurring investigations in more than 20 other states .\nAs the church again reckoned with its longtime crisis , abuse reports tripled during the year ending June 2019 to a total of nearly 4,500 nationally . Meanwhile , dioceses and religious orders shelled out $ 282 million that year — up from $ 106 million just five years earlier . Most of that went to settlements , in addition to legal fees and support for offending clergy .\nLoan recipients included about 40 dioceses that have spent hundreds of millions of dollars in the past few years paying victims through compensation funds or bankruptcy proceedings . AP ’ s review found that these dioceses were approved for about $ 200 million , though the value is likely much higher .\nOne was the New York Archdiocese . As a successful battle to lift the statute of limitations on the filing of child sexual abuse lawsuits gathered steam , Cardinal Timothy Dolan established a victim compensation fund in 2016 . Since then , other dioceses have established similar funds , which offer victims relatively quick settlements while dissuading them from filing lawsuits .\nSpokesperson Joseph Zwilling said the archdiocese simply wanted to be “ treated equally and fairly under the law. ” When asked about the waiver from the 500-employee cap that religious organizations received , Zwilling deferred to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops .\nA spokesperson for the bishops ’ conference acknowledged its officials lobbied for the paycheck program , but said the organization wasn ’ t tracking what dioceses and Catholic agencies received .\n“ These loans are an essential lifeline to help faith-based organizations to stay afloat and continue serving those in need during this crisis , ” spokesperson Chieko Noguchi said in a written statement . According to AP ’ s data analysis , the church and all its organizations reported retaining at least 407,900 jobs with the money they were awarded .\nNoguchi also wrote the conference felt strongly that “ the administration write and implement this emergency relief fairly for all applicants . ”\nNot every Catholic institution sought government loans . The Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy based in Stamford , Connecticut , told AP that even though its parishes experienced a decline in donations , none of the organizations in its five-state territory submitted applications .\nDeacon Steve Wisnowski , a financial officer for the eparchy , said pastors and church managers used their rainy-day savings and that parishioners responded generously with donations . As a result , parishes “ did not experience a severe financial crisis . ”\nWisnowski said his superiors understood the program was for “ organizations and businesses truly in need of assistance . ”\nThe law that created the Paycheck Protection Program let nonprofits participate , as long as they abided by SBA ’ s “ affiliation rule. ” The rule typically says that only businesses with fewer than 500 employees , including at all subsidiaries , are eligible .\nLobbying by the church helped religious organizations get an exception .\nThe Catholic News Service reported that the bishops ’ conference and several major Catholic nonprofit agencies worked throughout the week of March 30 to ensure that the “ unique nature of the entities would not make them ineligible for the program ” because of how SBA defines a “ small ” business . Those conversations came just days after President Trump signed the $ 2 trillion Coronavirus Aid , Relief , and Economic Security Act , which included the Paycheck Protection Program .\nIn addition , federal records show the Los Angeles archdiocese , whose leader heads the bishops ’ conference , paid $ 20,000 to lobby the U.S. Senate and House on “ eligibility for non-profits ” under the CARES Act . The records also show that Catholic Charities USA , a social service arm of the church with member agencies in dioceses across the country , paid another $ 30,000 to lobby on the act and other issues .\nIn late April , after thousands of Catholic institutions had secured loans , several hundred Catholic leaders pressed for additional help on a call with President Trump . During the call , Trump underscored the coming presidential election and touted himself as the candidate best aligned with religious conservatives , boasting he was the “ best ( president ) the Catholic church has ever seen , ” according to Crux , an online publication that covers church-related news .\nCatholic Charities USA and its member agencies were approved for about 110 loans worth between $ 90 million and $ 220 million at least , according to the data .\nIn a statement , Catholic Charities said : “ Each organization is a separate legal entity under the auspices of the bishop in the diocese in which the agency is located . CCUSA supports agencies that choose to become members , but does not have any role in their daily operations or governance . ”\nThe Los Angeles archdiocese told AP in a survey that reporters sent before the release of federal data that 247 of its 288 parishes -- and all but one of its 232 schools -- received loans . The survey covered more than 180 dioceses and eparchies .\nLike most dioceses , Los Angeles wouldn ’ t disclose its total dollar amount . While the federal data doesn ’ t link Catholic recipients to their home dioceses , AP found 37 loans to the archdiocese and its affiliates worth between $ 9 million and $ 23 million , including one for its downtown cathedral .\nIn 2007 , the archdiocese paid a record $ 660 million to settle sex abuse claims from more than 500 victims . Spokespeople for Los Angeles Archbishop Jose M. Gomez did not respond to additional questions about the archdiocese ’ s finances and lobbying .\nIn program materials , SBA officials said they provided the affiliation waiver to religious groups in deference to their unique organizational structure , and because the public health response to slow the coronavirus ’ spread disrupted churches just as it did businesses .\nA senior official in the U.S. Department of the Treasury , which worked with the SBA to administer the program , acknowledged in a statement the wider availability of loans to religious organizations . “ The CARES Act expanded eligibility to include nonprofits in the PPP , and SBA ’ s regulations ensured that no eligible religious nonprofit was excluded from participation due to its beliefs or denomination , ” the statement said .\nMeanwhile , some legal experts say that the special consideration the government gave faith groups in the loan program has further eroded the wall between church and state provided in the First Amendment . With that erosion , religious groups that don ’ t pay taxes have gained more access to public money , said Marci Hamilton , a University of Pennsylvania professor and attorney who has represented clergy abuse victims on constitutional issues during bankruptcy proceedings .\n“ At this point , the argument is you ’ re anti-religious if in fact you would say the Catholic Church shouldn ’ t be getting government funding , ” Hamilton said .\nAfter its lobbying blitz , the Catholic Church worked with parishes and schools to access the money .\nMany dioceses -- from large ones such as the Archdiocese of Boston to smaller ones such as the Diocese of La Crosse , Wisconsin -- assembled how-to guides to help their affiliates apply . The national Catholic fiscal conference also hosted multiple webinars with legal and financial experts to help coach along local leaders .\nFederal data show that the bulk of the church ’ s money was approved during the loan program ’ s first two weeks . That ’ s when demand for the first-come , first-served assistance was so high that the initial $ 349 billion was quickly exhausted , shutting out many local businesses .\nOverall , nearly 500 loans approved to Catholic entities exceeded $ 1 million each . The AP found that at least eight hit the maximum range of $ 5 million to $ 10 million . Many of the listed recipients were the offices of bishops , headquarters of leading religious orders , major churches , schools and chapters of Catholic Charities .\nAlso among recipients was the Saint Luke Institute . The Catholic treatment center for priests accused of sexual abuse and those suffering from other disorders received a loan ranging from $ 350,000 to $ 1 million . Based in Silver Spring , Maryland , the institute has at times been a way station for priests accused of sexual abuse who returned to active ministry only to abuse again .\nPerhaps nothing illustrates the church ’ s aggressive pursuit of funds better than four dioceses that sued the federal government to receive loans , even though they entered bankruptcy proceedings due to mounting clergy sex-abuse claims . Small Business Administration rules prohibit loans to applicants in bankruptcy .\nThe Archdiocese of Santa Fe , New Mexico -- once home to a now-closed and notorious treatment center for predator priests -- prevailed in court , clearing the way for its administrative offices to receive nearly $ 1 million . It accused the SBA of overreaching by blocking bankruptcy applications when Congress didn ’ t spell that out .\nYet even when a diocese has lost in bankruptcy court , or its case is pending , its affiliated parishes , schools and other organizations remain eligible for loans .\nOn the U.S. territory of Guam , well over 200 clergy abuse lawsuits led church leaders in the tiny Archdiocese of Agana to seek bankruptcy protection , as they estimated at least $ 45 million in liabilities . Even so , the archdiocese ’ s parishes , schools and other organizations have received at least $ 1.7 million as it sues the SBA for approval to get a loan for its headquarters , according to bankruptcy filings .\nThe U.S. church may have a troubling record on sex abuse , but Bishop Lawrence Persico of Erie , Pennsylvania , pushed back on the idea that dioceses should be excluded from the government ’ s rescue package . Approximately 80 organizations within his diocese received loans worth $ 10.3 million , the diocese said , with most of the money going to parishes and schools .\nPersico pointed out that church entities help feed , clothe and shelter the poor -- and in doing so keep people employed .\n“ I know some people may react with surprise that government funding helped support faith-based schools , parishes and dioceses , ” he said . “ The separation of church and state does not mean that those motivated by their faith have no place in the public square . ”\nContact the reporters on Twitter at https : //twitter.com/ReeseDunklin or https : //twitter.com/MikeRezendes . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

But he said at a White House event that “ maybe millions of lives ” have been saved by shutting down the economy .\nWith the crisis stabilizing in Europe and in many places in the U.S. , countries and states are gradually easing their restrictions amid warnings from health experts that a second wave of infections could hit unless testing for the virus is expanded dramatically .\nIn much of Colorado , people could get their hair cut and shop at stores again , though stay-at-home orders remained in place in Denver and surrounding counties . Wyoming let barbershops , nail salons , gyms and daycare centers reopen . In Maine , golf courses , hairdressers and dentists opened .\nHotels near South Carolina beaches opened and state parks unlocked their gates for the first time in more than a month . But in Myrtle Beach , the state ’ s most popular tourist destination , hotel elevators will be restricted to one person or one family — a potential inconvenience at the area ’ s 15- and 20-story resorts .\nTexas ’ reopening got underway with sparse crowds at shopping malls and restaurants allowing customers to dine in , though only at 25 % capacity in most places .

Doug Ducey ’ s stay-at-home order .\nAround the country , protesters have demanded governors reboot the battered economy . More than 100 people chanted and carried signs in front of Chicago ’ s Thompson Center , where Illinois Gov . J.B. Pritzker has an office , to call for an end to the statewide lockdown .\nPritzker has said he will not lift his order until it ’ s safe , and several counterprotesters expressed support for his position .

    "134": "Iran has declared that it will no longer abide by any of the restrictions imposed by the 2015 nuclear deal .\nIn a statement , it said it would no longer observe limitations on its capacity for enrichment , the level of enrichment , the stock of enriched material , or research and development .\nThe announcement followed a meeting of the Iranian cabinet in Tehran .\nTensions have been high over the killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani by the US in Baghdad .\nReports from Baghdad say the US embassy compound there was targeted in an attack on Sunday evening . A source told the BBC that four rounds of `` indirect fire `` had been launched in the direction of the embassy . There were no reports of casualties .\nHundreds of thousands turned out in Iran on Sunday to give Soleimani a hero 's welcome ahead of his funeral on Tuesday .\nEarlier , Iraqi MPs had passed a non-binding resolution calling for foreign troops to leave the country after the general 's killing in a drone strike at Baghdad airport on Friday .\nAbout 5,000 US soldiers are in Iraq as part of the international coalition against the Islamic State ( IS ) group . The coalition paused operations against IS in Iraq just before Sunday 's vote .\nPresident Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened that the US will strike back at Iran in the event of retaliation for Soleimani 's death , and said it could do so `` perhaps in a disproportionate manner '' .\nThe 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran , on life support ever since the Trump administration abandoned it in May 2018 , may now be in its final death throes .\nDonald Trump , throughout his presidential campaign and then as president , has never failed to rail against what he calls his predecessor President Barack Obama 's `` bad deal '' . But all its other signatories - the UK , France , Russia , China , Germany and the EU - believe that it still has merit .\nThe agreement , known as the JCPOA , constrained Iran 's nuclear programme for a set period in a largely verifiable way . But its greatest significance - even more so given the current crisis - is that it helped to avert an imminent war . Before it was signed , there was mounting concern about Tehran 's nuclear activities and every chance that Israel ( or possibly Israel and the US in tandem ) might attack Iran 's nuclear facilities .\nSince the US withdrawal , Iran has successively breached key constraints of the JCPOA . Now it appears to be throwing these constraints out altogether . What matters now is what precisely it decides to do . Will it up its level of uranium enrichment , for example , to 20 % ? This would reduce significantly the time it would take Tehran to obtain suitable material for a bomb . Will it continue to abide by enhanced international inspection measures ?\nWe are now at the destination the Trump administration clearly hoped for in May 2018 . But the major powers , while deeply unhappy about Iran 's breaches of the deal , are also shocked at the controversial decision by Mr Trump to kill the head of Iran 's Quds Force , a decision that has again brought the US and Iran to the brink of war .\nUnder the 2015 accord , Iran agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors in return for the lifting of crippling economic sanctions .\nUS President Donald Trump abandoned it in 2018 , saying he wanted to force Iran to negotiate a new deal that would place indefinite curbs on its nuclear programme and also halt its development of ballistic missiles .\nIran refused , and had since been gradually rolling back its commitments under the agreement . It had been expected to announce its latest stance on the agreement this weekend , before news of Soleimani 's death .\nIranian state media announced on Sunday that the country will no longer respect any limits laid down in the 2015 deal .\n`` Iran will continue its nuclear enrichment with no limitations and based on its technical needs , '' a statement said .\nHowever , the statement did not say that Iran was actually withdrawing from the agreement and it added that the country would continue to co-operate with the UN 's nuclear watchdog , the IAEA .\nIran , it said , was ready to return to its commitments once it enjoyed the benefits of the agreement . Correspondents say this is a reference to its inability to sell oil and have access to its income under US sanctions .\nThe country has always insisted that its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful - but suspicions that it was being used to develop a bomb covertly prompted the UN Security Council , US and EU to impose crippling sanctions in 2010 .\nThe 2015 deal was designed to constrain the programme in a verifiable way in return for sanctions relief .\nIt restricted Iran 's enrichment of uranium , which is used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons , to 3.67 % . Iran was also required to redesign a heavy-water reactor being built , whose spent fuel would contain plutonium suitable for a bomb , and allow international inspections .\nBefore July 2015 , Iran had a large stockpile of enriched uranium and almost 20,000 centrifuges , enough to create eight to 10 bombs , according to the White House at the time .\nUS experts estimated back then that if Iran had decided to rush to make a bomb , it would take two to three months until it had enough 90 % -enriched uranium to build a nuclear weapon - the so-called `` breakout time '' .\nIran 's current `` breakout time '' , should it attempt to build a nuclear bomb , is estimated to be around a year , but this could be reduced to half a year or even a matter of months if enrichment levels are increased to 20 % , for example .\nThe other parties to the 2015 deal - the UK , France , Germany , China and Russia - tried to keep the agreement alive after the US withdrew in 2018 .\nLate on Sunday , German Chancellor Angela Merkel , French President Emmanuel Macron and British PM Boris Johnson released a joint statement urging Iran to drop measures that go against the deal .\n`` We are ready to continue talks with all parties in order to contribute to de-escalating tensions and re-establishing stability in the region , '' they said .\nEarlier on Sunday Mr Johnson said `` we will not lament '' the death of Soleimani , describing him as `` a threat to all our interests '' .\nEU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has invited Iran 's Foreign Minister , Mohammad Javad Zarif , to visit Brussels to discuss both the nuclear deal and how to defuse the crisis over the Soleimani assassination . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

Republican Party representatives largely kept quiet .\nDespite the criticism , President Trump launched another Twitter tirade on Monday morning , calling on the women themselves to apologise .\nThe women - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley , and Ilhan Omar , who came to the US as a refugee aged 12 - all called the president racist and were backed by members of the Democratic Party .\nMs Ocasio-Cortez was born in the Bronx in New York , approximately 12 miles away from the Queens hospital where Mr Trump was born .\nMrs May resigned as leader of the UK 's governing Conservative Party in June after being unable to get a Brexit deal through parliament . Two candidates are currently vying to replace her as prime minister .\nIn Sunday 's three-tweet thread , Mr Trump accused the congresswomen of `` viciously '' criticising him and the US .\nThe president did not explicitly name the women , but the context - and references to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - made a clear link . He said Ms Pelosi would happily organise for them to leave the country .\nA week ago , Ms Pelosi clashed with the four women - sometimes nicknamed `` the squad '' - but she has since come to their defence following his tweets .\nThe president wrote : `` So interesting to see 'progressive ' Democrat congresswomen , who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe , the worst , most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world ( if they even have a functioning government at all ) , now loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States , the greatest and most powerful nation on earth , how our government is to be run .\n`` Why do n't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came .

So many people are angry at them and their horrible and disgusting actions , '' he said .\n`` If Democrats want to unite around the foul language and racist hatred spewed from the mouths and actions of these very unpopular and unrepresentative Congresswomen , it will be interesting to see how it plays out . I can tell you that they have made Israel feel abandoned by the US . ''\nMr Trump was referring to a prior row with Ms Omar , who has faced accusations of anti-Semitism over comments she made about Israel and pro-Israel lobbyists earlier this year .\nMs Tlaib , the other Muslim serving in Congress , has also had to defend herself from calls of anti-Semitism from Republicans after she discussed the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on a Yahoo News Podcast in May .\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signalled his dislike of Mr Trump 's comments , saying on Monday : `` That is not how we do things in Canada .

On Friday , Ms Ocasio-Cortez , Ms Tlaib and Ms Pressley testified to a House committee about conditions in a migrant detention centre they had visited . They expressed horror about alleged mistreatment happening `` under American flags '' .\nMs Ocasio-Cortez said migrants told her they had drunk water from toilets because sinks were broken .\nVice-President Mike Pence also toured a facility on Friday . He said everyone was being `` well cared for '' .\nThe president tweeted that children 's detention centres had had `` great reviews '' and the adult male areas were `` loaded up with a big percentage of criminals '' .\nMr Trump has been accused of racism before in connection with different incidents .\nFor years , he made false claims that former President Barack Obama was not born in the US - propagating the racist `` birther '' conspiracy .

There seems to be unnecessary noise and more collateral damage than there needs to be .\nBut who cares that you shanked the ball off the 3rd or hit the ball into the trees on the 5th and found the water on the 14th ? It 's all about how you get yourself out of the rough .\nThe recovery shot . The scramble out of trouble . And every time you think that President Trump finds his ball buried under the sand in a huge bunker , he seems somehow to chip the ball into the hole and emerge smiling .\nThe headlines have been dominated in recent days - understandably - by what is unfolding with the investigation of the special counsel , Robert Mueller , into whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia .\nWe have seen former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn pleading guilty to lying to the FBI , but more interesting is the fact that Flynn is now co-operating with the Mueller investigation .\nAnd we have seen some rather odd tweets from the president 's account , which now we 're being told were n't written by him .\nEvery day - sometimes it seems every hour - there is a new development that will dominate the news cycle .

Whatever .\nRows with basketball players for not being grateful enough barely make a puddle .\nAnd it 's my suspicion that in millions of homes across America ( particularly those that voted for Donald Trump just over a year ago ) this is all filtered out as so much noise and static .\nOf more interest will be the Senate passing a tax reform bill . And yes , while it will help billionaires more than it will low-paid America ( I suspect not that many will benefit from the tax relief on private jets ) , it will nevertheless benefit them a bit .\nAnd there are signs that wages are picking up for blue-collar workers .

There is a buoyancy out there .\nAnd if you are someone whose pension is tied up in the stock market , you will be looking at the performance of Wall Street and thinking that every day is Christmas , as this president will repeatedly remind you .\nThe performance of shares ( a fickle indicator ) has been extraordinary .

Just look at his Twitter feed - the multiple exclamation marks tell you what he thinks .\nAnd then you look at the president 's travel ban from six Muslim-majority countries - something which has caused a good deal of outrage around the world , but which was one of his populist key promises during the campaign .\nThe battle is not finished yet , and it may be months or even years before the Supreme Court delivers a final verdict .\nBut the justices gave the president an important fillip this week .

Joe Biden is the latest prominent politician to navigate this tricky terrain . ( AP Photo/Nick Wass , File )\nNEW YORK ( AP ) — Facing intense scrutiny from President Donald Trump and his Republican allies , Hunter Biden said Sunday he will step down from the board of directors of a Chinese-backed private equity firm at the end of the month as part of a pledge not to work on behalf of any foreign-owned companies should his father win the presidency .\nBiden , the 49-year-old son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden , revealed his plan in an internet post written by his attorney , George Mesires , who outlined a defense of the younger Biden ’ s work in Ukraine and China , which has emerged as one of Trump ’ s chief lines of attack against Hunter ’ s father despite no proof of impropriety .\n“ Hunter makes the following commitment : Under a Biden Administration , Hunter will readily comply with any and all guidelines or standards a President Biden may issue to address purported conflicts of interest , or the appearance of such conflicts , including any restrictions related to overseas business interests . In any event , Hunter will agree not to serve on boards of , or work on behalf of , foreign owned companies , ” Mesires wrote .\nHe continued : “ He will continue to keep his father personally uninvolved in his business affairs , while availing himself as necessary and appropriate to the Office of the White House Counsel to help inform his application of the Biden Administration ’ s guidelines or standards to his business decision-making . ”\nJoe Biden , speaking to reporters after a union forum in suburban Des Moines , Iowa , said his son did not discuss that decision with him before posting the statement .\n“ No one has asserted my son did a single thing wrong , ” Biden added , pounding his finger into the podium , “ except a lying president . ”\nAnd Biden promised to bar his family members from occupying any office within the White House and said they won ’ t “ sit in meetings as if they are a Cabinet member. ” That was a jab at Trump , who taps daughter Ivanka and her husband , Jared Kushner , as advisers . Biden did not say if his pledge meant that Jill Biden , his wife , would not get the office traditionally assigned to first ladies , should he win .\nHe further vowed that no one in his family will have “ any business relationship with anyone that relates to a foreign corporation or foreign country . ”\nHunter Biden ’ s work overseas sits at the center of the House impeachment inquiry into Trump , who has admitted to asking foreign powers to investigate Hunter Biden ’ s business dealings abroad .\nThe White House released a rough transcript of a call in which Trump asks Ukraine ’ s new president , Volodymyr Zelenskiy , to probe Biden ’ s family and Ukraine ’ s role in the 2016 election that put Trump in office . Trump has also encouraged China to dig into Hunter Biden ’ s work in that country , asserting without evidence that earned $ 1.5 billion from a “ sweetheart ” business deal there .\nThe president ’ s personal attorney , Rudy Giuliani , is also under increasing scrutiny for his efforts to dig into Hunter Biden ’ s business background . Late last week , two businessmen involved in Giuliani ’ s efforts to investigate Hunter Biden ’ s dealings in Ukraine were charged with federal campaign finance violations .\nStill , Republicans reacted to news of Hunter Biden ’ s decision to step away from the Chinese-backed BHR Equity Investment Fund Management Co. with deep skepticism .\n“ I think this is just another way to save a flailing campaign that ’ s going down , ” Georgia Rep. Doug Collins , the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee , said on Fox News Channel ’ s “ Sunday Morning Futures. ” ″He knows he ’ s in trouble and this is just another way to try and detract attention\nOn the same show , White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said Hunter Biden “ should have done this quite a while ago . ”\nMesires noted repeatedly that there is no evidence of wrongdoing against Hunter Biden , despite intensifying attacks from Trump before the 2020 election .\n“ Despite extensive scrutiny , at no time has any law enforcement agency , either domestic or foreign , alleged that Hunter engaged in wrongdoing at any point during his five-year term , ” Mesires said in his Sunday post of Biden ’ s experience in Ukraine .\nThe attorney wrote that Hunter Biden worked as an unpaid board member for BHR Equity Investment Fund Management Co. “ based on his interest in seeking ways to bring Chinese capital to international markets . ”\n“ To date , Hunter has not received any compensation for being on BHR ’ s board of directors , ” Mesires said . “ He has not received any return on his investment ; there have been no distributions to BHR shareholders since Hunter obtained his equity interest . ”\nOne of Biden ’ s Democratic presidential rivals praised the move , noting that Trump ’ s children are openly trading on his name in business deals around the world while Trump occupies the Oval Office .\n“ I think it demonstrates the difference in standards relative to the White House , ” said Pete Buttigieg , the mayor of South Bend , Indiana .\n“ I mean , here you have Hunter Biden stepping down from a position in order to make sure , even though there ’ s been no accusation of wrongdoing — doing something just to make sure there ’ s not even the appearance of a conflict of interests , while , in the White House , the president of the United States is a walking conflict of interest , ” he said . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

( AP Photo/Eraldo Peres )\nAn interfaith coalition is pressing the world ’ s largest brewer to remove the name of a Hindu god from a popular beer that dates to the late 1800s — a dispute the beermaker insists is a case of mistaken identity .\nThe group , which includes representatives of the Christian , Jewish , Buddhist , Hindu and Jain religions , is calling on Belgium-based brewing giant Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV to rename its Brahma line , a favorite in Brazil .\nBrahma was first produced in 1888 by Companhia Cervejaria Brahma , a Brazilian brewery now owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev , whose massive lineup of 500 brands includes Budweiser , Bud Light , Corona and Stella Artois . Beers sold under the Brahma name include a lager , a double malt , a wheat beer and a chocolate stout .\n“ It is the right time to fix an old wrong — the trivializing of the faith of our Hindu brothers and sisters for about 132 years , ” coalition spokesperson Rajan Zed told The ███ on Tuesday .\nLord Brahma , the god of creation in Hinduism , is a highly revered figure who should be worshiped in temples or home shrines , “ not misused as a ‘ toasting tool , ’ ” Zed said .\nHe said the coalition also objects to what it calls “ raunchy ” marketing of the brand by using the image of a scantily clad woman to promote the beers .\n“ Anheuser-Busch InBev should not be in the business of religious appropriation , sacrilege and ridiculing entire communities , ” the coalition said in a statement , calling on the company to “ prove that it cares about communities by renaming its Brahma beer . ”\nBut Lucas Rossi , head of communications for Anheuser-Busch InBev ’ s Latin America subsidiary , said Tuesday the beers were named in tribute to Joseph Bramah — an Englishman who invented the draft pump valve — and not for the Hindu deity . The spelling was changed , he said , to make the name work better in the Portuguese language .\n“ We deeply respect all religions , faiths and their histories , ” Rossi said in a telephone interview . Hindus are a tiny minority in Brazil , where the Brahma brand is “ very important to the culture of the country , ” he added .\n“ The stated history behind the name does not reduce the pain of the Hindu devotees when they see their creator god on alcohol cans , ” he said .\nZed , who is based in Nevada and is the president of the Universal Society of Hinduism , has campaigned against what he considers the misuse of Eastern religious imagery for commercial purposes for several years . In 2019 , he extracted an apology from a Virginia brewery that brewed a beer named for another Hindu deity , saying that associating Lord Hanuman with alcohol was disrespectful .\nLast month , the interfaith coalition launched a separate campaign aimed at pressuring Foundation Room and House of Blues nightclubs in Boston and other cities to stop using sacred Buddhist and Hindu imagery as decor . The upscale watering holes are managed by Beverly Hills , California-based Live Nation Entertainment , which apologized and said it was removing some statues from the clubs . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

There is no precedent for a US president pardoning himself .\nThe US constitution allows the president the `` power to grant reprieves and pardons for offences against the United States , except in cases of impeachment '' .\nA president could offer clemency , commutation or a full pardon , even if an individual has not been charged or convicted .

( AP Photo/J . Scott Applewhite )\nWASHINGTON ( AP ) — At a time when many Americans say they ’ re struggling to distinguish between fact and fiction , the country is broadly skeptical that facts underlie some of the basic mechanisms of democracy in the United States — from political campaigns to voting choices to the policy decisions made by elected officials .\nA meager 9 % of Americans believe that campaign messages are usually based on facts , according to a poll from The ███-NORC Center for Public Opinion Research and USAFacts . Only 14 % think policy decisions are often or always fact-based , or that Americans ’ voting decisions are rooted in facts .\nReporting by journalists scores slightly better with the public , but not by much : the survey found that only about 2 in 10 Americans believe media reporting is often or always based on facts . Roughly half of Americans think reporting is sometimes based on fact , while about a third say journalists never rely on facts .\nCoupled with a finding from the same survey that found many Americans have trouble verifying for themselves whether information is true , the poll paints a picture of a country deeply insecure about separating truth from falsehood .\n“ Lately , it seems like there ’ s been a war versus facts and reality , ” said Skye Hamm-Oliver , a 44-year-old Democrat in Lewiston , Idaho .\nWill Barger , a 32-year-old police officer in rural Missouri , has become increasingly skeptical of the media and voters alike in the past few years . A Republican and former regular viewer of Fox News who voted for President Donald Trump in 2016 , he ’ s become disillusioned with the president and the conservative cable channel and now trusts only local media .\nHe ’ s even less trusting in government and policy decisions , keeping his faith mainly in law-enforcement agencies . And he ’ s skeptical most voters are fact-driven .\n“ It ’ s more of a gut decision based on personal belief on a candidate , ” Barger said . What matters to most , he said , is “ if there ’ s an R in front of the name or a D in front of the name . ”\nOverall , 53 % of the public thinks voters sometimes cast ballots based on facts , while 32 % say they rarely or never do . Hamm-Oliver said voters in her home state of Idaho did so when they voted to approve a ballot measure last year that forced the state to accept the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act , which had previously been rejected by the state ’ s Republican-controlled legislature .\n“ But I have friends who ’ ve gone to vote and said ‘ just because that ’ s a fact , that isn ’ t all there is , ’ ” she said .\nJoan McKee , a 65-year-old insurance broker who lives on the southern New Jersey shore and leans Democratic , said she thinks most decisions involving policy and elections rely only slightly more — at best — on fact than opinion . She says even the public policies of people she supports , including former President Barack Obama , were partly based on ideology over facts .\n“ They may take the facts and spin them to do whatever they want , ” said McKee , arguing there are always choices in policy that are made based on core values . “ I think it ’ s pretty much always been like this . ”\nMcKee ’ s view is widespread , with 55 % of Americans saying policy decisions are sometimes based on fact while 3 in 10 think they rarely are . Republicans are more skeptical than Democrats that public policy is even sometimes fact-driven , with 33 % saying it rarely or never is compared to 23 % of Democrats .\n“ If government decision makers aren ’ t looking at government data , then our whole process is flawed , ” said former Microsoft chief executive and USAFacts founder Steve Ballmer . “ You have to look at the data that you have . ”\nThe poll also found a slim majority of Americans , including Republicans and Democrats , saying the president has a lot of sway over information the government provides .\nColleen Michaels thinks facts have nothing to do with policy . “ It ’ s emotional , ” the 55-year-old Ohio farmer , who leans Republican , said of policy . “ It has nothing to do with facts . ”\nShe cited restrictions on the slaughter of horses to protect against the unauthorized sale of horsemeat . Michaels is mainly a dairy farmer , but she raises draft horses and occasionally would like to kill one and sell it to overseas meat markets . But she ’ s no longer able to so easily thanks to regulations she considers based on animal-rights hysteria instead of facts .\nMichaels also has a jaundiced view of the media based on a personal experience . When she was young , she said , a news outlet falsely reported that a family member shot at some nearby campers . “ The media just goes by whatever they want to say , ” she said .\nViews on the factual nature of news media reporting are especially partisan . While 31 % of Democrats say reporting is reliably based in fact , just 10 % of Republicans say the same . Among Democrats , another 53 % say reporting is sometimes fact-based . By contrast , nearly half of Republicans , 46 % , think this is rare .\nHamm-Oliver , the Democrat from Idaho , trusts CNN but not Fox News . She worries , however , that media outlets are increasingly relying on opinion over facts and that those circulate wider among the public .\nOf fact and opinion pieces , she said : “ They ’ re starting to blend together . ”\nThe AP-NORC/USAFacts poll of 1,032 adults was conducted Oct. 15-28 using a sample drawn from NORC ’ s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel , which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population . The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.2 percentage points .

The unprecedented national effort to shut down much of daily life to slow the spread of COVID-19 is prompting a growing number of protests . ( Joshua A. Bickel/The Columbus Dispatch via AP , File )\nWhile many Americans are filled with fear , Melissa Ackison says the coronavirus pandemic has filled her with anger . The stay-at-home orders are government overreach , the conservative Ohio state Senate candidate says , and the labeling of some workers as “ essential ” arbitrary .\n“ It enrages something inside of you , ” said Ackison , who was among those who protested Republican Gov . Mike DeWine ’ s orders at the statehouse in Columbus with her 10-year-old son . She has “ no fear whatsoever ” of contracting the virus , she said Thursday , dismissing it as hype .\nThe Ohio protest was among a growing number staged outside governors ’ mansions and state Capitols across the country . In places like Oklahoma , Texas and Virginia , small-government groups , supporters of President Donald Trump , anti-vaccine advocates , gun rights backers and supporters of right-wing causes have united behind a deep suspicion of efforts to shut down daily life to slow the spread of the coronavirus . As their frustration with life under lockdown grows , they ’ ve started to openly defy the social distancing rules in an effort to put pressure on governors to ease them .\nSome of the protests have been small events , promoted via Facebook groups that have popped up in recent days and whose organizers are sometimes difficult to identify . Others are backed by groups funded by prominent Republican donors , some with ties to Trump . The largest so far , a rally of thousands that jammed the streets of Lansing , Michigan , on Wednesday , looked much like one of the president ’ s rallies — complete with MAGA hats or Trump flags — or one of the tea party rallies from a decade ago .\nThe signs of frustration come as Trump has pushed for easing stay-at-home orders and tried to look ahead to restarting the economy . He unveiled a framework for governors to follow on Thursday , but acknowledged the governors will have the final say on when their state is ready . Health experts have warned that lifting restrictions too quickly could result in a surge of new cases of the virus .\nBut the president and some of his supporters are impatient . Thousands of people in their cars packed the streets of Lansing to protest Democratic Gov . Gretchen Whitmer ’ s stay-at-home order and other restrictions . Outside the Capitol , some chanted “ Lock her up , ” a throwback to Trump ’ s calls during the 2016 election about his rival Hillary Clinton . One woman held a sign reading “ Heil Witmer . ”\nAsked about the protesters , Trump on Thursday expressed sympathy with their frustration — “ They ’ re suffering ... they want to get back ” — and dismissed concerns about the health risks of ignoring state orders and potentially exposing themselves to the virus .\n“ I think they ’ re listening . I think they listen to me , ” he said . “ They seem to be protesters that like me and respect this opinion , and my opinion ’ s the same as just about all of the governors . Nobody wants to stay shut . ”\nOn Friday , he egged the protesters on , tweeting for supporters to “ LIBERATE ” three states with Democratic governors : Michigan , Virginia and Minnesota , where a an afternoon protest was being held outside the governor ’ s residence .\nPolls show the protesters ’ views are not widely held . An AP-NORC survey earlier this month found large majorities of Americans support a long list of government restrictions , including closing schools , limiting gatherings and shuttering bars and restaurants . Three-quarters of Americans backed requiring people to stay in their homes . And majorities of both Democrats and Republicans gave high marks for the state and city governments .\nBut the protests expose resilient partisan divisions , particularly in battleground Michigan . The protest there was organized by the Michigan Conservative Coalition , a group founded by a pro-Trump state representative and his wife , Meshawn Maddock , who is on the advisory board for an official Trump campaign group called “ Women for Trump ” and is also the co-founder of Michigan Trump Republicans .\nAnother group that promoted the event , the Michigan Freedom Fund , is run by Greg McNeilly , a longtime political adviser to the DeVos family , who are prolific Republican donors and have funded conservative causes across the state for decades . McNeilly was campaign manager for Dick DeVos , the husband of current U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos , during his failed bid for governor in 2006 .\nWhitmer was among the governors who expressed concern about the gatherings , saying it put people at risk and could have prolonged the shutdown . Michigan had recorded over 2,000 deaths from COVID-19 as of Thursday , and close to 30,000 confirmed cases of people infected with the virus . Roughly one-quarter of the state ’ s workforce has filed for unemployment .\nBut it ’ s not just Democratic governors feeling the heat . A procession of cars swarmed around the Republican-dominated statehouse in Oklahoma City on Wednesday , with messages written on windows or signs that said “ stop killing our economy , ” “ we need our church ” and “ time 2 work . ”\nCarol Hefner , who previously served as an Oklahoma co-chair of Trump ’ s 2016 campaign , was a major organizer of the event . She differentiated it from many of the others , characterizing it as a “ rally ” rather than a protest .\n“ We ’ re not New York . Their problems are not our problems , ” Hefner said . “ We are rallying around our governor and our state to encourage the opening up of our businesses and the restoration of our state in a timely fashion . ”\nOther gatherings have links to fringe groups . A protest Thursday in the Texas capital of Austin , where protesters chanted “ Free Texas ” and “ Make America Free Again , ” was broadcast live by InfoWars TV , part of a company owned by conspiracy theorist and radio host Alex Jones .\nThe Ohio event earlier this week brought together a collection of anti-vaccine advocates , Second Amendment supporters , tea party activists and other anti-government activists . A Columbus Dispatch photo of Ackison and other protesters yelling through glass doors of the statehouse rocketed around the internet .\nAckison said that while she views DeWine ’ s efforts as constitutional overreach , she would be fine if Trump were to act with similar authority to force governors to bring the states back on line .\n“ As patriots , we put President Trump in office for a reason , ” she said . “ If he ’ s not able to give a convincing enough argument to these governors that they need to open up , then he needs to do something to take action . ”\nThe protests were advertised on Facebook by groups such as Reopen Virginia and End the Lockdown PA. A protest in Richmond , Virginia , on Thursday grew out of a conversation in the Facebook group Virginians for Medical Freedom , organizer Gary Golden said . The group often turns out at the Capitol in Richmond to oppose vaccine-related measures . Golden said Friday that he ’ s concerned about a loss of civil liberties , and isn ’ t swayed by what Trump says or tweets , adding , “ Politics has nothing to do with it . ”\nKelly Mullin said she brought her sons to the event to teach them a lesson about liberty . Mullin said that she thought the risk posed by the coronavirus depends on an individual ’ s health and that people can take basic steps to protect themselves , including getting enough sleep , eating organic produce and getting outside .\n“ I mean , that ’ s where our tax dollars should be going . Eat broccoli , ” she said .\nInfectious-disease specialists say there is no evidence that eating specific foods can prevent or kill the virus . Most people with the coronavirus experience mild or moderate symptoms , and people with health issues such as asthma and older people are at greater risk of death from COVID-19 . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

The justices won ’ t hear arguments until the winter . A decision is likely to come by the end of June . ( AP Photo/J . Scott Applewhite )\nWASHINGTON ( AP ) — The Supreme Court agreed Friday to plunge into the abortion debate in the midst of the 2020 presidential campaign , taking on a Louisiana case that could reveal how willing the more conservative court is to chip away at abortion rights .\nThe justices will examine a Louisiana law requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital . The law is virtually identical to one in Texas that the Supreme Court struck down in 2016 , when Justice Anthony Kennedy was on the bench and before the addition of President Donald Trump ’ s two high court picks , Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh , who have shifted the court to the right .\nThe court ’ s new term begins Monday , but arguments in the Louisiana case won ’ t take place until the winter . A decision is likely to come by the end of June , four months before the presidential election .\nThe Supreme Court temporarily blocked the Louisiana law from taking effect in February , when Chief Justice John Roberts joined the court ’ s four liberal justices to put it on hold . Kavanaugh and Gorsuch were among the four conservatives who would have allowed the law to take effect .\nThose preliminary votes do not bind the justices when they undertake a thorough review of an issue , but they often signal how a case will come out .\nRoberts ’ vote to block the Louisiana law was a rare vote against an abortion restriction in his more than 13 years as chief justice . That may reflect his new role since Kennedy ’ s retirement as the court ’ s swing justice , his concern about the court being perceived as a partisan institution and respect for a prior decision of the court , even one he disagreed with .\nIn the Texas case , he voted in dissent to uphold the admitting privileges requirement .\nThe Louisiana case and a separate appeal over an Indiana ultrasound requirement for women seeking an abortion , on which the court took no action Friday , were the most significant of hundreds of pending appeals the justices considered when they met in private on Tuesday .\nBoth cases involve the standard first laid out by the court in 1992 that while states can regulate abortion , they can ’ t do things that place an “ undue burden ” on a woman ’ s right to an abortion .

    "148": "WASHINGTON ( AP ) — A political advocacy group founded by Bernie Sanders entered into a nondisclosure agreement with an African American political consultant that bars her from discussing a lawsuit alleging racial discrimination at the organization and the Vermont senator ’ s 2016 presidential campaign .\nThe consultant , Tezlyn Figaro , confirmed the existence of the nondisclosure agreement to The ███ without providing additional details .\nThe deal is tied to a 2019 lawsuit in which Figaro said she was fired from the Sanders-created political group Our Revolution a year earlier due to her race and in “ retaliation for complaining about the organization ’ s treatment towards her and African-Americans. ” The lawsuit was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount of money . Though the lawsuit was aimed at Our Revolution , it included broad criticism of Sanders ’ campaign , arguing an all-white leadership staff “ was accused of racism ” by black staffers and failed to engage black voters .\nNondisclosure agreements , or NDAs , have become common in presidential campaigns and political organizations in recent years as tools to guard against the release of private data , strategic conversations or other proprietary information . But such deals have become increasingly controversial as people alleging that they ’ re victims of sexual harassment and misconduct or , in Figaro ’ s case , racial discrimination have said they ’ re prevented from publicly sharing their stories .\nBillionaire Mike Bloomberg , one of Sanders ’ Democratic presidential race rivals , has faced criticism for the use of nondisclosure agreements at his company in cases related to sexual harassment . The former New York mayor has said he ’ s willing to release three women from nondisclosure agreements related to comments he was accused of making in the past .\nSanders has acknowledged the mistreatment of women and minorities who worked on his 2016 campaign , and his advisers say they ’ ve taken corrective measures for his second run . Now the front-runner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination , Sanders frequently says he is building a “ multiracial , multi-generational movement ” that will appeal to the broad coalition needed to win the primary and defeat President Donald Trump .\nBut legal experts say that argument could be undermined by a nondisclosure agreement that prevents a woman of color who has criticized Sanders ’ record on race from talking about her experience .\n“ Anyone running for the presidency should be accountable to the electorate , and we should have access to the full set of information , ” said Debra S. Katz , a prominent employment attorney in Washington who has donated to Elizabeth Warren ’ s campaign . “ If the allegations are about his campaign and running a racist operation , he should direct this organization to let her out of those non-disparagement obligations and talk about it . ”\nFigaro was the director of racial justice for Sanders ’ 2016 campaign , then worked on black outreach issues for Our Revolution . According to federal court records , her case against Our Revolution was settled in July 2019 for an undisclosed amount .\nFigaro confirmed the existence of the NDA but declined to comment further . Her attorney , Anthony J . Hall , said he could not comment on the terms of the settlement .\nA spokesman for Our Revolution did not respond to multiple requests for comment . The Sanders campaign said it couldn ’ t comment on the specifics of the case , arguing the campaign can ’ t legally have insight into the activities of Our Revolution .\nIn a statement , Sanders campaign spokeswoman Sarah Ford said , “ We oppose using NDAs to silence the victims of toxic workplace issues . ”\nAfter his effort to win the 2016 Democratic nomination failed , Sanders founded Our Revolution to keep up the momentum from the campaign . The group has employed current and former Sanders presidential staffers but operates independently from his campaign , though it has raised millions of dollars to support his current bid .\nShe was brought on by former Our Revolution President Nina Turner , a top Sanders surrogate who is now national co-chair of his 2020 campaign . When Turner tried to make Figaro Our Revolution ’ s chief of staff , board members objected .\nPast comments Figaro made about immigration on Twitter and as a pundit on Fox News quickly surfaced and drew rebuke , with critics and some Our Revolution staffers saying that they were anti-immigrant .\n“ If AMERICAN black folks can go to jail when they break the law then certainly so can an illegal immigrant , ” she said in one tweet .\n“ U r being distracted abt ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS meanwhile more blacks are under prison/parole control in in 2010 than were enslaved in 1850 , ” she wrote in another .\nFigaro , who had long worked as a consultant to Turner , publicly apologized but was fired . Our Revolution was aware of her past comments when she was hired , according to her lawsuit . Turner didn ’ t respond to a request for comment .\nIn the past , Figaro defended herself by noting that her comments echoed what Sanders has previously said .\n“ If poverty is increasing and if wages are going down , I don ’ t know why we need millions of people to be coming into this country as guest workers who will work for lower wages than American workers and drive wages down even lower than they are now , ” Sanders said in a 2007 television interview explaining why he opposed a bipartisan immigration bill .\nSanders ’ campaign says its key to victory in the 2020 Democratic primary and general election is to dramatically grow the electorate , appealing to working-class Americans and minorities who have often felt disillusioned with the political system .\nSanders ’ campaign manager , Faiz Shakir , is the first Muslim American to lead a presidential campaign . Sanders likens his movement to the civil rights struggle , and he often mentions his own activist past , including getting arrested during protests decrying racism while at the University of Chicago in the 1960s . He has worked hard to woo minority groups , which has energized many young voters .\nBut in 2016 , black staffers who were hired by Sanders to conduct African American outreach say the campaign did not take them seriously . Minority staffers said they were sent to do other tasks , like driving people around , instead of courting the black voters Sanders said he wanted to win .\n“ People will say it ’ s not a racial issue , ” said John Solomon , who was based in Atlanta for the 2016 campaign and said he was sometimes assigned responsibilities that were outside of his job description . “ But if I ’ m hired to gain support from African Americans and you go direct me to do something other than reach out to the African American community , what are we doing ? ”\nAfter the black outreach team booked several successful events , including a rally at historically black Morehouse College in Atlanta , resources dwindled and black outreach staffers say Sanders ’ campaign began brushing them off .\nHis campaign has acknowledged Sanders ’ past failings and said it is trying to right them now .\nSanders has invested heavily in Spanish-language television advertising and organized dozens of events meant to appeal to Hispanic voters , including soccer tournaments for volunteers in Iowa and Texas and a town hall in Spanish led by New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in Nevada . His backers affectionately call him “ Tio ” ( Uncle ) Bernie .\nHis campaign says that outreach helped him appeal to minorities who participated in satellite caucuses in Iowa and drove his win in Nevada decisively last weekend . He has said he can win Saturday ’ s Democratic primary in South Carolina , where the support of black voters is crucial .\nBut Solomon said the existence of Figaro ’ s nondisclosure agreement reinforces his experience on the 2016 campaign .\n“ I know he wants to move past this , but I feel that he still has some work to do , ” Solomon said .\nCatch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast , “ Ground Game . ” \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

His nephew Khizar Shahzad says Mr Choudry 's daughter had called for a non-emergency ambulance on Saturday because her father was having an `` episode '' . Once paramedics arrived at his apartment in Malton , outside of Toronto , Mr Shahzad said they saw he had a knife and called the police .\nFamily recalled pleading with police to be allowed to go with them into the building to make Mr Choudry more comfortable , explaining that he was likely to be paranoid .\n`` I said , 'Hey , he 's scared of your uniform , he 's not scared of you , ' '' Mr Shahzad recalled .\nIn a news release , the SIU said Peel Regional Police arrived at 5pm local time , and that they communicated with Mr Choudry , who was barricaded in his apartment .\n`` Shortly after communication stopped , officers breached the door and entered the unit . An interaction occurred which included officers deploying a conducted energy weapon at the man , as well as firing plastic projectiles , '' said the SIU in its press release .\n`` When these had no effect , an officer discharged a firearm and the man was struck .

There is blood on their hands and the officer who pulled the trigger should never be trusted with a gun or badge again , '' said Mohammed Hashim , who is on the board of the Urban Alliance .\nThe SIU , which investigates all civilian deaths that occur during interactions with police , is currently investigating both Mr Choudry 's death and the death of Ms Korchinski-Paquet .\nBut many have doubted the police watchdog 's ability to deliver justice . Ms Korchinski-Paquet 's family delayed their interview with the SIU over concerns the investigation was compromised after they allege police leaked details of her death to the media .\nThe Muslim Council of Peel is calling for an independent inquiry unconnected to the SIU , and a review of police use of force during mental-health checks . Mr Choudry was originally from Pakistan .\n`` I am heartbroken for the family , '' the council 's executive director Rabia Khedr said in a statement .\n`` Police are trained to catch criminals and shoot to kill .

In Virginia ’ s capital city , the school board approved a plan that reassigned some students but rejected more sweeping proposals that would have diversified Richmond ’ s whitest elementary schools . ( AP Photo/Steve Helber )\nELLICOTT CITY , Md . ( AP ) — As they try to address stubborn school segregation , many of the nation ’ s school districts confront a familiar obstacle : resistance from affluent , well-organized and mostly white parents to changes affecting their children ’ s classrooms .\nFrom New York City to Richmond , Virginia , sweeping proposals to ease inequities have been scaled back or canceled after encountering a backlash . The debates have been charged with emotion and racist rhetoric reminiscent of the aftermath of Brown vs. Board of Education , the U.S. Supreme Court decision that threw out state laws establishing segregated schools .\nWhile the federal government has largely stepped back from the aggressive role it played decades ago in school desegregation , some local districts have acted in recognition of increasingly apparent racial divides and the long-established educational benefits of integration .\nIn Howard County , Maryland , a suburban community between Washington and Baltimore , one parent who supports reforms lamented the presence of “ concentrated poverty in certain schools and concentrated wealth in other schools . ”\n“ When we have concentrated poverty , those students are not getting that same quality of education , ” said Dawn Popp , a white mother of two students in local schools .\nThe Supreme Court has ruled that race can not be used as the driving factor in assigning students to public schools . But more than 100 school districts have implemented voluntary desegregation plans that work around that ruling by mixing students from families with different incomes or educational levels , factors often associated with race , according to Richard Kahlenberg , a senior fellow at the Century Foundation in Washington .\nThe success of such efforts can depend on the size of the coalition seeking change and how well the goals are communicated . The most important task for school officials is “ to explain to the public why integrated schools are good for everyone , ” Kahlenberg said .\nRace and class divisions were on display for months last year after the Howard County school board directed the superintendent to start a comprehensive redistricting process . The Howard County Council in August requested that the blueprint address socioeconomic and racial segregation across the school system , which serves about 59,000 children , the majority of whom are minorities . Most low-income students are black and Hispanic .\nThe superintendent originally proposed moving some 7,400 students to different schools . The overwhelming opposition was led by white and Asian families , who protested near an area mall and flooded public meetings .\nThey carried signs that read “ Kids before politics , ” “ Swapping kids creates new inequities ” and “ No forced busing. ” Speakers at public meetings said the changes would cause stress and anxiety for their children . One suggested the transfers could lead students to consider suicide .\nOpponents insisted the issue was not about race and sought to distance themselves from racist feedback submitted in writing .\nGeorge Henry , a retiree living in Ellicott City , wrote in a newspaper op-ed that his children , now in their 30s , received good educations in the local schools , with highly diverse classmates . He said the “ artificial and forced mixing ” is unnecessary . He told The ███ the “ fundamental factor ” to closing the achievement gap is the support students have at home , which is not up to the county .\nIn November , the Howard County Board of Education approved reassigning some 5,400 students , not including two particular high schools — River Hill High and Wilde Lake High , where less than 5 % and more than 45 % of students , respectively , are from low-income families . Parents of students at River Hill High had been among the most outspoken protesters .\nSome parents are now challenging the plan in court . Others would have preferred to see more ambitious changes .\nPopp said the scaled-back redistricting sends a message that “ people who can afford the matching T-shirts and the fancy signs ” and have time to organize can get their way .\nCynthia Fikes , whose son attends Wilde Lake High , said the redistricting debate revealed the “ level of fear and disdain ” that much of the community had for people unlike themselves . She said racist and classist statements were “ allowed to pass as conversations ” at meetings and on social media .\n“ When you look at what was said , it ’ s so hurtful , ” said Fikes , who is black .\nIn Virginia ’ s capital city , the school board approved a plan that reassigned some students but rejected more sweeping proposals that would have diversified Richmond ’ s whitest elementary schools .\nThe former capital of the Confederacy is about 47 percent white , but only about 14 percent of its public school students are . And of those white students , many are concentrated in just a handful of schools .\nThe push to integrate some of those most segregated schools was included in last year ’ s rezoning process , which also aimed to ease overcrowding and fill new school buildings . The most controversial proposals involved pairing , a process in which students from the whitest elementary schools would have been pooled together with students from majority-black schools and then split up by grade level .\nIn an emotional public debate that stretched for months , supporters called pairing a bold way to help disadvantaged students and create more unified and diverse communities .\nBut those supporters were often outnumbered by opponents , with parents and property owners raising concerns about home values . Some said it would strain families with children split between multiple schools , limiting what time parents could spend volunteering with a PTA or complicating pickups and drop-offs . Others threatened that it would trigger another exodus to the suburbs or to private schools .\nAt one forum , Taikein Cooper said the coded racist language was “ so loud I had to pinch myself . ”\n“ We can all agree that the schools are not equal right now , ” said Cooper , the executive director of an education advocacy organization . “ They ’ re not the same . That ’ s why some people behind me are fighting so adamantly to protect their own privilege . ”\nSuperintendent Jason Kamras , who was hired in 2017 and pledged to reform the district with the state ’ s lowest graduation rate , supported pairing . In a tweet , he likened the criticism of one option to “ Massive Resistance 2.0 , ” a reference to the anti-segregation movement that followed the Supreme Court ’ s landmark Brown decision .\n“ I heard a lot of things said during these meetings which sounded almost verbatim like the things that were said in the ’ 50s and ’ 60s and ’ 70s to prevent the integration of schools in Richmond and around the country , ” he said in an interview .\nBut pairing was also unpopular among many black families . School board member Kenya Gibson addressed the crowd at a community forum where a diverse group of parents overwhelmingly opposed the plan , saying she recognized that “ many of the people of color in this room have a lot of the same unease as the white people have in this room . ”\nIn December , the board enacted a plan that did not include pairing , although it redrew lines in parts of the city in ways that will make some schools more diverse .\nTheresa Kennedy , a white mother of two elementary school students who served on the advisory committee that created the rezoning options , was a vocal advocate of pairing . She was disappointed .\n“ These votes don ’ t come along often , ” Kennedy said . “ And every vote like this has the opportunity to shift a generation . ” \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

United United Airlines will send layoff warnings to 36,000 employees - nearly half its U.S. staff - in the clearest signal yet of how deeply the virus outbreak is hurting the airline industry . United officials said Wednesday , July 8 that they still hope to limit the number of layoffs by offering early retirement , but they have to send notices this month to comply with a law requiring that workers get 60 days ' notice ahead of mass job cuts . ( AP Photo/Chris O'Meara , File )\nWASHINGTON ( AP ) — The U.S. economy is stumbling as the viral outbreak intensifies , threatening to slow hiring and deepening the uncertainty for employees , consumers and companies across the country .\nCoronavirus case counts are rising in 38 states , and the nation as a whole has been shattering single-day records for new confirmed cases . In six states representing one-third of the economy — Arizona , California , Colorado , Florida , Michigan , and Texas — governors are reversing their reopening plans . Reopening efforts are on pause in 15 other states .\nThe reversals are keeping layoffs elevated and threatening to weaken hiring . More than 1.3 million people applied for unemployment benefits last week , the Labor Department said Thursday , down from 1.4 million the previous week but still roughly double the pre-pandemic weekly record . Applications had fallen steadily in April and May but have barely declined in the past month .\nJobless claims “ are stalled out at a new normal of over a million new claims every week , ” said Daniel Zhao , an economist at Glassdoor . “ The virus is in the driver ’ s seat and we ’ re along for the ride until the current public health crisis is resolved . ”\nSome economists have even warned that a so-called “ double-dip ” recession , in which the economy shrinks again after rebounding , could develop . Consumers , the primary driver of U.S. economic growth , are pulling back on spending in restaurants and bars , especially in the hardest-hit states . Some small businesses are closing , either under government orders or because of a lack of customers , according to private data .\nSeveral companies have warned in recent days that more layoffs are coming . Levi ’ s , the iconic jeans maker , said it will cut 700 corporate jobs . United Airlines has warned 36,000 of its employees — nearly half its workforce — that they could lose their jobs in October . ( Airlines aren ’ t allowed to cut jobs until then as a condition of accepting billions of dollars in government rescue aid . ) Motorcycle maker Harley Davidson said it will eliminate 700 corporate jobs .\nThe pandemic drove Walgreens to a deep loss in the most recent quarter , with customers staying home or limiting shopping to essential supplies from grocery stores . Walgreens will cut 4,000 jobs at its pharmacy chain Boots in the United Kingdom . Bed Bath & Beyond said it will close 200 stores over the next two years as its sales have slid .\nThe uncertainty fanned by the pandemic has led many CEOs to abandon their forecasts for second-quarter results . Just as with the economy , forecasters say it could take years for corporate earnings to return to the levels they were at before the pandemic .\nWith reported viral cases surging , restaurant visits are falling in Arizona , California , Florida , and Texas , which together account for half of new confirmed infections . This week , in Arizona , restaurant traffic was down 65 % from a year earlier , worse than the 50 % year-over-year drop two weeks earlier , according to data from reservation app OpenTable . In Florida , traffic was down 57 % , compared with 45 % two weeks before .\nLast week , applications for U.S. unemployment benefits spiked in Texas , Nevada , Tennessee and Louisiana — states where confirmed cases of the virus are intensifying . They also jumped in New Jersey and New York , where the pandemic is mostly under control , but where reopening steps have been postponed .\nApplications dropped in California and Florida , though in California they remained high , with more than 267,000 claims . That is more people than were applying each week for unemployment benefits in the entire country before the pandemic hit . Jobless claims also declined in Michigan and Colorado .\nThe total number of people receiving jobless benefits fell 700,000 to 18 million . That suggests that some companies are continuing to rehire a limited number of workers . An additional 1 million people sought benefits last week under a separate program for self-employed and gig workers that has made them eligible for aid for the first time . These figures aren ’ t adjusted for seasonal variations , so the government doesn ’ t include them in the official count .\nIn New Jersey , about 4,000 people had expected to return to their jobs last week at casinos in Atlantic City , after Gov . Phil Murphy said they could fully reopen . But Murphy later said the casinos couldn ’ t reopen their restaurants and bars because indoor dining was too risky . Employees who had hoped to return to work feel whipsawed .\n“ I wanted this nightmare to go away , ” said Mineli Polanco , a beverage server at Borgata , a hotel and casino . “ That first call was such a relief : things were going back to normal . Then the second call came , and it was a new nightmare . ”\nSigns of a weakening jobs picture suggest a turnaround from last week ’ s jobs report for June , which showed a solid gain of 4.8 million jobs and an unemployment rate that fell to 11.1 % from 13.3 % . But the June jobs report reflected surveys of Americans that were conducted in the middle of that month — before the pandemic flared up again . And even counting that hiring gain , the economy has regained only about one-third of the jobs that vanished in March and April .\nCredit card data from both Bank of America and J.P.Morgan Chase show that spending has slipped in the past two weeks , even in states that don ’ t have sharp outbreaks .\n“ This suggests that renewed fears about the virus , rather than government restrictions , are driving the pullback in activity , ” said Andrew Hunter , senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics , a forecasting firm .\nAmong retailers , the number of shifts worked changed little last week after steady increases in previous weeks , according to data from Kronos , which makes scheduling software . David Gilbertson , a vice president at Kronos , said this indicates that consumer demand in many cases hasn ’ t picked up enough to justify more employees .\n“ Everything that ’ s going to be open is open , ” Gilbertson said . “ Now , we just need more people to come in and start spending money before things can pick up again . ”\nThe renewed threat of job losses is arising just as a federal program that provides $ 600 a week in unemployment benefits , on top of whatever jobless aid each state provides , is to expire at the end of this month . Congressional leaders have said they will take up some form of a new rescue package when lawmakers return later this month from a recess .\nAdministration officials have expressed support for additional stimulus . But Senate Republicans have opposed extending the $ 600 a week in unemployment benefits , mainly on the ground that it discourages laid-off people from returning to work . House Democrats have pushed to extend the $ 600 a week through January .\nIn an interview Thursday on CNBC , Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin suggested that the administration might support an extension of supplemental unemployment aid but at a reduced level .\n“ We ’ re going to make sure people are ( incentivized ) to go back to jobs , ” Mnuchin said . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

It ’ s not my thing , ” Trump said .\nAssange gave a thumbs up in handcuffs as he was taken from a police station to a London court , where he pronounced himself not guilty of failing to surrender in 2012 .\nJudge Michael Snow called Assange , wearing a black jacket and black shirt , a “ narcissist who can not get beyond his own selfish interests ” and convicted him of skipping bail . Sentencing will be at a later date .\nPolice said they arrested Assange , 47 , after being invited into the embassy following Ecuador ’ s withdrawal of asylum . He took refuge there in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden over a sexual assault investigation that was later dropped .\nAssange was carried out of the building - located behind the luxury department store Harrods - carrying a copy of Gore Vidal ’ s “ History of The National Security State ” , which he continued reading in court .\nIn Washington , the U.S. Justice Department said Assange was charged with conspiring with former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to gain access to a government computer as part of a 2010 leak by WikiLeaks of hundreds of thousands of U.S. military reports about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and American diplomatic communications . Legal experts said more U.S. charges could be coming .\nThe indictment was made secretly in March 2018 and unsealed on Thursday . He faces up to five years in prison if convicted , with legal experts saying more charges were possible .\nEcuador suspended Julian Assange ’ s citizenship and accused him and others at WikiLeaks of collaborating in attempts to destabilize the Andean nation ’ s government .\nAssange was offered refuge in 2012 by Ecuador ’ s then-president Rafael Correa , but his relationship with Ecuador soured under Correa ’ s successor Lenin Moreno , who has said Assange violated the terms of his asylum . Ecuador accused Assange of leaking information about Moreno ’ s personal life .\nLawyers for Assange said he may risk torture and his life would be in danger if he were to be extradited to the United States .\nThe arrest , after years holed up in a few cramped rooms at the embassy , represented one of the most sensational turns in a tumultuous life that has transformed the computer programmer into a fugitive wanted by the United States .\n“ The whole House will welcome the news this morning that the Metropolitan Police have arrested Julian Assange , arrested for breach of bail after nearly seven years in the Ecuadorean embassy , ” May said .\nEcuador ’ s foreign minister said his country was not aware of any active extradition requests for Assange before it terminated his asylum .

His detractors have painted him as a dangerous figure complicit in Russian efforts to undermine the West and U.S. security , and dispute that he is a journalist .\n“ Under the guise of transparency , Julian Assange and WikiLeaks have effectively acted as an arm of the Russian intelligence services for years , ” U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr , a Republican , said . “ Hopefully , he will now face justice . ”\nThe Kremlin said it hoped Assange ’ s rights would not be violated .\nWikiLeaks angered Washington by publishing hundreds of thousands of secret U.S. diplomatic cables that laid bare critical U.S. appraisals of world leaders , from Russian President Vladimir Putin to members of the Saudi royal family .\nWikiLeaks founder Julian Assange arrives at the Westminster Magistrates Court , after he was arrested in London , Britain April 11 , 2019 . ███/Hannah McKay TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY\nAssange made international headlines in 2010 when WikiLeaks published a classified U.S. military video showing a 2007 attack by Apache helicopters in Baghdad that killed a dozen people , including two ███ news staff .\nAssange ’ s U.S. indictment arose from a long-running criminal investigation dating back to the administration of former President Barack Obama . It was triggered in part by WikiLeaks ’ publication in 2010 of U.S. military reports about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the diplomatic communications - disclosures that embarrassed the United States and strained relations with allies .\nThe Justice Department said Assange was arrested under an extradition treaty between the United States and Britain .\nThe indictment said Assange in March 2010 engaged in a conspiracy to assist Manning , formerly named Bradley Manning , in cracking a password stored on U.S. Department of Defense computers connected to a U.S. government network used for classified documents and communications .\nManning ’ s lawyers demanded the release of the former intelligence analyst , jailed last month after being held in contempt by a judge in Virginia for refusing to testify before a grand jury , and said “ continued detention would be purely punitive . ”\nA Swedish lawyer representing the alleged rape victim said she would push to have prosecutors reopen the case , but a retired senior prosecutor and chairman of NGO Victim Support Sweden said that may be difficult .\n“ Julian Assange is no hero , he has hidden from the truth for years and years , ” British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said .\n“ It ’ s not so much Julian Assange being held hostage in the Ecuadorean embassy , it ’ s actually Julian Assange holding the Ecuadorean embassy hostage in a situation that was absolutely intolerable for them . ”\nFriends of Assange said his solitary existence in the embassy was tough on him .\n“ It was a miserable existence and I could see it was a strain on him , but a strain he managed rather well , ” said Vaughan Smith , a friend who had visited Assange . “ The thing that was most difficult for Julian was the solitude . ”\n“ He was very tough , but the last year in particular was very difficult .

    "157": "Now that Hurricane Junior has blown through Washington , special counsel Robert Mueller - charged with investigating possible ties between Russia and the Trump presidential campaign - faces the task of sifting through the debris .\nAccording to CNN , the former FBI director and his team of crack investigators were caught somewhat flat-footed by the recent email revelations . They were believed to have been focusing their attention on former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn , son-in-law Jared Kushner and former campaign chair Paul Manafort , among others .\nAs it turns out , the first bit of concrete public evidence that someone in the president 's inner circle might be open to Russian assistance in the presidential election involved Mr Trump 's eldest son .\nThe president , Trump Jr and his administration have quickly reformed their defences and are now dismissing the meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya last June as a minor event during a hurly-burly political season , largely lost in the fog of time , that led to nothing and which they have been admirably `` transparent '' in discussing .\nKey members of Congress seem to think otherwise , with senators like Republican Susan Collins of Maine calling for Trump Jr to be questioned by the Senate Intelligence Committee , and Republican Chuck Grassley of Iowa eager to bring Manafort before his Senate Judiciary Committee .\nBut while Congress gears up for more hearings , Mr Mueller operates quietly behind the scenes . Where might he look first ? What threads , revealed in Trump Jr 's emails , will he and his team tug on , to see what unravels ?\nHere are a few of the tempting questions he might be tempted to ask .\nWhat else did Rob Goldstone think the Russian government was doing to help Mr Trump ?\nNestled toward the end of music publicist Goldstone 's explosive first email to Trump Jr about the `` official documents and information '' the Russian government supposedly had about Hillary Clinton was that this constituted just `` part of '' Russia 's support for his father , `` helped along by Aras and Emin '' Agalarov , the father-son Moscow-based real estate duo .\nIt 's a rather stunning detail for Goldstone to have offhandedly mentioned - and one that Trump Jr , in his `` love it '' response , seems to have breezed past with no comment .\nThat kind of remark , however , would cause anyone looking for evidence of a Trump-Russia campaign collusion to stop dead in their tracks and ask : `` What 's the rest of the story ? ''\nEven if one takes Veselnitskaya at her word that she is not an agent of the Russian government and did not know or provide any damaging information about Mrs Clinton to the Trump team during the 9 June meeting , her own recent admissions raise some pressing questions .\nOn Tuesday she told an NBC interviewer that Trump Jr , Manafort and Kushner may have been `` longing for '' the dirt on their Democratic opponent .\n`` They wanted it so badly that they could only hear the thought that they wanted , '' she said .\nIn other words , Veselnitskaya walked out of that meeting in New York with the belief that Mr Trump 's campaign both was desperately seeking damaging information about Mrs Clinton and were open to talking to Russian nationals about what they might have to offer .\nGiven that Veselnitskaya is at the very least a well-connected figure in Moscow , it does n't require a great leap of faith to think this information eventually made its way to the Russian government . If the US intelligence community is to be believed , that government soon would acquire a trove of damaging information about Mrs Clinton and the Democrats as a result of hacks it co-ordinated into the Democratic National Committee server and the personal email of a senior member of Mrs Clinton 's campaign team .\nIn the ensuing months , details from those hacks would be made public via Wikileaks at times that were particularly damaging to Mrs Clinton .\nDerogatory statements about Mrs Clinton 's Democratic opponent Bernie Sanders were produced the week before Democrats gathered for their national convention . Transcripts of Mrs Clinton 's paid speeches to Goldman Sachs were published just days before the final presidential debate - and cited during that showdown by Mr Trump himself .\nThe Trump campaign wanted dirt on Mrs Clinton . The Russian government had it in spades .

( AP Photo/Alex Brandon )\nBAGRAM AIR FIELD , Afghanistan ( AP ) — President Donald Trump paid a surprise Thanksgiving visit to Afghanistan , where he announced the U.S. and the Taliban have been engaged in ongoing peace talks and said he believes the Taliban want a cease-fire .\nTrump arrived at Bagram Air Field shortly after 8:30 p.m. local time Thursday and spent 3½ hours on the ground during his first trip to the site of America ’ s longest war . He served turkey and thanked the troops , delivered a speech and sat down with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani before leaving just after midnight . He arrived back in Florida , where he is spending the holiday weekend , early Friday morning local time .\nAs per tradition , reporters were under strict instructions to keep the trip a secret to ensure the president ’ s safety in Afghanistan . About 12,000 U.S. forces remain in the country .\nTraveling with Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming and a small clutch of aides , including his acting chief of staff , press secretary and national security adviser , Trump appeared in good spirits as he was escorted around the base by heavily armed soldiers , as the smell of burning fuel and garbage wafted through the chilly air . Unlike last year ’ s post-Christmas visit to Iraq — his first to an active combat zone — first lady Melania Trump did not make the trip .\nTrump ’ s first stop was a dining hall , where the crowd erupted into cheers when he arrived . There , he served turkey to soldiers dressed in fatigues and sat down for a meal . But he said he only tasted the mashed potatoes before he was pulled away for photos .\n“ I never got the turkey , ” he told the troops . “ A gorgeous piece of turkey . ”\nDuring his visit , Trump announced that the U.S. and Taliban have been engaged in peace talks and insisted the Taliban want to make a deal after heavy U.S. fire in recent months .\n“ We ’ re meeting with them , ” he said . “ And we ’ re saying it has to be a cease-fire . And they don ’ t want to do a cease-fire , but now they do want to do a cease-fire , I believe ... and we ’ ll see what happens . ”\nThe trip came after Trump abruptly broke off peace talks with the Taliban in September , canceling a secret meeting with Taliban and Afghan leaders at the Camp David presidential retreat after a particularly deadly spate of violence , capped by a bombing in Kabul that killed 12 people , including an American soldier .\nThat ended a nearly yearlong effort by the U.S. to reach a political settlement with the Taliban , the group that protected al-Qaida extremists in Afghanistan , prompting U.S. military action after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks . U.S. and international forces have been on the ground ever since .\nIt was not immediately clear how long or substantive the U.S. reengagement with the Taliban has been .\nTaliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said the Taliban ’ s stance is unchanged . He said the United States broke off talks and when it wants to resume the Taliban are ready .\nTrump ran his 2016 campaign promising to end the nation ’ s “ endless wars ” and has been pushing to withdraw troops from Afghanistan and in the Middle East despite protests from top U.S. officials , Trump ’ s Republican allies in Washington and many U.S. allies abroad . For months now , he has described American forces as “ policemen ” and argued that other countries ’ wars should be theirs to wage .\nTens of thousands of Afghan civilians and more than 2,400 American service members have been killed since the war began 18 years ago .\nJust last week , Trump flew to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to oversee the transfer of the remains of two Army officers killed when their helicopter crashed as they provided security for troops on the ground in Logar province in eastern Afghanistan . The Taliban still control or hold sway over about half of the country , staging near daily attacks targeting Afghan forces and government officials .\nThe U.S. and the Taliban in September had been close to an agreement that might have enabled a U.S. troop withdrawal .\nNonetheless , Trump said Thursday that he was proceeding with a plan to reduce U.S. troop levels to about 8,600 , telling reporters we ’ re “ bringing down the number of troops substantially . ”\nStill , he said , the U.S. will stay in the country “ until we have a deal or we have total victory . ”\nTrump made the announcement as he met with Ghani , the Afghan president . Ghani thanked the Americans who have made the “ ultimate sacrifice ” in Afghanistan and assured the president that Afghan security forces are increasingly leading the fight .\n“ In the next three months , it ’ s going to be all Afghanistan ! ” Ghani said .\nGhani also praised Trump for the October mission that killed Islamic State group leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi . The Afghan leader also indicated , as Trump himself has , that the al-Baghdadi mission was even more significant than the 2011 mission targeting al-Qaida founder Osama bin Laden . The bin Laden mission was ordered by then-President Barack Obama .\n“ President Trump , people talked a lot about bin Laden , but what you did to eliminate al-Baghdadi , who was an organizer and not a talker , is a much greater accomplishment , ” said Ghani , in remarks to U.S. troops before Trump ’ s departure .\nThe trip came a week after the Taliban freed an American and an Australian who had been held hostage since 2016 in exchange for three top Taliban figures , a move that has been widely seen as a possible entree to rekindling peace talks .\nThe White House took pains to keep the trip a secret after Trump ’ s cover was blown last year when Air Force One was spotted en route to Iraq by an amateur British flight watcher .\nCellphones and other transmitting devices were confiscated for most of the trip from everyone traveling aboard Air Force One . And Thanksgiving-themed tweets were teed up to publish ahead of time from Trump ’ s account to prevent suspicions arising about the president ’ s silence .\nA small group of reporters was told to meet Wednesday night on the top floor of a parking garage in Maryland and was transported in black vans to Andrews Air Force Base . Nobody would confirm where he was going . The only guidance : Dress casually and warmly . Meanwhile , the president was secretly flying back from Florida , where reporters had been told he ’ d be spending Thanksgiving at his Mar-a-Lago club .\nThe plane he ’ d flown to Florida — the modified 747 painted in the iconic white and blue of Air Force One — remained parked on the tarmac at the West Palm Beach airport to avoid revealing the president ’ s movement .\nAbout 9:45 p.m. Wednesday , the president boarded a nearly identical plane concealed in a hangar at Andrews Air Force Base , taking off and landing under the cover of darkness , with cabin lights dimmed and window shutters drawn .\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said plans for the visit had been in the works for weeks .\n“ It ’ s a dangerous area and he wants to support the troops , ” Grisham told reporters before Trump landed . “ He and Mrs. Trump recognize that there ’ s a lot of people who are away from their families during the holidays , and we thought it ’ d be a nice surprise . ”\nThe president told the troops he was honored to spend part of his holiday with them .\n“ There is nowhere I ’ d rather celebrate this Thanksgiving than right here with the toughest , strongest , best and bravest warriors on the face of the earth , ” Trump said . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

Protesters pulled the statue down with rope , cheering as it lay face down in the mud , its head and back covered in dirt .\nThe university system ’ s board chair , Harry Smith , and president , Margaret Spellings , denounced the toppling of the statue in a joint statement .\n“ The actions last evening were unacceptable , dangerous , and incomprehensible , ” they said . “ We are a nation of laws and mob rule and the intentional destruction of public property will not be tolerated . ”\nLast year UNC students threatened to sue the school , alleging that the university violated federal anti-discrimination laws by allowing the statue to remain on campus .\nNorth Carolina Governor Roy Cooper , a Democrat , said in a statement he shared protesters “ frustration ” over statues but condemned the violent destruction of public property .\nCampus police arrested at least one person at the protest for wearing a mask and resisting arrest , according to Audrey Smith , a university spokeswoman .\nThe efforts by civil rights groups and others to do away with Confederate monuments such as Silent Sam gained momentum three years ago after avowed white supremacist Dylann Roof murdered nine black people at a church in Charleston , South Carolina . The shooting rampage ultimately led to the removal of a Confederate flag from the statehouse in Columbia .\nSince then , more than 110 symbols of the Confederacy have been removed across the nation with more than 1,700 still standing , according to the Southern Poverty Law Center , a civil rights group .

Lee was vandalized and later removed by school officials last year at neighboring Duke University in Durham , North Carolina .\nMany Americans see such statues as symbols of racism and glorifications of the southern states ’ defense of slavery . Others view them as important symbols of American history .\nThe head of the United Daughters of the Confederacy said on Tuesday the group denounced hate groups and asked people to leave Confederate monuments alone .\n“ We are grieved that certain hate groups have taken the Confederate flag and other symbols as their own , ” the group ’ s president , Patricia Bryson , said in a statement . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

    "163": "WASHINGTON ( ███ ) - President Donald Trump ’ s legal troubles deepened on Wednesday as a federal judge refused to throw out a lawsuit accusing him of flouting constitutional safeguards against corruption by maintaining ownership of his business empire while in office .\nU.S. District Judge Peter Messitte in Greenbelt , Maryland allowed the lawsuit filed by Maryland and District of Columbia to proceed , rejecting a Justice Department request that it be dismissed . The judge , however , narrowed the claims to include only those involving the Trump International Hotel in Washington and not Trump ’ s businesses outside of the U.S. capital .\nA U.S. judge in Manhattan in December threw out a similar lawsuit against Trump brought by another group of plaintiffs .\nBoth lawsuits accused Trump of violating the U.S. Constitution ’ s “ emoluments ” provisions designed to prevent corruption and foreign influence . One bars U.S. officials from accepting gifts or other emoluments from foreign governments without congressional approval . The other forbids the president from receiving emoluments from individual states .\nIf the lawsuit presided over by Messitte continues to move forward , the plaintiffs have indicated they would seek a number of documents related to the president , including his tax returns , which Trump has refused to release .\nThe lawsuit , filed last June , said the Republican president has failed to disentangle himself from his hotels and other businesses , making him vulnerable to inducements by officials seeking to curry favor .\nMaryland Attorney General Brian Frosh , a Democrat , said in an interview he was pleased with the judge ’ s action .\n“ It demonstrates that Donald Trump is not above the law , that he like every other federal employee is governed by the emoluments clause , the original anti-corruption law of the United States . And we intend to hold him accountable , ” Frosh said .\nJustice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said , “ As we argued , we believe this case should be dismissed , and we will continue to defend the president in court . ”\nAs part of the suit , the District of Columbia and Maryland said their local residents who compete with Trump ’ s businesses like Trump International Hotel are harmed by decreased patronage , wages and tips .\nTrump ’ s attorneys said such claims were speculative and raised doubts that any harm to competition could be traced directly to Trump ’ s status as president .\nMessitte rejected that view , saying the plaintiffs ’ allegations were sufficient to allow the case to proceed .\n“ Their allegation is bolstered by explicit statements from certain foreign government officials indicating that they are clearly choosing to stay at the president ’ s hotel , because , as one representative of a foreign government has stated , they want him to know ‘ I love your new hotel , ’ ” the judge wrote .\nMessitte also noted that since the 2016 presidential election , “ foreign governments have indisputably transferred business from the Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton hotels in the District to the President ’ s Hotel . ”\nTrump ’ s legal woes are mounting . His lead lawyer in the intensifying special counsel investigation into Russia ’ s role in the 2016 presidential election resigned last week .\nA New York state judge last week allowed a defamation lawsuit by a woman who accused Trump of sexually harassing her after she appeared on his former reality TV show to proceed .\nHe also is facing lawsuits from adult film actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal arising from affairs they said they had with the president .\nTrump , a wealthy real estate developer who as president regularly visits his own hotels , resorts and golf clubs , has ceded day-to-day control of his businesses to his sons .

    "167": "Williamsburg , Virginia ( CNN ) - While at a GOP retreat , House Republican leaders on Friday announced a vote next week on a three-month extension of the debt limit , with a requirement that both chambers pass a budget or else go without pay .\nThe added condition to the short term extension bill aims to force the Democratic-led Senate to pass a budget–something the upper chamber has n't done in four years .\n`` That is a shameful run that needs to end , this year , '' House Speaker John Boehner said in his closing remarks at the retreat , according to excerpts provided by his office . `` We are going to pursue strategies that will obligate the Senate to finally join the House in confronting the government ’ s spending problem . ''\nBuilding onto that , House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said in a statement that if the Senate or House fail to pass a budget in three months , members of Congress `` will not be paid by the American people for failing to do their job . No budget , no pay . ''\nHouse GOP Whip Kevin McCarthy told CNN that `` what we 're trying to do is put us on a path to a balanced budget . ''\n`` April 15th is the deadline for both houses to pass a budget , '' he continued . `` A budget is a roadmap to not only where you are but where you can go . Unfortunately the House has passed one the last two times , but the Senate has not , and what has that created ? A $ 16 trillion debt . An idea of not knowing where our economy is gon na go . ''\nThe short-term extension strategy represents a departure from recent discussions where Republicans pushed that any increase in the debt limit must include spending cuts that amounted to the same size of the increase .\nAnd Republican leaders seem to be steering clear of any suggestions that the party is willing to risk allowing the government to default on its loans–the consequence should the debt ceiling be kept as is–as a way to put pressure on the White House and Senate Democrats to carve out drastic spending cuts .\n`` We are not going to default- I do n't know of anybody , and I move in fairly fiscally conservative circles within our party – none of us are talking about default , '' said conservative GOP Rep. Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina . He also signaled he agreed with the new House GOP strategy .\n`` If you can figure out ways to get little types of reforms , little fixes for small extensions I do n't find that objectionable , '' Mulvaney told reporters .\nThis is a notable shift , given that Mulvaney , and many of his colleagues elected in 2010 , pushed for major spending cuts in exchange for increasing the debt limit .\nAdam Jentleson , a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid responded Friday , saying the Senate would be `` happy to consider '' the House bill if it would `` avoid default and allow the United States to meet its existing obligations . ''\n`` We have an obligation to pay the bills we have already incurred – bills for which many House Republicans voted , '' Jentleson continued , though he did n't address the Republicans ' condition about passing a budget .\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , meanwhile , agreed with House Republicans ' insistence on a budget from the Senate .\n“ It ’ s not the discussion about the debt and budget failures that has put our nation ’ s credit rating at risk-it ’ s the unsustainable debt , the out-of-control Washington spending , and the failure to budget that got us here . It ’ s time to change , and the debt ceiling discussion is the perfect time for that debate , ” he said in a statement .\nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney also responded to the news Friday afternoon .\n`` We are encouraged that there are signs that Congressional Republicans may back off their insistence on holding our economy hostage to extract drastic cuts in Medicare , education and programs middle class families depend on , '' he said .\nPresident Barack Obama , however , has previously closed the door to negotiating over the debt ceiling or passing a solution in increments , saying `` America can not afford another debate with this Congress about whether or not they should pay the bills they 've already racked up . ''\n`` They 're going to have to send me something that 's sensible . And we should n't be doing this ... on a one to three-month timeframe , '' Obama said at a news conference on Monday . `` Why would we do that ? This is the United States of America . ... What , we ca n't manage our affairs in such a way that we pay our bills and we provide some certainty in terms of how we pay our bills ? ''\nThe necessity of raising the debt ceiling comes shortly after the fiscal cliff , which found Republicans and Democrats at stalemate for weeks over averting tax increases and spending cuts that they had designed to trigger if they could not reach a deal .\n`` I 'm not going to have a monthly or every-three-months conversation about whether or not we pay our bills , '' Obama said . `` Because that in and of itself does severe damage . Even the threat of default hurts our economy . It 's hurting our economy as we speak . We should n't be having that debate . ''\nRepublican Rep. John Fleming , R-Louisiana , said Thursday the short-term extension idea came out of an ad hoc group led by House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan , and Boehner signaled he supported the approach .\nAt one of the closed door sessions at the retreat , rank and file members viewed a slide show that highlighted how one of the last major deficit reduction packages – known as Gramm-Rudman – was preceded by a series of short term extensions in the debt ceiling .\n`` I think we 're all pretty much on board , '' Fleming said , and noted that impetus behind it was to keep the pressure on for reaching a broader deal to cut spending . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "168": "The last days of Washington , D.C. : America can no longer mask its steep decline No matter how relentlessly we couch our military defeats , all empirical evidence point to a single conclusion\nThe dishonesty of words illustrates the dishonesty of America ’ s wars .\nSince 9/11 , can there be any doubt that the public has become numb to the euphemisms that regularly accompany U.S. troops , drones , and CIA operatives into Washington ’ s imperial conflicts across the Greater Middle East and Africa ? Such euphemisms are meant to take the sting out of America ’ s wars back home . Many of these words and phrases are already so well known and well worn that no one thinks twice about them anymore .\nHere are just a few : collateral damage for killed and wounded civilians ( a term used regularly since the First Gulf War of 1990-1991 ) . Enhanced interrogation techniques for torture , a term adopted with vigor by George W. Bush , Dick Cheney , and the rest of their administration ( “ techniques ” that were actually demonstrated in the White House ) . Extraordinary rendition for CIA kidnappings of terror suspects off global streets or from remote badlands , often followed by the employment of enhanced interrogation techniques at U.S. black sites or other foreign hellholes . Detainees for prisoners and detention camp for prison ( or , in some cases , more honestly , concentration camp ) , used to describe Guantánamo ( Gitmo ) , among other places established offshore of American justice . Targeted killings for presidentially ordered drone assassinations . Boots on the ground for yet another deployment of “ our ” troops ( and not just their boots ) in harm ’ s way . Even the Bush administration ’ s Global War on Terror , its label for an attempt to transform the Greater Middle East into a Pax Americana , would be redubbed in the Obama years overseas contingency operations ( before any attempt at labeling was dropped for a no-name war pursued across major swathes of the planet ) .\nAs euphemisms were deployed to cloak that war ’ s bitter and brutal realities , over-the-top honorifics were assigned to America ’ s embattled role in the world . Exceptional , indispensable , and greatest have been the three words most commonly used by presidents , politicians , and the gung ho to describe this country . Once upon a time , if Americans thought this way , they felt no need to have their presidents and presidential candidates actually say so -- such was the confidence of the golden age of American power . So consider the constant redeployment of these terms a small measure of America ’ s growing defensiveness about itself , its sense of doubt and decline rather than strength and confidence .\nTo what end this concerted assault on the words we use ? In George Orwell ’ s classic 1946 essay “ Politics and the English Language , ” he noted that his era ’ s equivalents for “ collateral damage ” were “ needed if one wants to name things without calling up mental pictures of them. ” Obviously , not much has changed in the intervening seven decades . And this is , as Orwell intuited , a dangerous way to go . Cloaking violent , even murderous actions in anodyne language might help a few doubting functionaries sleep easier at night , but it should make the rest of us profoundly uneasy .\nThe more American leaders and officials -- and the media that quotes them endlessly -- employ such euphemisms to cloak harsh realities , the more they ensure that such harshness will endure ; indeed , that it is likely to grow harsher and more pernicious as we continue to settle into a world of euphemistic thinking .\nIn the future , some linguist or lexicographer will doubtless compile a dictionary of perpetual war and perhaps ( since they may be linked ) imperial decline , focusing on the grim processes and versions of failure language can cloak . It would undoubtedly explore how certain words and rhetorical devices were used in twenty-first-century America to obscure the heavy burdens that war placed on the country , even as they facilitated its continuingfailed conflicts . It would obviously include classic examples like surge , used in both Iraq and Afghanistan to obscure the way our government rushed extra troops into a battle zone in a moment of failure only ensuring the extension of that failure , and the now-classic phrase shock and awe that obscured the reality of a massive air strike on Baghdad that resulted in the deaths of dozens of civilians ( “ collateral damage ” ) , but not the “ decapitation ” of a hated regime .\nDon ’ t think , however , that the language of twenty-first-century American war was only meant to lull the public . Less familiar words and terms continue to be used within the military not to clarify tasks at hand but to obscure certain obvious realities even from those sanctioned to deal with them . Takeasymmetrical warfare , the gray zone , and VUCA . Unless you spend time in Department of Defense and military circles , you probably haven ’ t heard of these .\nAsymmetrical warfare suggests that the enemy fights unfairly and in a thoroughly cowardly fashion , regularly lurking behind and mixing with civilians ( “ hostages ” ) , because that enemy doesn ’ t have the moxie to don uniforms and stand toe-to-toe in a “ kinetic ” smack-down with U.S. troops . As a result , of course , the U.S. must be prepared for underhanded tactics and devious weaponry , including ambushes and IEDs ( improvised explosive devices , or roadside bombs ) , as well as a range of other “ unconventional ” tactics now all too familiar in a world plagued by violent attacks against “ soft ” targets ( aka civilians ) . It must also be prepared to engage an enemy mixed in with a civilian population and so brace itself for the inevitable collateral damage that is now so much the essence of American war .\nThat groups like the Islamic State ( ISIS ) would choose to fight “ asymmetrically ” should hardly come as a surprise to anyone who ’ s ever been confronted by a much bigger and better armed kid in a schoolyard . Misdirection , a sucker punch , a slingshot , even running away to fight another day are “ asymmetrical ” approaches that are sensible indeed for any outgunned and overmatched opponent . The term is a truism , nothing more , when it comes to the realities of our world . It is , however , a useful way of framing matters for those in the Pentagon and the military who don ’ t want to think seriously about the grim course of action , focused significantly on civilian populations , they are pursuing , which often instills anger and the urge for revenge in such populations and so , in the end , runs at cross purposes to stated U.S. aims .\nThe “ gray zone ” is a fuzzy term used in military circles to describe the perplexing nature of lower-level conflicts , often involving non-state actors , that don ’ t qualify as full-fledged wars . These are often fought using non-traditional weapons and tactics ranging from cyber attacks to the propagandizing of potential terror recruits via social media . This “ zone ” is unnerving to Pentagon types in part because the vast majority of the Pentagon ’ s funding goes to conventional weaponry that ’ s as subtle as a sledgehammer : big-ticket items like aircraft carriers , nuclear submarines , main battle tanks , strategic bombers , and wildly expensive multi-role aircraft such as the F-35 ( now estimated to cost roughly $ 1.4 trillion through its lifecycle ) . Much of this weaponry is “ too big to fail ” in the funding wars in Washington , but regularly fails in the field precisely because it ’ s too big to be used effectively against the latest crop of evasive enemies . Hence , that irresolvable gray zone which plagues America ’ s defense planners and operatives .\nThe question the gray zone both raises and obscures is : Why has the U.S. done so poorly when , by its own definition , it remains the biggest , baddest superpower around , the one that outspends its non-state enemies by a factor so large it can ’ t even be calculated ? Keep in mind , for instance , that the 9/11 attacks on American soil were estimated to have cost Osama bin Laden at most a half-million dollars . Multiply that by 400 and you can buy one “ made in America ” F-35 jet fighter .\nIf the gray zone offers little help clarifying America ’ s military dilemmas , what about VUCA ? It ’ s an acronym for volatile , uncertain , complex , and ambiguous , which is meant to describe our post-9/11 world . Of course , there ’ s nothing like an acronym to take the sting out of any world . But as an historian who has read a lot of history books , let me confess that , to the best of my knowledge , the world has always been , is now , and will always be VUCA .\nFor any future historian of the Pentagon ’ s language , let me sum things up this way : instead of honest talk about war in all its ugliness and uncertainty , military professionals of our era have tended to substitute buzz words , catchphrases , and acronyms . It ’ s a way of muddying the water . It allows the world of war to tumble on without serious challenge , which is why it ’ s been so useful in these years to speak of , say , COIN ( Counterinsurgency ) or 4GW ( Fourth-Generation Warfare ) .\nMuch like its most recent enthusiast , General David Petraeus , COIN has once again lost favor in the military , but Fourth-Generation Warfare is still riding high and sounds so refreshingly forward-looking , not like the stale Vietnam-era wine in a post-9/11 bottle that it is . In reality , it ’ s another iteration of insurgency and COIN mixed and matched with Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong ’ s people 's war . To prevail in places like Afghanistan , so 4GW thinkers suggest , one needs to win hearts and minds -- yes , that classic phrase of defeat in Vietnam -- while securing and protecting ( a definite COINage ) the people against insurgents and terrorists . In other words , we ’ re talking about an acronym that immediately begins to congeal if you use older words to describe it like “ pacification ” and “ nation-building. ” The latest 4GW jargon may not help win wars , but it does sometimes win healthy research grants from the government .\nThe fact is that trendy acronyms and snappy buzz words have a way of limiting genuine thinking on war . If America is to win ( or , far better , avoid ) future wars , its war professionals need to look more honestly at that phenomenon in all of its dimensions . So , too , do the American people , for it ’ s in their name that such wars are allegedly waged .\nThese days , Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter often resorts to cancer imagery when describing the Islamic state . `` Parent tumor '' is an image he especially favors -- that is , terrorism as a cancer that America ’ s militarized surgeons need to attack and destroy before it metastasizes and has “ children. ” ( Think of the ISIS franchises in Libya , where the organization has recently doubled in size , Afghanistan , and Yemen . ) Hence the proliferation of “ surgical strikes ” by drones and similarly “ surgical ” Special Ops raids , both of which you could think of as America ’ s equivalent of white blood cells in its war on the cancer of terrorism .\nBut is terrorism really a civilizational cancer that can be “ cured ” via the most aggressive “ kinetic ” treatments ? Can the U.S. render the world cancer-free ? For that ’ s what Carter ’ s language implies . And how does one measure “ progress ” in a “ war ” on the cancer of ISIS ? Indeed , from an outsider ’ s perspective , the proliferation of U.S. military bases around the world ( there are now roughly 800 ) , as well as of drone strikes , Special Ops raids , and massive weapons exports might have a cancerous look to them . In other words , what constitutes a “ cancer ” depends on one ’ s perspective -- and perhaps one ’ s definition of world “ health , ” too .\nThe very notion of progress in America ’ s recent wars is one that a colleague , Michael Murry , recently critiqued . A U.S. Navy Vietnam War Veteran , he wrote me that , for his favorite military euphemism , “ I have to go with ‘ progress ’ as incessantly chanted by the American military brass in Iraq and Afghanistan…\n“ We go on hearing about 14 years of ‘ progress ’ which , to hear our generals tell it , would vanish in an instant should the United States withdraw its forces and let the locals and their neighbors sort things out . Since when do ‘ fragile gains ’ equate to ‘ progress ’ ? Who in their right mind would invest rivers of blood and trillions of dollars in ‘ fragility ’ ? Now that I think of it , we also have the euphemistic expression of ‘ drawdown ’ substituting for ‘ withdrawal ’ which in turn substitutes for ‘ retreat. ’ The U.S. military and the civilian government it has browbeaten into hapless acquiescence simply can not face the truth of their monumental failures and so must continually bastardize our language in a losing -- almost comical -- attempt to stay one linguistic step ahead of the truth . ”\nProgress , as Murry notes , basically means nothing when such “ gains , ” in the words of David Petraeus during the surge months in Iraq in 2007 , are both “ fragile ” and “ reversible. ” Indeed , Petraeus repeated the same two words in 2011 to describe similar U.S. “ progress ” in Afghanistan , and today it couldn ’ t be clearer just how much “ progress ” was truly made there . Isn ’ t it time for government officials to stop banging the drums of war talk in favor of “ progress ” when none exists ?\nThink , for instance , of the American-trained ( and now re-trained ) Iraqi security forces . Each year U.S. officials swear that the Iraqi military is getting ever closer to combat readiness , but much like one of Zeno ’ s paradoxes , the half-steps that military takes under American tutelage never seem to get it into fighting shape . Progress , eternally touted , seems always to lead to regress , eternally explained away , as that army regularly underperforms or its units simply collapse , often abandoning their American-supplied weaponry to the enemy . Here we are , 12 years after the U.S. began training the Iraqi military and once again it seems to be cratering , this time while supposedly on the road to retaking Iraq ’ s second largest city , Mosul , from its Islamic State occupiers . Progress , anyone ?\nIn short , the dishonesty of the words the U.S. military regularly wields illustrates the dishonesty of its never-ending wars . After so many years of failure and frustration , of wars that aren ’ t won and terrorist movements that only seem to spread as its leaders are knocked off , isn ’ t it past time for Americans to ditch phrases like “ collateral damage , ” “ enemy noncombatant , ” “ no-fly zone ” ( or even worse , “ safe zone ” ) , and “ surgical strike ” and adopt a language , however grim , that accurately describes the military realities of this era ?\nWords matter , especially words about war . So as a change of pace , instead of the usual bloodless euphemisms and vapid acronyms , perhaps the U.S. government could tell the shocking and awful truth to the American people in plain language about the realities and dangers of never-ending war . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "169": "House Republicans unveiled a stopgap measure today to fund the federal government through the rest of the fiscal year , a move intended to mollify a deeply divided Congress that has fought through three years of bruising budget battles .\nThe continuing resolution , known around Washington as a CR , is subject to sequestration levels in its entirety , setting the top-line overall rate of spending at $ 982 billion , down from $ 1.047 trillion the previous fiscal year .\nThe CR keeps the FY2012 spending level as a base for 10 out of 12 appropriations bills , but notably , the legislation includes a full-year Defense appropriations bill , as well as a full-year Military Construction/Veterans Affairs appropriations bill . These two measures , which are still subject to sequestration , were negotiated with broad bipartisan support even though they did not become law during the last session of Congress .\nAides on both sides of the aisle say the funding tactic enables lawmakers to respond to changing circumstances or address the funding priorities of an agency rather than rely on existing spending plans that may have become outdated or impractical .\n`` The legislation will avoid a government shutdown on March 27 , prioritize DoD and Veterans programs , and allow the Pentagon some leeway to do its best with the funding it has , '' Rep. Hal Rogers , the chairman of the appropriations committee , wrote in a statement Monday . `` This CR package is the right thing to do , and it 's the right time to do it . ''\nFor example , former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta told Congress the Pentagon has an $ 11 billion shortfall below the administration 's request this year for the Operations and Maintenance section of the defense budget . To close that deficit , the Defense appropriations bill included in the CR takes about $ 7 billion from Research and Development and Procurement and increases the authority for Operations and Maintenance by about $ 10.4 billion .\nWhile in practice the rebalanced money for Operations and Maintenance cushions the effect of the arbitrary sequestration cuts , aides say legislators drafting the bill did not write the bill with the intent to offset sequestration .\n`` It 's just the right thing to focus on the core function of government : national security , '' one House Republican aide said . `` An $ 11 billion shortfall [ in Operations and Maintenance ] affects readiness . ''\nDemocrats , however , contend that the Pentagon and Department of Veterans Affairs are `` not unique '' to the funding challenges facing Washington . Rep. Nita Lowey , the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee , said it is `` extremely disappointing '' that the CR locks most of the federal government into `` outdated plans and spending levels . ''\n`` Governing by continuing resolution limits the ability of federal departments and agencies to respond to changing circumstances , implement laws enacted by Congress , eliminate unnecessary spending , and budget responsibly , '' said Lowey , D-N.Y. `` It has an adverse effect on federal efforts to improve schools , health care , and homeland security ; protect the environment ; and create jobs and grow the economy . ''\nThe legislation also addresses an apparent need for increased security , identified after the Benghazi attack in Libya , by including a provision to increase the current level for embassy security by about $ 2 billion . The CR also provides additional funding for federal prisons and includes a provision requiring Immigration and Customs Enforcement `` to sustain the mandated capacity of 34,000 detention beds . ''\nIt also extends the current pay freeze for federal employees , which includes members of Congress and Senators , even though President Obama has issued an executive order implementing a 0.5 percent pay increase .\nDespite an impasse over sequestration last week , House Speaker John Boehner emerged from a meeting with President Obama and other congressional leaders Friday , assuring reporters that a government shutdown is not in the cards .\n`` The House is going to move a continuing resolution next week to fund the government past March 27 , and I 'm hopeful that we wo n't have to deal with the threat of a government shutdown while we 're dealing with the sequester at the same time , '' Boehner , R-Ohio , said .\nThe bill is expected to be on the floor for debate on Wednesday and a vote on Thursday . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "170": "Washington ( CNN ) – Days after President Barack Obama is sworn-in for a second term , Republican leaders from across the country will assemble in the southern city where Obama accepted his party ’ s presidential nomination in September to strategize a path forward for the GOP in a nation experiencing major demographic shifts .\nIt will be a three-day discussion focused primarily on how to grow the Republican Party by convincing black , Hispanic and Asian voters that the GOP better represents their values than the Democratic Party , according to a party official involved in the planning of the Republican National Committee ’ s winter meeting in Charlotte , North Carolina , who spoke on the condition of anonymity .\nThe argument , certainly in the near term , will be tough sell for the GOP , given the unyielding positions and controversial comments from some conservative lawmakers and opinion leaders on the issue of illegal immigration and Democrats ’ deep ties to the black community . The CNN Exit Poll from the 2012 presidential election showed that Obama won 93 % of the black vote , 71 % of the Hispanic vote and 73 % of the Asian vote .\n“ The big takeaway that will be discussed during the week and championed by Priebus is that the party needs more voters and needs to do a better job of reaching out to minority communities and not just six months before the election , ” said the Republican official .\nPriebus is RNC Chairman Reince Priebus , a 40-year-old lawyer from Wisconsin , who , until two years ago , was relatively unknown outside of the small , clubby world of the committee , an organization that has only 168 members . In January 2011 , Priebus emerged from a pack of similarly ambitious Republicans , including his former political ally and then-Chairman Michael Steele , for the right to lead the national party . He inherited more than $ 20 million of debt after the 2010 midterm elections and a depressed RNC donor base that was being courted by White House hopefuls and congressional Republicans .\nPriebus eventually pulled the RNC out of the red and handed Mitt Romney a relatively healthy national party operation when the former Massachusetts governor became the Republican presidential nominee . Paperwork filed with the Federal Election Commission shows that the RNC ended 2012 with about $ 3.3 million in the bank and no debt .\nWith the White House in Democratic hands and Capitol Hill Republicans focused on legislative fights with Obama , the task to grow the GOP , for now , rests primarily on his shoulders . He is expected to win a second term as national chairman as he faces only token opposition from a Maine Republican at the party ’ s meeting in North Carolina . Republicans won the state in November , the only bright spot in crushing November defeats where Obama easily defeated Romney , Republicans lost ground in the House and failed to regain control of the Senate .\nThe theme of the RNC meeting is “ Renew , Grow , Win , ” a tacit admission that the party has some serious political reckoning to deal with in the coming months , especially with the fast-growing Hispanic population .\n“ The ideas and the principles of the party are sound , ” said the GOP source . “ But the way they need to be communicated needs to be updated to become more relatable and relevant . ”\nThe source added that in his speech next week to fellow Republicans , Priebus will offer a “ very optimistic and bold agenda , ” but was careful not to say much more beyond the overall theme of trying to broaden the party ’ s appeal .\nAfter the election , Priebus pledged to do a top-to-bottom review of the party , named it the “ Growth and Opportunity Effort ” and appointed five Republicans to lead the project .\nWhile minority outreach and recruitment will serve as a main theme of the Charlotte meeting , Priebus is also expected to emphasize a need to update the party ’ s digital operations . The Obama campaign ’ s emphasis on developing and utilizing cutting edge technology and fusing it with traditional get-out-the vote methods was widely praised and considered key to the president winning a second term .\nRepresentatives from companies such as Facebook , Google and Twitter are expected to attend the meeting , said the source , as will Louisiana Gov . Bobby Jindal , one of many Republicans said to be eyeing a run for president in 2016 . Jindal will speak at a dinner on Thursday .\n“ Simply put , we can not win if we continue to fight just over battleground states , ” said the source , referring to the narrow mathematical paths to victory Romney had in the election . Large states such as California , New York and Pennsylvania are considered Democratic strongholds , and besides North Carolina , Romney failed to win any of the so-called swing states that neither party has a lock on , such as Colorado and Nevada , two states with growing Hispanic populations . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

    "173": "The greatest political spy drama of the age has been playing out daily for 12 months , with the former FBI chief Robert Mueller at its centre and an audience of millions around the world playing amateur detective .\nMueller , appointed special counsel to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election , has spent the last year diligently pursuing a complex web of money and influence – or , as Trump would have it , engaging in a “ $ 10,000,000 witch-hunt ” .\nDid Donald Trump win the White House aided by Russia ’ s hidden hand ? What does the steely special counsel know ? And as his inquiry into alleged collusion enters its second year today , when will he deliver ?\nMueller ’ s investigation has already yielded charges against four Trump associates and , while he has not spoken publicly , the charges testify to the scope of the investigation .\nSo far Mueller has brought charges or reached plea agreements against 19 people and three Russian entities . Trump ’ s former national security adviser Michael Flynn , campaign aide Rick Gates and former foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos have entered plea deals . Ex-election campaign chairman Paul Manafort has pleaded not guilty to charges of money laundering , tax fraud , failure to register as a foreign agent and other charges .\nAs the investigation encircles Trump , some of his family , his closest friends and White House officials have been questioned by Mueller ’ s team .\nMeanwhile , as the inquiry has expanded and dominated the news agenda over the last year , the real issues of people ’ s lives are in danger of being drowned out by obsessive cable television coverage of the Russia investigation .\nFrom leading columnists to frontline politicians , people are grappling with how to create space to talk about something other than Mueller .\nKyle Pope , editor and publisher of the Columbia Journalism Review , said while print and digital news media have mostly done a good job of lifting their gaze , cable news has struggled to escape a constant daily focus on Mueller and the Trump scandal .\n“ The Mueller investigation really boils down the partisan approach of cable news , ” he said , with MSNBC on the left and conservative Fox News on the right .\n“ My own reading is that both sides are losing credibility – you can only tell me so many times that this is the beginning of the end and it not happen for me to start turning it off . And you can only dismiss things as nonsense so many times without me realising , ‘ well you ’ re not paying attention to anything ’ . ”\nHe said : “ I do think there is too much reactivity . The outrage meter is broken . The calibration of it is all messed up . Little things cause people to go crazy . Things I think are much bigger and more important seem to pass unnoticed . ”\nCrucial issues are ignored in a breathless television news cycle that seems incapable of going after more than one subject at a time .\nLatest cable news audience figures from Nielsen suggest some evidence of what Pope calls audience ‘ burnout ’ .\nFox News is still number one in US cable news , but prime-time viewers have slipped 13 % in the first quarter of 2018 compared with the peak first three months of the Trump presidency when the channel set records . CNN , which has begun to break the habit of always carrying entire Trump speeches live , is also down 17 % in prime time . By contrast , the Trump obsession burns strong for viewers of the liberal-leaning MSNBC – at 1.85 million viewers , it is smaller than Fox , but up by 30 % year-on-year .\nWhile CNN , Fox News and MSNBC viewers stagger from one Trump scandal to the next , America ’ s deep social challenges may have been overlooked in the past year , but they have emphatically not gone away .\nTeachers – vilified for years by conservative politicians – have gone on strike , highlighting stagnant wages and impoverished schools .\nTax cuts have been rammed through by Trump and Republicans in Congress for the benefit of corporations and the wealthiest Americans – including himself and his inner circle while the Fight for 15 continues to campaign against longer hours and low pay for millions of workers .\nTrump-Russia : Pence urges Mueller to end investigation – 'Time to wrap it up ' Read more\nThe Rev Dr William Barber ’ s Poor People ’ s Campaign has been on the march across the country for months , highlighting inequality and honouring the unfinished work of Dr Martin Luther King 50 years on .\nLife expectancy fell in America , with a 21 % increase in overdose deaths from legal and illegal opioids a key driver . Unions are coming under attack in the courts and from conservative groups in all 50 states .\nAn almost daily litany of cases reveals a justice system marred at every stage by inherent racial bias .\nPope said : “ I don ’ t turn on cable news and say , ‘ Hey , I wonder what happened in the world ’ . It ’ s more like what happened today in the Mueller investigation … they have almost just embraced the idea that it ’ s the Robert Mueller show and that ’ s it .\n“ I want to know about our crumbling cities , I want to know about race , I want to know about drug addiction , I want to know about schools . I live in New York and all of these things are very real and happening right now . ”\nNew York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof conceded in a recent article that like most Americans , he was addicted to the daily Trump minutiae . “ In America today , it ’ s all Trump , all the time . We ’ re collectively addicted to him . The non-stop scandals and outrages suck us in ; they amount to Trump porn . ”\nThe challenge for politicians trying to raise issues more relevant to people ’ s everyday lives is that they struggle to compete with the garish appeal of Trump . Jessica Post , executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee told the Daily Beast , she was dropped at the last moment three times from an MSNBC show as Trump news broke .\n“ It ’ s difficult to break through with stories about teachers ’ strikes or assaults on voting rights because there ’ s a new bad thing that Trump has done or Scott Pruitt has done in every news cycle , ” Post told the Daily Beast .\nFor some politicians struggling to change the subject , the answer has been to establish their own platforms and even stage their own events – Bernie Sanders has led the way , creating a Facebook account which is followed by more than 7 million people , where audiences of more than 1 million have tuned in for livestreams of town hall events covering issues such as income inequality and the movement for government-funded healthcare for all .\nFor campaigners trying to keep their issues alive , the challenge is how to reach and galvanise local activists while the news cycle is dominated by Trump drama .\nElizabeth Beaver , associate policy director for Indivisible , the organisation set up by former congressional staffers to cultivate a grassroots network opposed to the Trump agenda , said : “ It shouldn ’ t be the choice between do we talk about the Mueller investigation and the constant scandals of the Trump administration versus talk about the issues that affect everyone ’ s lives . We should be ‘ both/and ’ and should never be either/or . ”\nIndivisible tries to “ poke holes in the Trump agenda ” by alerting its network of 6,000 local groups to votes and issues unfolding in Congress that week , where they can put pressure on politicians through phone calls , events outside of their member of Congress ’ s offices and by showing up to town halls .\nShe praised some media outlets , but said : “ I would like to continue to see coverage that reflects the things that are happening in the US Congress that will affect us all for generations to come . Quite often , that will happen simultaneously with the scandals of the day from the Trump administration .\n“ The viewers can walk and chew gum at the same time , so I think that they expect the networks to do the same . ” \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "174": "( CNN ) – President Barack Obama should personally condemn the Internal Revenue Service for putting extra scrutiny on conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status , Sen. Susan Collins said Sunday .\nThe Maine Republican said the disclosure that a government agency would go after groups with `` tea party '' or `` patriot '' in their names would only add to a growing sense of mistrust Americans have in their government . She was one of a number of Republicans who blasted the IRS on Sunday 's talk shows .\n`` This is truly outrageous . And it contributes to the profound distrust that the American people have in government . It is absolutely chilling that the IRS was singling out conservative groups for extra review . And I think that it 's very disappointing that the president has n't personally condemned this and spoken out , '' Collins told CNN chief political correspondent Candy Crowley on `` State of the Union . ''\nObama spokesman Jay Carney said Saturday the president believes the government should be staffed with `` the very best public servants with the highest levels of integrity '' and that `` based on recent media reports , ( the president ) is concerned that the conduct of a small number of Internal Revenue Service employees may have fallen short of that standard . ''\nThat does n't go far enough for Collins , who said `` the president needs to make crystal clear that this is totally unacceptable in America . ''\nRep.

    "176": "Racist rancher and welfare cowboy Cliven Bundy got some help from an unexpected quarter over the weekend , as a far more wealthy and powerful racist grabbed the national spotlight , and mercifully tore it away from him .\nAs I write , Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling is still disputing the authenticity of a taped conservation with estranged girlfriend V. Stiviano , in which he purportedly berates her for attending Clippers games with Magic Johnson and other black celebrities , and for posting pictures of herself with blacks to her Instagram account .\n“ Yeah , it bothers me a lot that you want to promo – broadcast that you 're associating with black people , ” the man alleged to be Sterling said on the nine-minute tape reported on Saturday by TMZ Sports . A longer , 15-minute tape released on Sunday morning by Deadspin contained further damning details .\nWith breathtaking negative skill , Sterling — through his club — has managed to dispute the tapes ' authenticity in a careful manner that will likely turn out to be a lie . In a statement , Clippers president Andy Roeser said of the recording that the club does “ not know if it is legitimate or it has been altered . … Mr. Sterling is emphatic that what is reflected on that recording is not consistent with , nor does it reflect his views , beliefs or feelings . It is the antithesis of who he is , what he believes and how he has lived his life . ”\nNow , it 's true that Sterling may have been able to buy not one , but two “ lifetime achievement awards ” from the local NAACP chapter — plans for a second appear to have been pulled — but more shame on them for that . They appear to be just about the only ones around who share in his delusion .\nEveryone else familiar with Sterling 's actual record can be excused for laughing out loud in response . “ We all knew that Donald Sterling was a “ racist and an overall horrible human being , ” Deadspin wrote in its initial story based on TMZ 's original report .\n“ We do know the history of Donald Sterling , there 's nothing new , ” said veteran L.A.-based commentator Earl Ofari Hutchinson , on `` Disrupt With Karen Finney , '' shortly after the second tape was released . “ Here in Los Angeles , we 're very familiar with Sterling . I mean , he 's been sued , he 's actually been accused of harassment . There have been a number of things over time about Donald Sterling that are well-known in this community , in terms of his not only bad behavior , misbehavior , but also racist behavior . So when you hear this kind of tape , when you hear Sterling — and that 's Sterling , it is him , there 's no doubt about that — simply because the history has condemned him the history has proven that this man is capable of doing these things . ”\nIndeed , Sterling 's individual , personal racism is so clearly and publicly established that the incident provides a too-rare opportunity to focus less on his racism , and more on the social structures , context and expressive dynamics that make racism — or , more specifically , white supremacy — a much bigger deal than just the bad attitudes of a few scattered bad actors here and there .\nSince I already mentioned him , I 'll let Hutchinson get the ball rolling on this .\n“ Yes , Donald Sterling 's a racist . Yes Donald Sterling 's a bigot . Yes Donald Sterling should be maligned for everything , not only now , but in the past , ” Hutchinson said . “ But also , we really have to look at the NBA . ( Commissioner ) Adam Silver . The board of governors . And also the owners in the NBA . At the end of the day , Donald Sterling is your baby . So , really , the ball is in your court . And really the question that everybody is asking right now — and [ a ] legitimate question — what are you going to do about it ? ”\nThe question of league responsibility is further highlighted and problematized by Sterling 's own comments on the tape . Here 's an excerpt :\nDS : Well then , if you do n't feel—do n't come to my games . Do n't bring black people , and do n't come . V : Do you know that you have a whole team that 's black , that plays for you ? DS : You just , do I know ? I support them and give them food , and clothes , and cars , and houses . Who gives it to them ? Does someone else give it to them ? Do I know that I have—Who makes the game ? Do I make the game , or do they make the game ? Is there 30 owners , that created the league ? ( emphasis added )\nExcuse me . Donald Sterling gives the players on his team food ? Clothes ? Cars ? Houses ? They do n't work their asses off earning what they buy for themselves , building on a lifetime of hard work and practice , and years of unmitigated exploitation as unpaid athletes along the way ?\nDoes anyone other than Sterling have the slightest difficulty in hearing how much he sounds like a classic 19th century slave owner , talking about everything he 's done for his ungrateful slaves ?\nCertainly his question , “ Who makes the game ? ” recalls the slaveholders ' delusion that they alone created the enormous wealth they enjoyed . It was a believable fiction , I suppose , if first you absolutely convinced yourself that the slaves who did all the actual work were not people at all , but mere property , nothing more than livestock , really . One has to wonder : Is that what Sterling thinks of the men who play on his team today ?\nIf you have to ask , “ Who makes the game ? ” it 's a very interesting question , really , with many different possible ways to answer it . The sub-question , “ Is there 30 owners , that created the league ? ” is a good deal easier to answer : No . The current owners did not create the league . In fact , the NBA 's creation seems to have been designed specifically to demonstrate just how absurd the notion of creation is . Officially the NBA says it was founded as the Basketball Association of America in 1946 . But it only took on its current name in 1949 , when it absorbed some teams from the rival National Basketball League , which was founded a decade earlier than the BAA , in 1937 . Actually , the NBL was founded two years earlier than that , in 1935 , as Midwest Basketball Conference , but changed its name and expanded its size to reach a larger audience .\nReally , though , all that history is beside the point , because when it comes to professional basketball as it 's played today , the team that created the league as it is was never a part of it : the Harlem Globetrotters . They were the ones who pioneered the style of audacious , mind-bending individual athleticism , combined with incredible teamwork , which makes the game today as far removed from its 1940s form as it is from ice hockey on one of Saturn 's moons .\nWhich is why the idea of any owner carrying on like Sterling did is enough to make anyone die of laughter .\nBut there 's more . In a very different sense , the game is made by a complex web of legal and financial arrangements , not least those making it a legal monopoly , more like the British East India Company than anything America 's Founding Fathers might have conceived of as an American way of doing things . If Sterling or any other owner thinks that he 's the one giving the players everything they eat , wear , drive , live in , or otherwise consume or save—then who exactly does he think gives him his own vast wealth ?\nBack in 2010 , Forbes described the Clippers in fairly underwhelming terms . Sterling bought the team in 1981 for $ 13 million ; in 2010 it had a player-costs-to-win ratio of 75 -- far below 100 , which is the norm . The team was valued at $ 305 million — a dramatic explosion of value since 1981 — but not because of any particular excellence , particularly on the part of Sterling . In the roundup section , “ The skinny , ” Forbes said :\nThe Clippers posted a mark of 29-53 during the 2009-10 campaign , missing the playoffs for the fourth consecutive year . Since Donald Sterling bought the team in 1981 the Clippers have made the playoffs just four times , the worst record in the NBA over that span . The Clippers have one of the lowest payrolls in the league year-in , year-out , but still manage to get less bank for the buck than most teams . During each of the past four seasons the Clippers had a wins-to-player-costs ratio below 100 , meaning the franchise generated less victories per dollar spent than the average NBA team . But the Clippers are also one of the NBA 's most profitable teams because they pay very little rent at the Staples Center , consistently draw over 16,000 fans per game and have a decent local television deal with FSN Prime Ticket , despite their horrific performance on the hardwood .\nThe team is having a much better year this year , but no one other than Sterling thinks this has anything to do with him .\nThe stadium the Clippers play in , Staples Center , was not built with taxpayers ' money , due to heroic resistance by the City Council in the mid-to-late 1990s , but it was still utterly dependent on city condemnation , property management and tax-increment funding ( story here ) . So once again we have a story of billionaires building their fortunes via government aid , the way it 's almost always done .\nIn short , Sterling 's wealth as a team owner is almost entirely due to the complex web of financial and political arrangements that shield him from the normal vicissitudes of free market competition .\nAnd this is the man who thinks he is the source of everything the Clippers are ? Could there be a better poster boy for everything wrong with the 1 percent ? Or , rather , the 1 percent of the 1 percent .\nBut let 's not forget the typical self-pitying , conservative “ I 'm the victim here ” mentality that Sterling so richly displays on the tape itself . The shorter version posted at Deadspin begin like this :\nV : `` Honey , I 'm sorry . Is there anything I can do to make you feel better ? '' DS : `` No , you can never make me feel better . '' V : `` I 'm sorry . '' DS : `` You 're just a fighter , you want to fight . And I 'm not the man who wants to fight . ''\nThe words alone only tell half the story . V. Stiviano 's tone throughout is soft and supportive , Sterling 's tone is harsh , embittered , softening only for purposes of self-pity . When he says , “ I 'm not the man who wants to fight , '' he sounds like a character on `` Justified '' who of course means exactly the opposite — and not one of the good guys .\nIt goes on in a similar fashion for some time , Sterling acting wounded , trying to start a fight , V. Stiviano trying to lick his wounds for him , which only makes him madder .\nV : `` I 'm sorry , honey , can I get you a little bit more juice ? I do n't want to fight with you . '' DS : `` Of course you do , you love to fight . '' V : `` I do n't fight . '' DS : `` That 's all you do , you fight with everybody . '' V : `` I 'm sorry you feel that way , honey . I do n't know how this conversation even came about .\nThis corrosively self-pitying stance that Sterling has locked himself into forms the background to the racially ridiculous quotes you may have seen . In his mind , Sterling is n't racist — the world is . And he is just trying to live in it “ realistically ” — it 's all their fault ! At the same time , V. Stiviano is being terribly mean to him , because she refuses to be his 100 percent compliant sock-puppet , but instead tries to be an autonomous , but deeply caring friend , who is trying to see the world in a different light , as a more open-minded place — and to put him in touch with his own power to do the right thing , even if the world were as bad a place as he thinks it is .\nBut the powerless mega-millionaire will have none of it .

Which you are hearing about for the first time . ”\nUnder that bill , he said , companies that kept jobs in America would be rewarded while those sending operations offshore would “ get penalized severely ” .\nRex Tillerson says he wo n't quit but does n't deny calling Trump a 'moron ' Read more\n“ It ’ s both a carrot and a stick , ” Trump said . “ It is an incentive to stay . But it is perhaps even more so – if you leave , it ’ s going to be very tough for you to think that you ’ re going to be able to sell your product back into our country . ”\nIn a volley of four tweets issued on Tuesday morning , meanwhile , Trump seemed to say he was about to issue an executive action on healthcare . “ Since Congress can ’ t get its act together on HealthCare , ” he wrote , “ I will be using the power of the pen to give great HealthCare to many people – FAST . ”\nRepublican attempts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) have repeatedly failed in the Senate amid widespread opposition to plans that , nonpartisan analysis has said , would take access to health insurance away from millions of Americans .\nTrump ’ s threat of executive action – he has said he may sign an order to allow people to buy insurance across state lines – stood at odds with what he told Forbes . “ The Democrats want to make a deal , ” he said . “ At the same time , I think I have a deal with the Republicans . So I have the best of both worlds . That ’ s business to a certain extent . I ’ m very able to make deals with Democrats if I have to . ”\nMembers of the president ’ s own party have voted down the ACA replacement plans and one deficit hawk , Bob Corker of Tennessee , has emerged as an establishment voice against planned tax reform . Over the weekend , Trump and Corker engaged in a bizarre exchange of insults on Twitter and , in Corker ’ s case , through the pages of the New York Times .\n“ The failing New York Times set Liddle ’ Bob Corker up by recording his conversation , ” Trump tweeted on Tuesday , coining a new nickname based on Corker ’ s height ( 5ft 7in ) and accusing the newspaper of malpractice . “ [ Corker ] was made to sound a fool , and that ’ s what I am dealing with ! ”\nOn Sunday one of the Times reporters , Jonathan Martin , tweeted that Corker had planned his attack . “ He had two aides on line , one taping us , ” Martin wrote . “ Corker is effectively staging a slow-rolling public intervention with Trump . ”\nSanders joined the fray on Tuesday , telling reporters : “ Senator Corker is entitled to his own opinion but he ’ s certainly not entitled to his own facts . ”\nShe also elaborated on Trump ’ s claim that Corker is responsible for the Iran nuclear deal , which the president has fiercely criticised . “ Senator Corker worked with Nancy Pelosi and the Obama administration to pave the way for that legislation and basically rolled out the red carpet for the Iran deal , ” she said .\nSanders was challenged over the claim as reporters noted that Corker had opposed the deal . But she dug in , saying : “ He worked with them on the legislation that rolled that out . That ’ s what helped I think put things in motion . He may have voted against the deal ultimately , but he not only allowed the deal to happen , he gave it credibility . I stand by my statement . ”\nAsked if Corker should resign , as Trump ’ s former chief strategist Steve Bannon has demanded , Sanders replied : “ I think that ’ s a decision for Senator Corker and the people of Tennessee , not for us to decide . ”\nTrump demands Congress fund border wall as price for keeping Dreamers Read more\nAlso on Twitter on Tuesday , Trump turned his fire on Democrats over the possibility of a deal to protect Dreamers , young undocumented migrants brought to the country as children and previously protected by the Obama administration .\nDemocratic leaders expressed strong opposition to a list of hardline demands the White House issued on Sunday . Among other measures , the White House said funding for a border wall with Mexico would be part of any accord . Democrats and Dreamers reacted with horror ; the Congressional Hispanic Caucus said no deal could proceed if a wall was included .\n“ The problem with agreeing to a policy on immigration is that the Democrats don ’ t want secure borders , ” Trump wrote on Tuesday . “ They don ’ t care about safety for USA . ”\nTrump also complained again about the NFL , in which player protests during the anthem continue . “ Why is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our anthem , flag and country ? ” he wrote . “ Change tax law ! ”\nThe NFL gave up its federal tax-exempt status a few years ago and files tax returns as a taxable entity .\nThe final tweet of the early morning sequence took aim at ESPN and an anchor suspended over the anthem controversy . The tweet also returned to one of Trump ’ s main preoccupations : ratings .\n“ With Jemele Hill at the mike , it is no wonder ESPN ratings have ‘ tanked ’ . In fact , tanked so badly it is the talk of the industry ! ” \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "179": "A full week after the alleged “ shellacking “ of President Obama and the Democrats , the country remains a “ stucknation ” locked in a partisan standoff where both factions hold each other in contempt and have a long list of past grievances they want to relitigate .\nFor several years now , the two parties have so amped up the partisan rhetoric that what used to be middle ground is nothing but scorched earth . It 's a machine fueled by animus , but raises hundreds of millions of dollars for the warring factions and keeps the nation from a necessary reconciliation that 's a prerequisite for moving forward .\nListening to this cacophony that passes for political discourse , an alien from outer space would come to the conclusion that Americans really can ’ t stand each other and just don ’ t want to defeat their opponents but annihilate them .\nHistory is never shaped by one thing , but a confluence of trends and events . We have a president who just can ’ t figure out why everybody is not as smart as he is , and a disloyal opposition that so lusts for his demise they would shut down the government to make a rhetorical point .\nFor many Democratic partisans , the reactionary right is waging a war on women ’ s reproductive rights and working around the clock to strip the right to vote from people of color . A key core belief of many Tea Party Republicans is that Democrats can only win elections if they steal them .\nThis delegitimizing of the nation ’ s political process popped up for Democrats in Gore v. Bush in 2000 and now has captured conservatives , who pretty much refute the results of every election except for the ones they win . ( A notable exception was Ed Gillespie ’ s concession to Sen. Mark Warner , which went some distance in restoring the notion of a Virginian gentleman . )\nJust spend an hour listening to national talk show host Michael Savage and his many less talented imitators that blanket the airwaves . You will hear such a deep hatred for the president you ’ ll understand that Savage and his crowd just don ’ t have contempt for the president -- but for the tens of millions of their fellow Americans that voted for him twice .\nEven as ISIS does its thing Savage has described the sitting president as the “ enemy within ” who wants to spread Ebola , open the door to “ illegals , ” all so as to make the U.S. a third-world nation in a kind of egalitarian “ marxist ” exercise aimed at collapsing capitalism . These statements are made despite the president ’ s record deportations and unprecedented profits enjoyed by U.S. corporations during the president ’ s tenure . A mediocre chief executive he may be , but he certainly is not a marxist .\nWhile largely ignored by the mainstream media , Savage ’ s millions of loyal listeners are also voracious readers who sent his recently released “ Stop the Coming Civil War : My Savage Truth ” on to the Barnes and Nobles big seller list . The bookseller ’ s website says Savage tells his readers “ our nation is in real trouble and the seeds of a second conflagration have been sown . ”\nThis near violent alienation extends into the global warming debate with one side insisting that as long as there is a God we need not worry about environmental consequences and we must burn as much fossil fuel as possible to fire up prosperity for future generations . Their opponents see these “ climate change deniers ” as a clear and present danger to the planet , funded by fossil fuel profiteers , whose only reason for existing is accumulating as much material wealth as possible so as to extend their dominion over a quickly dying planet .\nThere is just no reconciling these alienated factions . Billions of dollars are backing up both narratives , even as the homeless stretch out in the street and West Africa begs for the basics . No wonder most Americans decided to sit out Choice 2014 .\nIn the aftermath of the 2014 midterms , the milquetoast political press offers a ho-hum narrative dominated by the politicians ' personal story . What ’ s President Obama ’ s legacy ? Which Republican will claim the 2016 nomination ? How do the results of 2014 impact former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ’ s chances to win the presidency ?\nRank them . Sort them . Do whatever your cyberalgorithms tell you will get the most eyeballs . The political reporting is so fixated on who 's winning or falling behind that the horse race eclipses the actual economic and social conditions of the country . What they seem to be missing is just how badly polarized the nation is and just how many American households are still falling behind .\nAs for the voters ' hearts and minds , they get their shot during the exit polls . Based on those polls Republicans would be mistaken to interpret their victory as some kind of blank check . As the New York Times reported , voters surveyed this time around were skeptical of both parties . They believed the U.S. economy is rigged for the 1 percent and are doubtful their children will do better than they have .\nThere is something that is ruminating out there beyond the Beltway and the safe green zone of the corporate media that acts as its buffer . Looking at the “ right way-wrong way ” survey data by the NBC News/Wall Street Journal it has pretty much been all downhill from right after the Sept. 11 attack . That was when just over 70 percent of those surveyed thought the nation was headed in the right direction as ground zero still smoldered , the nation pulled together and the world embraced us as a victim of terrorism .\nBy this summer , more than 12 years into our global war on terror , and a few years into the “ recovery , ” that same poll was totally upside down with 70 percent now saying the nation was headed in the wrong direction . In the immediate run-up to the midterms the president said U.S. intelligence missed the rise of ISIS , the Secret Service left the front door of the White House and the Centers for Disease Control fumbled the initial response of Ebola .\nMost all the Democrats ran away from the president . Consistently the president was a couple of beats behind the breaking news where his handlers must have thought it was safe . Whether it was responding to the wave of undocumented children crossing the border , ISIS or Ebola the White House waited for events to play out for weeks and even months , and only when the media declared a “ crisis , ” would we get presidential action . It was as if President Obama ’ s heart wasn ’ t in doing his job .\nOff course for the Savage contingent this passiveness was extrapolated as premeditation and diabolical planning to collapse the nation into an oozing morass of disease and lawless chaos .\nThe president ’ s poor performance , whatever the reason for it , had consequences down ballot . Republicans not only won the U.S. Senate but they now hold 31 of the nation ’ s governorships , replacing Democrats in Arkansas , Illinois , Massachusetts and Maryland . The GOP now has total control , that is the governorship and the state legislatures , in 21 states compared to the Democrats who now have a third of that many .\nIn the state races there were no doubt local issues also in play . Yet New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie , who led the Republican Governors Association 's bid to capture as many state capitals as possible , says in the 35 states he visited voters expressed major anxiety about the president ’ s lack of leadership . “ I wouldn ’ t call it fear . I ’ d call it anxiety , really anxious . I think the best way to describe it was a woman I met who told me she was in her 80s from Vero Beach and she said to me , 'Governor what 's happened to our country ? We used to control events , now events control us . ' ”\n“ I think the reason folks are anxious is they feel like the president is weak and as a result our country is perceived to be weak , ” Christie told reporters after he voted . “ I think the country is looking for the president to be strong and I wish he would be . He ’ s my president too. ” Up against Michael Savage Christie sounds like Eisenhower , a throwback to the Republican Party that pledged allegiance to the flag and respected the occupant of the White House , no matter what his party affiliation , because they respected the office and by extension the broader electorate .\nThis nation ’ s existential crisis started well before President Obama was on the scene , as any graph over the growing wealth disparity will illustrate . What ails us goes deeper than a passive and detached president who 's reliably two beats behind the news wave and a Republican Party leadership committed to derailing his presidency at any cost . Even as the factions continue their war of attrition on each other , the American worker continued to fall behind , thanks to stagnant or declining wages despite increased productivity .\nThese are the same economic conditions candidate Barack Obama railed against , and before him candidate Bill Clinton . Yet from 1979 until 2013 productivity grew by almost 65 percent but average workers only saw their compensation increase by a measly 8 percent increase in those 33 years . More recently , from 2007 until 2013 the median U.S. income dropped every year and when adjusted for inflation was the lowest since 1995 .\nAll you need to know about the frame of mind of Americans for the 2014 midterm was in the small print of the latest Department of Labor report on employment that came a couple of days after the election . “ In October , the number of long-term unemployed ( those jobless for 27 weeks or more ) was little changed at 2.9 million , ” writes the Department of Labor , which translates to roughly a third of the unemployed . Civilian labor force participation continued its steady decline , hovering now at 62.8 percent , flat since April .\nLast month the DOL reported 7 million people were consigned to part-time work , even though they wanted full-time opportunities . Also in October , DOL said 2.2 million people were “ marginally attached to the labor force , ” a disconcerting stat DOL says “ was little changed from a year earlier. ” “ These individuals were not in the labor force ” but “ had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months . They were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in the four weeks preceding the survey . ”\nAt the same time that most U.S. households were stuck in neutral or slipping back into reverse , the top 1 percent continued to buzz by in overdrive leaving the rest of the U.S. in their dust . From the first half of 2013 to the first half of 2014 , real hourly wages fell across the board with the exception of states that raised the minimum wage . Meanwhile “ the wealthiest one percent captured 95 percent of the post financial crisis growth since 2009 , while the bottom 90 percent became poorer , ” according to the World Economic Forum ’ s Outlook on the Global Agenda 2014 .\nAnd while the business press chirped out happy faces over the officially declining unemployment number , the rest of the stats in the latest Department of Labor data described the ongoing wasting of a nation through workforce and wage stagnation .\nAmericans are trying to walk up the downward escalator whose motor is driven by corporate greed and bipartisan complicity . While corporations keep a lid on compensation and hiring they have increasingly become more skilled at stashing hundreds of billions of dollars in profits offshore , shifting their tax burden onto the same population that they have been squeezing for decades .\nBy some estimates as much as $ 2 trillion remains stashed offshore , kneecapping any real recovery . This creates a phony scarcity to help build back the pressure to get their tax cuts , shrink the federal government , help rescind the social contract and break what ’ s left of the American labor movement .\nHaving totally captured both political parties it is in the interests of corporations to fund the great American political kabuki dance that perpetuates the myth that on the issues that matter most to the corporations there ’ s a big difference between how both parties would govern . This partisan sideshow keeps the electorate distracted from the widening income disparity , wealth concentration and tax shifting that has happened under the leadership of both political parties for decades .\nIn 2008 we went for `` hope and change , '' but six years later there 's this sense we are still on a downward trajectory , despite the booming stock market and gas prices dropping so fast experts are worried . Our kids are burdened with billions in debt and now the very same Wall Street vultures that created the mortgage meltdown are coming back to buy up foreclosed homes so they can rent them to the serfs who now can ’ t afford their own castle .\nIt is this gnawing insecurity about the prospects for our families that is the psychological fallout from the Great Recession and our wars without end . For our grandparents it was shorthanded as the `` Depression era '' mentality . It defined every choice they made but also burnished a sense of national purpose , self-sacrifice and collectivity . It beat fascism on two fronts , came home , had a parade , built the interstate highway system , and sent their soldiers to school for free . But back then we had FDR who united the population against the speculators .\nToday most people grapple with their economic dislocation in isolation . The TV says we are in a recovery so it must be just me , my family , my household falling behind . Every day the TV says the market is up and yet that seems to have less and less to do with the average American family 's economic well-being .\nYes , we are a war-prone republic , but we have always had periods when we collectively stood down , albeit briefly . Now we are told we are in a further notice eternal war where peace comes only when we leave this earthly plain . I do n't know if the human psyche is wired for that .\nBut there is something else at work structurally that the media also shies away from because it undermines our superpower status narrative and the notion of our exceptionalism . Even talking about it one risks looking unpatriotic . For many Americans this has been the linchpin for their sense of well-being in an ever-changing world . We are just not up to coming to grips with the notion that planetary peace , prosperity and stability is truly a multilateral project . Where ’ s the national pride in that ?\nWhen the president was n't propping up the phony Bush war on terror narrative , he spoke eloquently about this reality as he did at West Point .\nPresident Obama is presiding in a period where in the scheme of world affairs , save the nuclear war option , the presidency is shrinking . This globally integrated marketplace we were so hell-bent to create has geopolitical consequences .\nYou can ’ t rely on China to finance your federal debt and not expect to lose leverage in the world . While Republicans like to put the shrinking of the presidency on the current occupant of the White House , it ignores structural things like that and the well-documented choice by U.S. multinationals and hedge funds to bet against America because they can make more money someplace else .\nIronically , these very hedge fund players that helped fund Christie ’ s Republican Governors Association , like Elliot Management ’ s Paul Singer who gave over a million dollars to the RGA , are the same crowd looking to profit from the inversion deals being cut by U.S. corporations to abandon the U.S. to reduce their U.S. tax liability .\nSo is it now , `` ask not what your country can do for you '' but which country gives you the highest rate of return ? \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

    "181": "Policy intellectuals -- eggheads presuming to instruct the mere mortals who actually run for office -- are a blight on the republic . Like some invasive species , they infest present-day Washington , where their presence strangles common sense and has brought to the verge of extinction the simple ability to perceive reality . A benign appearance -- well-dressed types testifying before Congress , pontificating in print and on TV , or even filling key positions in the executive branch -- belies a malign impact . They are like Asian carp let loose in the Great Lakes .\nIt all began innocently enough . Back in 1933 , with the country in the throes of the Great Depression , President Franklin Delano Roosevelt first imported a handful of eager academics to join the ranks of his New Deal . An unprecedented economic crisis required some fresh thinking , FDR believed . Whether the contributions of this “ Brains Trust ” made a positive impact or served to retard economic recovery ( or ended up being a wash ) remains a subject for debate even today . At the very least , however , the arrival of Adolph Berle , Raymond Moley , Rexford Tugwell , and others elevated Washington ’ s bourbon-and-cigars social scene . As bona fide members of the intelligentsia , they possessed a sort of cachet .\nThen came World War II , followed in short order by the onset of the Cold War . These events brought to Washington a second wave of deep thinkers , their agenda now focused on “ national security. ” This eminently elastic concept -- more properly , “ national insecurity ” -- encompassed just about anything related to preparing for , fighting , or surviving wars , including economics , technology , weapons design , decision-making , the structure of the armed forces , and other matters said to be of vital importance to the nation ’ s survival . National insecurity became , and remains today , the policy world ’ s equivalent of the gift that just keeps on giving .\nPeople who specialized in thinking about national insecurity came to be known as “ defense intellectuals. ” Pioneers in this endeavor back in the 1950s were as likely to collect their paychecks from think tanks like the prototypical RAND Corporation as from more traditional academic institutions . Their ranks included creepy figures like Herman Kahn , who took pride in “ thinking about the unthinkable , ” and Albert Wohlstetter , who tutored Washington in the complexities of maintaining “ the delicate balance of terror . ”\nIn this wonky world , the coin of the realm has been and remains “ policy relevance. ” This means devising products that convey a sense of novelty , while serving chiefly to perpetuate the ongoing enterprise . The ultimate example of a policy-relevant insight is Dr. Strangelove ’ s discovery of a “ mineshaft gap ” -- successor to the “ bomber gap ” and the “ missile gap ” that , in the 1950s , had found America allegedly lagging behind the Soviets in weaponry and desperately needing to catch up . Now , with a thermonuclear exchange about to destroy the planet , the United States is once more falling behind , Strangelove claims , this time in digging underground shelters enabling some small proportion of the population to survive .\nIn a single , brilliant stroke , Strangelove posits a new raison d'être for the entire national insecurity apparatus , thereby ensuring that the game will continue more or less forever . A sequel to Stanley Kubrick ’ s movie would have shown General “ Buck ” Turgidson and the other brass huddled in the War Room , developing plans to close the mineshaft gap as if nothing untoward had occurred .\nYet only in the 1960s , right around the time that Dr. Strangelove first appeared in movie theaters , did policy intellectuals really come into their own . The press now referred to them as “ action intellectuals , ” suggesting energy and impatience . Action intellectuals were thinkers , but also doers , members of a “ large and growing body of men who choose to leave their quiet and secure niches on the university campus and involve themselves instead in the perplexing problems that face the nation , ” as LIFE Magazineput it in 1967 . Among the most perplexing of those problems was what to do about Vietnam , just the sort of challenge an action intellectual could sink his teeth into .\nOver the previous century-and-a-half , the United States had gone to war for many reasons , including greed , fear , panic , righteous anger , and legitimate self-defense . On various occasions , each of these , alone or in combination , had prompted Americans to fight . Vietnam marked the first time that the United States went to war , at least in considerable part , in response to a bunch of really dumb ideas floated by ostensibly smart people occupying positions of influence . More surprising still , action intellectuals persisted in waging that war well past the point where it had become self-evident , even to members of Congress , that the cause was a misbegotten one doomed to end in failure .\nIn his fine new book American Reckoning : The Vietnam War and Our National Identity , Christian Appy , a historian who teaches at the University of Massachusetts , reminds us of just how dumb those ideas were .\nAs Exhibit A , Professor Appy presents McGeorge Bundy , national security adviser first for President John F. Kennedy and then for Lyndon Johnson . Bundy was a product of Groton and Yale , who famously became the youngest-ever dean of Harvard ’ s Faculty of Arts and Sciences , having gained tenure there without even bothering to get a graduate degree .\nFor Exhibit B , there is Walt Whitman Rostow , Bundy ’ s successor as national security adviser . Rostow was another Yalie , earning his undergraduate degree there along with a PhD . While taking a break of sorts , he spent two years at Oxford as a Rhodes scholar . As a professor of economic history at MIT , Rostow captured JFK ’ s attention with his modestly subtitled 1960 bookThe Stages of Economic Growth : A Non-Communist Manifesto , which offered a grand theory of development with ostensibly universal applicability . Kennedy brought Rostow to Washington to test his theories of “ modernization ” in places like Southeast Asia .\nFinally , as Exhibit C , Appy briefly discusses Professor Samuel P. Huntington ’ s contributions to the Vietnam War . Huntington also attended Yale , before earning his PhD at Harvard and then returning to teach there , becoming one of the most renowned political scientists of the post-World War II era .\nWhat the three shared in common , apart from a suspect education acquired in New Haven , was an unwavering commitment to the reigning verities of the Cold War . Foremost among those verities was this : that a monolith called Communism , controlled by a small group of fanatic ideologues hidden behind the walls of the Kremlin , posed an existential threat not simply to America and its allies , but to the very idea of freedom itself . The claim came with this essential corollary : the only hope of avoiding such a cataclysmic outcome was for the United States to vigorously resist the Communist threat wherever it reared its ugly head .\nBuy those twin propositions and you accept the imperative of the U.S. preventing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam , a.k.a . North Vietnam , from absorbing the Republic of Vietnam , a.k.a . South Vietnam , into a single unified country ; in other words , that South Vietnam was a cause worth fighting and dying for . Bundy , Rostow , and Huntington not only bought that argument hook , line , and sinker , but then exerted themselves mightily to persuade others in Washington to buy it as well .\nYet even as he was urging the “ Americanization ” of the Vietnam War in 1965 , Bundy already entertained doubts about whether it was winnable . But not to worry : even if the effort ended in failure , he counseled President Johnson , “ the policy will be worth it . ”\nHow so ? “ At a minimum , ” Bundy wrote , “ it will damp down the charge that we did not do all that we could have done , and this charge will be important in many countries , including our own. ” If the United States ultimately lost South Vietnam , at least Americans would have died trying to prevent that result -- and through some perverted logic this , in the estimation of Harvard ’ s youngest-ever dean , was a redeeming prospect . The essential point , Bundy believed , was to prevent others from seeing the United States as a “ paper tiger. ” To avoid a fight , even a losing one , was to forfeit credibility . “ Not to have it thought that when we commit ourselves we really mean no major risk ” -- that was the problem to be avoided at all cost .\nRostow outdid even Bundy in hawkishness . Apart from his relentless advocacy of coercive bombing to influence North Vietnamese policymakers , Rostow was a chief architect of something called the Strategic Hamlet Program . The idea was to jumpstart the Rostovian process of modernization by forcibly relocating Vietnamese peasants from their ancestral villages into armed camps where the Saigon government would provide security , education , medical care , and agricultural assistance . By winning hearts-and-minds in this manner , the defeat of the communist insurgency was sure to follow , with the people of South Vietnam vaulted into the “ age of high mass consumption , ” where Rostow believed all humankind was destined to end up .\nThat was the theory . Reality differed somewhat . Actual Strategic Hamlets were indistinguishable from concentration camps . The government in Saigon proved too weak , too incompetent , and too corrupt to hold up its end of the bargain . Rather than winning hearts-and-minds , the program induced alienation , even as it essentially destabilized peasant society . One result : an increasingly rootless rural population flooded into South Vietnam ’ s cities where there was little work apart from servicing the needs of the ever-growing U.S. military population -- hardly the sort of activity conducive to self-sustaining development .\nYet even when the Vietnam War ended in complete and utter defeat , Rostow still claimed vindication for his theory . “ We and the Southeast Asians , ” he wrote , had used the war years “ so well that there wasn ’ t the panic [ when Saigon fell ] that there would have been if we had failed to intervene. ” Indeed , regionally Rostow spied plenty of good news , all of it attributable to the American war .\n” Since 1975 there has been a general expansion of trade by the other countries of that region with Japan and the West . In Thailand we have seen the rise of a new class of entrepreneurs . Malaysia and Singapore have become countries of diverse manufactured exports . We can see the emergence of a much thicker layer of technocrats in Indonesia . ”\nSo there you have it . If you want to know what 58,000 Americans ( not to mention vastly larger numbers of Vietnamese ) died for , it was to encourage entrepreneurship , exports , and the emergence of technocrats elsewhere in Southeast Asia .\nAppy describes Professor Huntington as another action intellectual with an unfailing facility for seeing the upside of catastrophe . In Huntington ’ s view , the internal displacement of South Vietnamese caused by the excessive use of American firepower , along with the failure of Rostow ’ s Strategic Hamlets , was actually good news . It promised , he insisted , to give the Americans an edge over the insurgents .\nThe key to final victory , Huntington wrote , was “ forced-draft urbanization and modernization which rapidly brings the country in question out of the phase in which a rural revolutionary movement can hope to generate sufficient strength to come to power. ” By emptying out the countryside , the U.S. could win the war in the cities . “ The urban slum , which seems so horrible to middle-class Americans , often becomes for the poor peasant a gateway to a new and better way of life. ” The language may be a tad antiseptic , but the point is clear enough : the challenges of city life in a state of utter immiseration would miraculously transform those same peasants into go-getters more interested in making a buck than in signing up for social revolution .\nRevisited decades later , claims once made with a straight face by the likes of Bundy , Rostow , and Huntington -- action intellectuals of the very first rank -- seem beyond preposterous . They insult our intelligence , leaving us to wonder how such judgments or the people who promoted them were ever taken seriously .\nHow was it that during Vietnam bad ideas exerted such a perverse influence ? Why were those ideas so impervious to challenge ? Why , in short , was it so difficult for Americans to recognize bullshit for what it was ?\nThese questions are by no means of mere historical interest . They are no less relevant when applied to the handiwork of the twenty-first-century version of policy intellectuals , specializing in national insecurity , whose bullshit underpins policies hardly more coherent than those used to justify and prosecute the Vietnam War .\nThe present-day successors to Bundy , Rostow , and Huntington subscribe to their own reigning verities . Chief among them is this : that a phenomenon called terrorism or Islamic radicalism , inspired by a small group of fanatic ideologues hidden away in various quarters of the Greater Middle East , poses an existential threat not simply to America and its allies , but -- yes , it ’ s still with us -- to the very idea of freedom itself . That assertion comes with an essential corollary dusted off and imported from the Cold War : the only hope of avoiding this cataclysmic outcome is for the United States to vigorously resist the terrorist/Islamist threat wherever it rears its ugly head .\nAt least since September 11 , 2001 , and arguably for at least two decades prior to that date , U.S. policymakers have taken these propositions for granted . They have done so at least in part because few of the policy intellectuals specializing in national insecurity have bothered to question them .\nIndeed , those specialists insulate the state from having to address such questions . Think of them as intellectuals devoted to averting genuine intellectual activity . More or less like Herman Kahn and Albert Wohlstetter ( or Dr. Strangelove ) , their function is to perpetuate the ongoing enterprise .\nThe fact that the enterprise itself has become utterly amorphous may actually facilitate such efforts . Once widely known as the Global War on Terror , or GWOT , it has been transformed into the War with No Name . A little bit like the famous Supreme Court opinion on pornography : we can ’ t define it , we just know it when we see it , with ISIS the latest manifestation to capture Washington ’ s attention .\nAll that we can say for sure about this nameless undertaking is that it continues with no end in sight . It has become a sort of slow-motion Vietnam , stimulating remarkably little honest reflection regarding its course thus far or prospects for the future . If there is an actual Brains Trust at work in Washington , it operates on autopilot . Today , the second- and third-generation bastard offspring of RAND that clutter northwest Washington -- the Center for this , the Institute for that -- spin their wheels debating latter day equivalents of Strategic Hamlets , with nary a thought given to more fundamental concerns .\nWhat prompts these observations is Ashton Carter ’ s return to the Pentagon as President Obama ’ s fourth secretary of defense . Carter himself is an action intellectual in the Bundy , Rostow , Huntington mold , having made a career of rotating between positions at Harvard and in “ the Building. ” He , too , is a Yalie and a Rhodes scholar , with a PhD . from Oxford . “ Ash ” -- in Washington , a first-name-only identifier ( “ Henry , ” “ Zbig , ” “ Hillary ” ) signifies that you have truly arrived -- is the author of books and articles galore , including one op-ed co-written with former Secretary of Defense William Perry back in 2006 calling for preventive war against North Korea . Military action “ undoubtedly carries risk , ” he bravely acknowledged at the time . “ But the risk of continuing inaction in the face of North Korea 's race to threaten this country would be greater ” -- just the sort of logic periodically trotted out by the likes of Herman Kahn and Albert Wohlstetter .\nAs Carter has taken the Pentagon ’ s reins , he also has taken pains to convey the impression of being a big thinker . As one Wall Street Journal headline enthused , “ Ash Carter Seeks Fresh Eyes on Global Threats. ” That multiple global threats exist and that America ’ s defense secretary has a mandate to address each of them are , of course , givens . His predecessor Chuck Hagel ( no Yale degree ) was a bit of a plodder . By way of contrast , Carter has made clear his intention to shake things up .\nSo on his second day in office , for example , he dined with Kenneth Pollack , Michael O ’ Hanlon , and Robert Kagan , ranking national insecurity intellectuals and old Washington hands one and all . Besides all being employees of the Brookings Institution , the three share the distinction ofhaving supported the Iraq War back in 2003 and calling for redoubling efforts against ISIS today . For assurances that the fundamental orientation of U.S. policy is sound -- we just need to try harder -- who better to consult than Pollack , O ’ Hanlon , and Kagan ( any Kagan ) ?\nWas Carter hoping to gain some fresh insight from his dinner companions ? Or was he letting Washington ’ s clubby network of fellows , senior fellows , and distinguished fellows know that , on his watch , the prevailing verities of national insecurity would remain sacrosanct ? You decide .\nSoon thereafter , Carter ’ s first trip overseas provided another opportunity to signal his intentions . In Kuwait , he convened a war council of senior military and civilian officials to take stock of the campaign against ISIS . In a daring departure from standard practice , the new defense secretary prohibited PowerPoint briefings . One participant described the ensuing event as “ a five-hour-long college seminar ” -- candid and freewheeling . “ This is reversing the paradigm , ” one awed senior Pentagon official remarked . Carter was said to be challenging his subordinates to “ look at this problem differently . ”\nOf course , Carter might have said , “ Let ’ s look at a different problem. ” That , however , was far too radical to contemplate -- the equivalent of suggesting back in the 1960s that assumptions landing the United States in Vietnam should be reexamined .\nIn any event -- and to no one ’ s surprise -- the different look did not produce a different conclusion . Instead of reversing the paradigm , Carter affirmed it : the existing U.S. approach to dealing with ISIS is sound , he announced . It only needs a bit of tweaking -- just the result to give the Pollacks , O ’ Hanlons , and Kagans something to write about as they keep up the chatter that substitutes for serious debate .\nDo we really need that chatter ? Does it enhance the quality of U.S. policy ? If policy/defense/action intellectuals fell silent would America be less secure ?\nLet me propose an experiment . Put them on furlough . Not permanently -- just until the last of the winter snow finally melts in New England . Send them back to Yale for reeducation . Let ’ s see if we are able to make do without them even for a month or two .\nIn the meantime , invite Iraq and Afghanistan War vets to consider how best to deal with ISIS . Turn the op-ed pages of major newspapers over to high school social studies teachers . Book English majors from the Big Ten on the Sunday talk shows .

    "182": "Rep. Paul Ryan , R-Wis. , speaks about the 2014 Budget Resolution during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington , March 12 , 2013 . Carolyn Kaster/AP Photo\nWhen conservative House Republicans and liberal Democrats in the House Progressive Caucus each released their broad budget plans this week , what we really saw was a window into two drastically different visions of the future .\nRepublicans , led by Budget Chairman Paul Ryan , issued a 91-page doctrine of fiscal conservatism that claims to balance the budget in 10 years . The House Progressive Caucus , led by Reps. Raul Grijalva , D-Ariz. , and Keith Ellison , D-Minn. , released their own 19-page blueprint that lowers the deficit ( but does n't eliminate it ) by raising taxes while pumping investments into all the infrastructure , education , and public welfare programs liberals love .\nIt 's a tale of two budgets , and America 's alternate futures could n't be more different .\nIn the future according to Paul Ryan , most people take some kind of a hit , and the government survives to serve future generations because it 's restrained in the near term . Tax reform lowers rates on people and corporations ( including high incomes ) while stripping out deductions and credits . National defense remains fully funded , but Medicare is essentially voucherized for people turning 55 now ; Medicare survives and health-care costs are restrained , as patients turn down unnecessary procedures , saving the system from fiscal ruin .\nMedicare is block-granted , giving states more flexibility to do with the funds as they please . `` Obamacare '' is repealed , meaning no one has to buy health insurance , but also that the government spends a lot less helping people buy it . Tort reform means doctors do n't get sued as often , the government only gives welfare to people meeting the full set of work requirements ; job-training programs and `` career scholarships '' help people get to work , and the federal government accounts more accurately for the money it loans out .\nIf Ryan has his way , the federal government works in a streamlined and sustainable fashion , balancing its books in 10 years and saving basic services from bankruptcy so that future generations can enjoy them .\nIn the future according to the House Progressive Caucus , the Bush tax cuts expire for everyone making over $ 250,000 , and millionaires and billionaires see their tax rates jump from 45 percent . The federal government invests more in infrastructure , creating jobs , and unemployment claims can be made for almost two years ( 99 weeks ) . A public-option health system is adopted , while no benefits are cut in Medicare , Medicaid , or Social Security . Generic drugs become more available , as name-brand drug companies are barred from paying generic makers to delay sales in patent settlements .\nStates receive more money through block grants to hire police , firefighters , and teachers , and states also get more money for Medicaid . A new cap-and-trade system limits greenhouse-gas emissions on a large scale . Corporate tax credits that can benefit oil and gas production are rolled back . America swiftly withdraws from Afghanistan , eliminating emergency war funding and saving billions from the federal budget , while the military cuts contractors , spends less on bases , and slowly shrinks its force through attrition .\nThe progressive budget promises $ 4.4 trillion in deficit reduction largely by raising taxes and ending the war in Afghanistan . Government services are not only maintained , they 're widely expanded , and the federal government continues to run an aggregate $ 4.2 trillion deficit over the next 10 years , vs. Paul Ryan 's $ 1.2 trillion .\nAll of those things really are included in both these budget blueprints . Neither one of them will come true .\nIn fact , almost none of the most drastic parts are likely to happen . Given the makeup of Congress , the prospects for cap-and-trade , voucherizing Medicare , the public option , and repealing `` Obamacare '' are all about the same . Which is to say , neither House progressives nor House Republicans will get their way .\nThese two documents represent the poles of what is possible . The House is America 's epicenter of drastic partisan divide . Republicans in the House are very fiscally conservative ; the House Progressive Caucus , the Democratic Party 's most liberal wing , is very liberal when it comes to spending on infrastructure and services .\nOver the next 10 years , Republicans and Democrats will agree on something in the middle .\nThese two visions also show us just how vastly different liberals and conservatives see the future , and how hard it will be for them to agree on anything that makes both sides happy . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "183": "( CNN ) - The Senate on Thursday easily passed a $ 1.1 trillion spending bill to fund the government through September and sent it to President Barack Obama , a notable departure from chronic , partisan-fueled budget battles in recent years that included the government shutdown last October .\nThe decisive vote , 72-to-26 , concluded congressional action that for the first time since 2012 determined federal spending agency by agency instead of through temporary stopgap measures that spotlighted the divisiveness in Washington .\nThe House approved the budget measure on Wednesday in another strong bipartisan vote , 359-to-67 .\n`` With very few exceptions we 've heard nothing but positive comments from my colleagues here in the Senate , '' Sen. Richard Shelby , an Alabama Republican , said on the Senate floor as the vote neared .\nDemocrats were just as eager to brag about the budget as an example of a Congress that can indeed function .\n`` These efforts show that we Democrats and Republicans can work together for the good of the country , '' said one of the people most responsible for the bill , Appropriations Committee Chairman Barbara Mikulski , a Maryland Democrat . `` We can avoid drama ... fiscal cliffs and shutdowns . ''\nThe sweeping bill hits nearly every corner of government . It includes a 1 percent pay increase for troops and a 1 percent cost-of-living boost for federal workers .\nIn recent years , must-pass funding bills have been flashpoints for epic battles over health care , the deficit and social policies from contraception to abortion .\nAs a result , Congress punted most key spending decisions by extending past funding bills , allowing sweeping spending cuts to take effect and failing to decide what agencies needed funding increasing and what ones needed cuts .\nBut following the government shutdown in October , Republican and Democratic leaders took a different approach following last October 's government shutdown , tempering partisan rhetoric in public and discussing compromise in private .\nDemocrats won - and Republicans conceded - on continued funding for Obamacare as well as large spending increases for Head Start and mental health programs .\nRepublicans gained - and Democrats lost - on continued budget cuts for the Environmental Protection Agency and the IRS .\n* Disabled veterans and some veteran 's families will be protected from a pension cut slated for younger military retirees .\n* Funding will increase and budget cuts will be reversed for : the FBI , mental health programs , the Army Corps of Engineers , cybersecurity programs , the Social Security Administration , Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health .\n* Budget-cut levels will continue for : Transportation Security Administration , the Department of Education , Department of Labor , and the Department of Housing and Urban Development .\n* The bill freezes a program to phase-out inefficient incandescent lightbulbs . Though manufactures have told CNN they make stop making the bills regardless .\n* Secretary of State John Kerry must certify that Libya is working to find those behind the deadly attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi in 2012 before before any funding can go to Tripoli .\n* The bill bans any spending on official portraits and freezes many top government salaries , including the Vice President 's .\nWhile the bill passed with bipartisan support in both chambers , not everyone was cheering .\n`` I can not support a funding bill that violates the only real progress we have made in getting our fiscal house in order over the past several years , '' Tennessee Republican Sen. Bob Corker wrote in a statement following his `` no '' vote .\nCorker and others questioned the bill 's use of long-term savings to increase spending over the next nine months .\nAnother source of anger : the relatively quick timeline from the unveiling of the bill late Monday to final passage Thursday .\n`` We were given but a day to review this 1,582 page document ... this reflects its own shortcomings , '' wrote South Carolina Republican Rep.

    "184": "Exclusive : Zeid Ra ’ ad al-Hussein , who steps down this month , says US president ’ s rhetoric echoes that of the worst eras of the 20th century\nDonald Trump ’ s anti-press rhetoric is “ very close to incitement to violence ” that would lead to journalists censoring themselves or being attacked , the outgoing UN human rights commissioner has said .\nZeid Ra ’ ad al-Hussein , a Jordanian prince and diplomat , is stepping down this month as UN high commissioner for human rights after deciding not to stand for a second four-year term , in the face of a waning commitment among world powers to fighting abuses .\nZeid said the Trump administration ’ s lack of concern about human rights marked a distinct break with previous administrations , and that Trump ’ s own rhetoric aimed at minorities and at the press was redolent of two of the worst eras of the 20th century , the run-up to the two world wars .\nIn an interview with ███ , he singled out the US president ’ s repeated designation of the press as “ the enemy of the people ” .\n“ We began to see a campaign against the media … that could have potentially , and still can , set in motion a chain of events which could quite easily lead to harm being inflicted on journalists just going about their work and potentially some self-censorship , ” Zeid said . “ And in that context , it ’ s getting very close to incitement to violence . ”\nHe said it would be up to a court but determine whether Trump was actually guilty of incitement depending on the circumstances , if say , a journalist was stabbed while covering a rally . He said Trump ’ s example was already being followed elsewhere , giving license to authoritarian leaders to crack down on the media in ways they had not previously dared to . Zeid pointed to the Cambodian leader , Hun Sen , who he said had used similar language when he closed down independent media organisations .\nIn the 20th century … feelings were stoked , directed at a vulnerable group for the sake of political gain Zeid Ra ’ ad al-Hussein\n“ The US creates a demonstration effect , which then is picked up by other countries where the leadership tends to to be more authoritarian [ in ] character or aspires to be authoritarian , ” he said .\nZeid has also taken on the Trump administration over its policy of separating children from their parents in migrant families arrested at the border , and Trump ’ s own long history of rhetoric aimed at minorities .\n“ When language is used in a way that focuses on groups of people who have traditionally suffered a great deal from bigotry and prejudice and chauvinism , it harked back to a period not too long ago in the 20th century when feelings were stoked , directed at a vulnerable group for the sake of political gain , ” he said , adding that he was referring in particular to the 1930s and the period before the first world war .\nZeid began his tenure as UN human rights commissioner in 2014 during the Obama administration and said his contacts with the state department dropped off significantly after Trump took office in January 2017 .\n“ The Trump administration seems to have separated itself from previous administrations in its upholding of human rights globally , ” Zeid said . The administration ’ s failure to appoint an ambassador to the Human Rights Council in Geneva , before withdrawing from the council altogether , he added , was “ illustrative of the lack of any deep commitment to the human rights ” .\nTimeline The Syrian war Show Hide Unprecedented protests demand civil liberties and the release of political prisoners after four decades of repressive rule by the Assad family . The regime represses demonstrations in Damascus and the southern city of Deraa but protests continue . Defecting army colonel Riad al-Asaad sets up the Turkey-based rebel Free Syrian Army . Islamist groups join the revolt . Regime forces take control of the rebel stronghold in Homs after a month of bombardment . Other bloody operations are carried out , notably in the central city of Hama , after massive anti-regime protests . More than 1,400 people die in a chemical weapon attack on rebel-held districts near Damascus . The US and Assad ally Russia agree a plan to eliminate Syria 's chemical weapons , averting punitive US strikes against the regime . Hostilities between jihadists and rebel groups turn into an open war in the north . The group that will become known as Islamic State takes Raqqa – the first provincial capital to fall out of regime control – from rebel forces . A US-led coalition launches airstrikes against Isis in Syria . The strikes benefit Kurdish groups , which since 2013 have run autonomous administrations in Kurdish-majority areas . Russia launches airstrikes in support of Assad 's troops , who are on the back foot . Russian firepower helps turn the tables for the regime , which begins to retake rebel-held territory . The regime retakes Syria 's second city , Aleppo . Russia and Iran , as backers of the Syrian regime , and Turkey , a supporter of the rebels , organise talks in Kazakhstan , between representatives of both sides . The process leads to the creation of four `` de-escalation zones '' . A sarin gas attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhun kills more than 80 people , prompting Washington to attack a regime airbase . Further complicating an already drawn-out conflict , Turkey launches an operation against the Kurdish People 's Protection Units which , with US support , played a key role in beating back Isis . Regime launches a ferocious assault on the remaining rebel-held enclave near Damascus , eastern Ghouta . In under four weeks , the Russian-backed onslaught kills more than 1,200 civilians .\nUS president Donald Trump surprises advisors and allies alike by declaring victory over the Islamic State and promising to withdraw US troops from the conflict . The Syrian Democratic Forces ( SDF ) announce that they have driven Isis out of their final stronghold of Baghuz . At least 11,000 SDF fighters , a Kurdish-led militia which includes Arab , Syriac and Turkmen units , have died in the four-year military campaign against the group in Syria . Britain and France agree to deploy additional special forces in Syria to allow the US to withdraw its ground troops from the fight against remaining Isis forces in the country . Rebels withdraw from Khan Sheikhun in north-west Syria , clearing the way for pro-government forces to enter the town – a key moment in the war for Idlib province , the country ’ s last major rebel stronghold .\nZeid has been an outspoken critic of governments around the world for their human rights records , but his tenure as high commissioner has coincided with the catastrophic failure of the UN Security Council to halt mass killings in Syria or Yemen , and the relegation of human rights as a priority at the UN in general , where it accounts for just 3 % of overall spending .\nA pivotal moment came in March when Zeid was blocked from even addressing the Security Council on human rights in Syria , where more than half a million people have been killed in seven years of violence .\nRussia and China were adamantly opposed but the French delegation was confident it had the nine votes necessary for the session to go ahead .\nHowever , with less than a minute to go and Zeid primed to speak , the ambassador from the Ivory Coast informed his French counterpart he had changed his mind and would abstain . The session was called off . The Ivorean government insisted that its diplomat , Bernard Tanoh-Boutchoue , had acted without its permission . Western diplomats became convinced that Tanoh-Boutchoue , who had previously served as ambassador to Moscow , had come under pressure from Russia to switch his vote , but the mystery was never resolved . The 67-year-old diplomat died in New York of a sudden illness , said to be a heart attack , a month after his controversial abstention .\nZeid said he never understood the machinations behind the vote , but said it reflected a broader trend .\nI would be very suspicious of any commissioner seeking a second term because I ’ d wonder what deals are being struck Zeid Ra ’ ad al-Hussein\n“ It tells me more about the weakening influence of the western powers that they could not secure nine votes for a briefing on human rights in Syria , ” he said . “ If you are discussing Syria in the security council and you are not discussing gross human rights violations , what are you discussing ? The latest arts and crafts fair in Damascus ? It ’ s ridiculous . ”\nZeid ’ s has often been a lonely voice . Hopes that the current secretary general , Antonio Guterres , would be more outspoken on human rights than his predecessor , have been dashed , a western diplomat at the UN said .\n“ There is a complete separation of what Zeid said and what the secretary general says , and his impact has been reduced because of that , ” the diplomat said . “ And there a broader problem of the ability of human rights abuses to shock and lead to a change of policy . That link has been broken . Actors who should have listened to Zeid , have not . ”\nZeid said he came to the decision early on in his tenure to speak out on human rights abuses irrespective of the political circumstances . He attributed his approach in part to his first major foreign mission as a UN official in his early 30s , when he witnessed first hand UN dithering and timidity during the fall of the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica , and the subsequent slaughter of some 8,000 men and boys by Bosnian Serb troops .\n“ We felt that there were periods of silence and that was painful for the UN and the UN was not respected ultimately by the parties to the conflict and therefore we saw the disasters that came from it , ” Zeid said . “ And … if the UN is not respected , the UN is rolled over to my mind . You don ’ t earn anyone ’ s respect by being silent . ”\nZeid ’ s advice to his successor , Michele Bachelet , who has been both a political prisoner and president in her native Chile , is to stay courageous and not to run for a second term .\n“ I would be very suspicious of any commissioner seeking a second term because I ’ d wonder what deals are being struck and if they ’ d been struck they ’ ve been struck on the back of victims , ” he said .\nThe job of bearing witness to crimes against humanity also takes an emotional toll . Zeid recalled a trip to Mexico to speak to the families of 43 students who were abducted and presumed murdered by a criminal gang in 2014 .\n“ I was listening to mothers and fathers , siblings , speak of those who were disappeared and presumably killed . After that , I had a series of interviews and I wasn ’ t in the right emotional state to actually give the interview because there was something deep within me where I felt I was a fraud , ” Zeid said . “ That given the enormity , the colossal nature of their suffering … with us they wanted salvation … they want an end to suffering . They want us to do something that is many respects almost impossible to do . That is where most of the pressure comes from in this job . ” \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

He said last September he was “ the guy who would take a bullet for the president ” and would “ never walk away ” .\nBut speaking to George Stephanopoulos in the ABC interview , conducted on Saturday at a hotel in New York City , he said : “ My wife , my daughter and my son have my first loyalty and always will .

    "187": "Washington ( CNN ) - The Supreme Court 's decision to uphold the national health care law may not have changed many minds regarding the controversial measure , but a new poll indicates it sure did change Americans views of the high court .\nAccording to a CNN/ORC International survey released Monday , the public is divided on last week 's ruling , with 50 % saying they agree with the Supreme Court 's decision and 49 % saying they disagree . And there is the expected partisan divide , with more than eight in ten Democrats agreeing with the decision , more than eight in ten Republicans disagreeing , and independent voters divided , with 52 % disagreeing and 47 % agreeing .\nThe poll was conducted Thursday through Sunday , entirely after the high court 's ruling on the Affordable Care Act .\n`` Despite howls of protest from many Republican leaders , only about one in five Americans - and only 35 % of the Republican rank and file - say they are angry about the decision , '' says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland . `` And despite victory laps by many Democratic leaders , only one in six Americans - and only one in three Democrats nationwide - say they feel enthusiastic about the court 's ruling . ''\nBut what have changed are perceptions of the high court . `` As recently as April , Republicans and Democrats had virtually identical positive opinions on the Supreme Court . But not any more , '' adds Holland . `` That 's the biggest change that the court decision has created . ''\nThe court 's approval rating among Democrats jumped by 23 points ; to 73 % . Among Republicans , it fell by 21 points , to 31 % . Approval of the Supreme Court among independents edged up five points , to 53 % .\nNot surprisingly , opinions of Chief Justice John Roberts are also divided along partisan lines , with a majority of Democrats holding a favorable view of him compared to only three in ten Republicans . But more than a third of all Americans are unsure how they view Roberts , probably a result of the low profile that he and his colleagues have kept for many years . Roberts sided with the liberals on the high court to uphold the law .\nOverall , three in ten say the high court is too liberal , with 22 % saying it 's too conservative and 46 % saying it 's about right .\nThe Republican led House of Representatives has scheduled a July 11th vote to attempt to repeal the health care law . The survey indicates that 51 % say Congress should repeal all provisions of the measure , with 47 % saying no .\nWhat about the individual mandate itself ? Forty-eight percent favor it and 51 % oppose the mandate . One thing that Americans do agree on is that the health insurance mandate is a tax , as ruled by the Supreme Court . Six in ten feel that way .\n`` But it is also worth noting that the number of Americans who favor all or most of the provisions in the bill has gone up a bit since last year , and despite roughly half looking to repeal all the provisions in the law , only one in eight say they oppose everything in the bill , '' says Holland .\nThe CNN poll was conducted by ORC International from 28-July 1 with 1,517 adult Americans questioned by telephone .

If you want to go far , go together. ’ There is no time when that is more true than today . We ’ re prepared to go with you , if you want us to . ”\nIn the first big event of African Leaders Summit held in Washington D.C. , Biden ’ s audience was made up of members of African non-profits and dignitaries gathered for a “ Civil Society Forum. ” He praised their courage in fighting for democracy in countries where activism is sometimes very dangerous .\n“ The future of Africa depends every bit of much on those of you who are part of the civil society as it does the leaders with whom the President and I will meet tomorrow , ” Biden said . “ No democracy can survive without the active and intense participation of its people . ”\nFor Biden , that means giving women the opportunities to be heard and wield power where in the past they have not .\n“ Its wasting half the initiative , half the brain power , half the passion , of a nation , ” Biden said , also acknowledging that the obstacles to gender equality in Africa seem daunting . “ That ’ s where you come in .. ”\nBiden also described what he sees as the foundations of a successful democratic society – one that is guided by the will of the people . He described how corruption in government , court systems and law enforcement can thwart a genuine democracy and tasked his audience with rooting it out .\n“ It ’ s a cancer in Africa as well as around the world . Widespread corruption is an affront to the dignity of its people , and a direct threat to each of your nations ’ stability , ” said Biden .\nThe Vice President used his own government as an example of how to defeat corruption – he described how the U.S. appoints permanent officials called Inspector Generals tasked with checking on the affairs of government organizations and investigating allegations of corruption .\n“ We ’ re not perfect , ” Biden admitted . “ We have these systems where we tend to find out where corruption lies and eventually get to it . So we ’ re prepared to work with you . ”\n“ In your hands , with your help , Africa can and will go so much further .

    "189": "Last year on the campaign trail , Donald Trump made a lot of promises , almost always adding that he planned to fulfill them `` quickly . '' He would say , `` We will defeat ISIS and we will do it very , very quickly , '' or `` We 're disrespected right now all over the world . But that will change very , very quickly . '' ( He was right about that one . It changed very quickly , but not for the better . )\nI will ask Congress to convene a special session so we can repeal and replace and it will be such an honor for me , for you and for everybody in this country , because Obamacare has to be replaced . And we will do it and we will do it very , very quickly .\nNo one understood why Trump would need to convene a special session of Congress but it sounded very forceful and `` strong '' ( another word he uses constantly ) . He got so grandiose in his promises to act quickly that at one point he pledged to get nearly his entire agenda done on the very first day .\nWhat his followers truly loved about him , of course , was that he was saying out loud all the politically incorrect things they felt inhibited from saying in polite company , for fear of someone thinking they are n't nice people . His candidacy , especially the rallies , provided one gigantic safe space for people to cheer for things that liberals hate . But when you asked people why they thought he would make a good president , it was always because he was a successful businessman who knew how to get things done .\nTrump 's entire pitch was based on his supposedly legendary ability to negotiate . He flogged `` The Art of the Deal '' like it was the Bible , signing it on rope lines for his adoring fans and constantly calling it the bestselling business book of all time . This was the myth underlying his reality TV `` Apprentice '' persona , which was inspired by the book .\nTrump was supposed to be a master negotiator who would singlehandedly cut new global trade deals to favor U.S. businesses and leave the rest of the world happily promising to pay more and get less . He would stare down world leaders and they would respect him for his manly strength and determination . He would bring Democrats and Republicans together in a room and bang their heads together until they came to an agreement . He was that good .\nDo I even need to say it ? None of that has worked out . The Republicans ca n't seem to get any legislation to Trump 's desk , and he has proven to be counterproductive whenever he gets involved . Not only has n't he lived up to the hype , he 's actually much worse at negotiating than any president in modern memory .\nGlenn Thrush and Jonathan Martin , reporting for the New York Times , examined why Trump ca n't seem to make any deals as president , and found that much of it is because of his terrible relationships with many Republican officials . Issuing crude threats against Republican senators who come out against him , as a Trump-allied Super PAC did this week when Sen. Dean Heller announced he would n't vote for the Senate health care bill , has been called `` beyond stupid '' by none other than Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell himself .\nA senator who supports the bill left the meeting at the White House with a sense that the president did not have a grasp of some basic elements of the Senate plan — and seemed especially confused when a moderate Republican complained that opponents of the bill would cast it as a massive tax break for the wealthy , according to an aide who received a detailed readout of the exchange .\nMr. Trump said he planned to tackle tax reform later , ignoring the repeal ’ s tax implications , the staff member added .\nIt is widely understood , including by its Republican authors , that the bill was a massive tax cut disguised as health care legislation . That the president did n't know that means he clearly had n't read the bill in any depth nor had he read the news media reports about it .\nWashington is n't the real estate and brand licensing world that Trump is used to . It 's clear that he 's in way over his head . But it 's worth remembering that there 's a lot of evidence that he was never very good at making deals .\nTony Schwartz , Trump 's ghostwriter on `` The Art of the Deal , '' came forward during the campaign to confess that most of what he 'd written in that book , which is the basis for the Trump myth , is just that -- a myth . Trump inherited a lot of money from his father , who had political juice in New York and co-signed Trump 's deals for years . He struggled for years , through bankruptcy and failed entrepreneurial ventures , managing to survive by finding new and novel ways to fund his lifestyle ( some of which are being investigated by the FBI and the special prosecutor right now ) . The `` Trump brand '' was slapped on any cheap consumer product he could persuade to take it .\nTrump 's particular problem in politics is that he has an extremely short attention span , which means that the learning curve for the presidency , which is steep for anyone , may just be too much for him to master . Schwartz told the New Yorker 's Jane Mayer that this problem has left Trump with “ a stunning level of superficial knowledge and plain ignorance , '' explaining , “ that ’ s why he so prefers TV as his first news source — information comes in easily digestible sound bites . ”\nIt 's impossible , Schwartz said , `` to keep [ Trump ] focussed on any topic , other than his own self-aggrandizement , for more than a few minutes , and even then ... if he had to be briefed on a crisis in the Situation Room , it ’ s impossible to imagine him paying attention over a long period of time . '' Schwartz described Trump as not a dealmaker at all but merely a self-promoter who craves “ money , praise , and celebrity '' and never gets enough of it . These are not unusual traits among leaders , but they are not sufficient or even necessary for the job he has now .\nTrump seems to have thought being president was a performance , like the fantasy role he played on `` The Apprentice . '' There 's a lot more to it than just holding photo-ops sitting behind a desk announcing something that you have n't read and do n't really understand . So far he has n't shown any evidence whatever that he 's up to the task . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "190": "In the clever science fiction video game Bioshock , an Objectivist business magnate named Andrew Ryan ( recognize those initials ? ) creates an underwater city , where the world 's elite members can flourish free from the controls of government . It is a utopian village that Ayn Rand and her hero John Galt would surely approve of , but unfortunately it ends up becoming a dystopian nightmare after class distinctions form ( what a shocker ) and technological innovation gets out of hand . It was a hell of a video game , for those of you into that kind of thing .\nBut I don ’ t bring up Bioshock to talk about video games . I bring it up because there is currently a similar movement happening in real life , and it is being funded by another rather eccentric businessman , the Paypal billionaire Peter Thiel . As some may already know , Thiel has teamed up with the grandson of libertarian icon Milton Friedman , Patri Friedman , to try and develop a “ seastead , ” or a permanent and autonomous dwelling at sea . Friedman formed the “ Seasteading Institute ” in 2008 , and Thiel has donated more than a million dollars to fund its creation .\nIt is all very utopian , to say the least . But on the website , they claim a floating city could be just years away . The real trick is finding a proper location to build this twenty-first century atlantis . Currently , they are attempting to find a host nation that will allow the floating city somewhat close to land , for the calm waters and ability to easily travel to and from the seastead .\nThe project has been coined “ libertarian island , ” and it reveals a building movement within Silicon Valley ; a sort of free market techno-capitalist faction that seems to come right out of Ayn Rand 's imagination . And as with all utopian ideologies , it is very appealing , especially when you live in a land where everything seems possible , with the proper technological advancements .\nTech billionaires like Thiel , Travis Kalanick and Marc Andressen , are leading the libertarian revolution in the land of computers , and it is not a surprising place for this laissez faire ideology to flourish . Silicon Valley is generally considered to have a laid back Californian culture , but behind all of the polite cordialities , there rests a necessary cutthroat attitude . A perfect example of this was Steve Jobs , who was so revered by the community , and much of the world , yet almost psychopathically merciless . The recent anti-trust case against the big tech companies like Google , Apple , and Intel , who colluded not to recruit each others employees , has even lead to speculation as to whether Jobs should be in jail today , if he were still alive .\nSo while Silicon Valley is no doubt a socially progressive place ( i.e . gay marriage ) , if one looks past social beliefs , there is as much ruthlessness as you ’ d expect in any capitalist industry . Look at the offshore tax avoidance , the despicable overseas working conditions , the outright violations of privacy and illegal behavior . There is a very real arrogance within Silicon Valley that seems to care little about rules and regulations .\nLibertarianism preaches a night-watchmen government that stays out of businesses way , and allows private industries to regulate themselves . It is a utopian ideology , as was communism , that has an almost religious-like faith in the free market , and an absolute distrust of any government . It is a perfect philosophy for a large corporation , like Apple , Google or Facebook . If we lived in an ideal libertarian society , these companies would not have to avoid taxes , because they would be non-existent , and they wouldn ’ t have to worry about annoying restrictions on privacy . In a libertarian society , these companies could regulate their own actions , and surely Google , with their famous “ Don ’ t be evil ” slogan , believes in corporate altruism .\nIn the Valley , innovation and entrepreneurship is everything , so a blind faith in the market is hardly shocking . And last year one of the leading libertarians , Rand Paul , flew out to San Francisco to speak at the Lincoln Labs Reboot Conference , held to “ create and support a community of like-minded individuals who desire to advance liberty in the public square with the use of technology. ” Paul said at the conference , “ use your ingenuity , use your big head to think of solutions the marketplace can figure out , that the idiots and trolls in Washington will never come up with , '' surely earning laughs and pats on the back .\nRand Paul has had one on one meetings with Mark Zuckerberg , and the floating island billionaire himself , Peter Thiel . The founder and CEO of Uber , Travis Kalanick is another noted libertarian , who used to have the cover of Ayn Rand ’ s “ The Fountainhead ” as his twitter icon . Kalanick runs Uber just as a devoted follower of Ayn Rand would , continuously fighting regulators and living by what writer Paul Carr has called the “ cult of disruption. ” Carr nicely summarizes the philosophy of this cult : “ In a digitally connected age , there ’ s absolutely no need for public carriage laws ( or hotel laws , or food safety laws , or… or… ) because the market will quickly move to drive out bad actors . If an Uber driver behaves badly , his low star rating will soon push him out of business . ”\nSo basically , with the internet , regulation has become nothing more than a outdated relic of the past , and today consumers truly have the power to make corporations behave by speaking out on social media , or providing negative ratings on Yelp , or filing a petition on Change.com , etc . It is the same old libertarian argument wrapped up in a new millennial cloak , that corporations will act ethically because if they don ’ t , consumers will go elsewhere .\nAs usual , it leaves out important realities that don ’ t sit well with the self-regulation myth . These realities include the irrationality and apathy of consumers , the lack of information available to consumers , and the overall secretive nature of corporations . The problem with self-regulation is that , consumers do not know what goes on at a corporation behind closed doors , so how would they force a company to act ethically if they are not aware of their misdeeds . Had the government not gone after Google for privacy violations , users would have never known . Google and other tech companies have a constant crave for innovation over everything , and bypass things like privacy when they get in its way . Would they control themselves had the government not stepped in ?\nAnother important truth is that many consumers usually continue willfully using products , even if a company has done something that is contrary to their moral beliefs . It is a sort of hypocritical selfishness where one puts comfort or convenience over ethics . Just look at Apple : everyone is aware of the appalling factory conditions and the tax avoidance , but that doesn ’ t stop many people from buying the latest iPhone .\nWhen looking at other industries , like oil and gas , the myth of self-regulation is even more comical . The famous oil billionaire Koch brothers , who are also fanatic libertarians , have knowingly avoided regulations , and have hurt people in the process . During the nineties , they were particularly careless , and the bottom line influenced every decision . When pipelines were in bad shape , they would determine whether fixing them or leaving them , and possibly paying off a lawsuit in the future , was more profitable . In 1996 , a pipeline that had been given the second treatment leaked butane into the air , and killed two teenagers who ignited it with the spark of their car ignition .\nEven if the consumers were completely rational and had access to all information , would it really be worth it to wait for companies to abide ? For example , many libertarians argue that legislation that made seat belts and airbags mandatory in all vehicles was pointless , because the free market would have eventually brought them anyways . But even if this were true , how long would it take , and how many lives could this inaction have caused ?\nThe most damning evidence against the myth of self regulation may very well be history . Before government regulatory agencies like the FDA came around , the safety of workers and consumers were both constantly at stake , as muckrakers like Upton Sinclair described so vividly . More recently , the lack of regulation in the financial industry , particularly in derivatives , contributed to one of the worst economic crises in history , and hurt many people in the process .\nLibertarians are uninterested in these realities , and believe that all government intervention is useless and stifles innovation , and it is the “ cult of innovation ” that makes the libertarian philosophy particularly popular in the technology obsessed Silicon Valley . In the their world , innovation is more important than privacy or safety , and the best and brightest should not have to play by the rules .\nWhile overall , Silicon Valley still supports the Democrats over Republicans , it would not be surprising to see a shift in the coming years . The libertarian philosophy is very attractive to those who worship technology and entrepreneurship , which is nearly all of the techies . And with millions of potential campaign dollars coming out of the valley , it could very well be a problematic territory for liberals in the future . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

They should have loved that . But they didn ’ t even bother to read it . You ’ re anti-crime , you must be anti-populist . ”\nBiden , who has not yet declared his candidacy , has struggled in the past week to deal with complaints from women that his hugs , kisses and other tactile shows of affection were unwelcome .

It ’ s crucial that the party nominate someone who can credibly represent its proudly diverse ranks . But it ’ s also important that the party not demand a degree of purity that nobody attains . ”\nIn February , the comedian Bill Maher urged viewers of his HBO show : “ No more swiping left on presidential candidates . Let ’ s give them a chance . Let ’ s not eat our own the way we nitpicked Hillary [ Clinton ] to death over her emails and other bullshit . ”\nMaher added : “ Kamala Harris has already had to play defence because it ’ s come out , when she was a prosecutor , she prosecuted people . Not very progressive . She should have found a way to apply more forgiveness , and the fact that she didn ’ t is unforgivable . Elizabeth Warren claimed to be Native American – so what ? Trump claimed to be human . ”\nRepublicans sense an opportunity to frame Democrats as consumed by identity politics and virtue signalling .\nRich Lowry , editor of the National Review , wrote in February : “ Democrats are about to ­embark on the first woke primary , a gantlet of political correctness that will routinely wring abject apologies out of candidates and find fault in even the most sure-footed . The passage of time will be no defense . Nor the best of intentions . Nor anything else . ”\nBut many on the left contend that the candidates ’ records are legitimate lines of inquiry and they should not be distracted by attacks from Trump , who is bound to paint them as socialists in any case .

    "192": "A veteran Democratic foreign policy adviser has accused Bill and Hillary Clinton of nepotism , dishonesty and vindictiveness in an assault on a previously untouched part of the Clinton political legacy – Ireland .\nTrina Vargo , who was a behind-the-scenes Washington player in Northern Ireland ’ s peace process , claims the couple tried to obtain a scholarship to Ireland for a boyfriend of their daughter , Chelsea , and later cut funding for the scholarship to punish Vargo for backing Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination race .\nVargo makes the allegations in a book , Shenanigans : the US-Ireland Relationship in Uncertain Times , published this week in the run-up to St Patrick ’ s Day celebrations .\nIt lifts the lid on what Vargo sees as inept , deluded and , at times , farcical efforts by Irish politicians and officials to tap the Irish diaspora and potential allies in Washington and Hollywood .\nVargo , who founded the US-Ireland Alliance , a Washington-based non-profit organisation , shuttled between the US capital , Dublin and Belfast for two decades while advising Sen Ted Kennedy and the Clinton and Obama administrations on Northern Ireland .\nHer portrait of the Clintons casts a shadow on a jewel of their foreign policy legacy , alleging pettiness and vengefulness after the historic peace-making of the 1998 Good Friday agreement .\nAngel Urena and Nick Merrill , spokespersons for the Clintons , defended the couple and rejected the book ’ s claims . “ Their legacy there is something they are incredibly proud of and one that is well documented . These accusations are baseless and patently false . ”\nVargo set up a scholarship named after George Mitchell , a former US senator who helped broker the agreement , in 1999 . It sends 12 US students to study in Ireland and Northern Ireland each year .\nVargo writes that in November 2000 Mitchell told her “ with some uneasiness ” that Bill Clinton , then nearing the end of his time in the White House , had phoned him to say he was “ very unhappy ” that Chelsea ’ s boyfriend had not been shortlisted from about 200 candidates despite a recommendation letter from the president .\nMitchell made clear he was not asking for the boyfriend ’ s inclusion , just seeking clarification . “ It would be hard to believe that the timing of the president ’ s call wasn ’ t aimed at influencing us to make him a finalist , ” writes Vargo .\nThe boyfriend remained off the shortlist , which Vargo believes put her on a path to joining the Clintons ’ “ enemies list ” .\nIn 2007 , Vargo advised Obama ’ s campaign on Ireland policy during his battle against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination . Clinton challenged her rival ’ s lack of experience and promoted her role in the peace process as first lady .\nClinton and her supporters grossly exaggerated her influence , says Vargo . “ The tall tales just kept growing … disregard for the truth was not invented , merely taken to new heights , by Donald Trump in the 2016 campaign . ”\nVargo helped Obama ’ s campaign to challenge the former first lady ’ s version , leading , she believes , to “ payback ” months later when Bill Clinton cancelled his attendance at a US-Ireland Alliance event in Belfast to celebrate the Good Friday agreement ’ s 10th anniversary .\nThere is no proof to back up the claim . An aide told Vargo a scheduling change was behind the decision and declined to elaborate .\nIn 2012 , the state department , then under Hillary Clinton , cut its annual $ 500,000 contribution to the Mitchell scholarship , citing budgetary measures . “ The elimination of funding … was not about the money , ” Vargo writes .\nThe Clintons ’ spokespersons said Clinton ’ s successor , John Kerry , also cut funding . “ Both [ were ] the product of a constant battle with a Republican Congress to fight for diplomatic and development dollars , there is nothing more to it than that . ”\nSince 2015 , Vargo has filed freedom of information requests to clarify the reason for the funding cut , supplying a list of names to the state department , but has only received documents with other , lower-level names .\nThe book also levels accusations at Irish politicians and officials . Successive Irish governments brought a “ begging bowl ” mentality to Washington by seeking funding for peace process initiatives long past their sell-by date , she says .\nThey also made clumsy efforts to tap the diaspora , such as creating the “ certificate of Irishness ” , a scheme scrapped for lack of interest in 2015 , and annoyed Latinos and other groups in the US by unsuccessfully seeking special deals for Irish immigrants . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

John Barrasso said Sunday the country should be prepared for the sequester and its massive spending cuts to kick in next month , despite Democrats ' proposal last week to avert it .\n`` Let me be very clear - and I 'd say this to the president as I say it to you - these spending cuts are going to go through on March 1 , '' the senator from Wyoming said on CNN 's `` State of the Union . ''\nThe across-the-board cuts aimed to reduce the deficit by $ 1.2 trillion over the next decade were supposed to be triggered at the beginning of the year . In the scaled-back fiscal cliff bill , however , Congress managed to postpone the cuts by two months .\nWith less than two weeks to go , lawmakers face another countdown before the largely dreaded cuts are scheduled to begin . Senate Democrats on Thursday proposed a $ 110 billion measure to once again delay the cuts .\nDemocrats want to replace the budget cuts , which Pentagon officials say will have drastic effects on the military , with a combination of increased tax revenue from millionaires through the closing of loopholes , ending agriculture subsidies , and reducing defense spending after the war in Afghanistan ends .\nBut Barrasso , along with other Republicans in the Senate , was not so pleased with the proposal , especially the provision dealing with tax revenue .\n`` Taxes are off the table , '' he told CNN 's chief political correspondent Candy Crowley . `` The American people need to know tax cuts are off the table and the Republican Party is not in any way going to trade spending cuts for a tax increase . ''\nThe senator said there are `` much better ways to do these budget cuts , '' though he did not mention specific proposals .\nPresident Barack Obama vowed during his re-election campaign that the sequester will not happen , and he called on Congress earlier this month to pass a short-term measure to put off the cuts .\nBut when his chief of staff , Denis McDonough , was questioned about it Sunday morning , McDonough sounded less certain the sequester would be prevented .\n`` I sure hope it does n't ( happen ) , '' he said on NBC 's `` Meet the Press .

    "194": "Donald Trump directed Michael Cohen to arrange hush-money payments with two women because then-candidate Trump “ was very concerned about how this would affect the election ” if their allegations of affairs became public , the president ’ s former personal attorney said in an exclusive interview with ███ .\nInterested in Donald Trump ? Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news , video , and analysis from ███ . Add Interest\nCohen ’ s comments are his first since being sentenced earlier this week to three years in federal prison for financial crimes , lying to Congress and two campaign finance violations in connection with the deals with the women , Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels , who claim past affairs with Trump .\n“ I knew what I was doing was wrong , ” Cohen told ███ ’ Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos . “ I stood up before the world [ Wednesday ] and I accepted the responsibility for my actions . ”\nWhen asked if the president also knew it was wrong to make the payments , Cohen replied , “ Of course , ” adding that the purpose was to “ help [ Trump ] and his campaign . ”\nCohen said he is “ angry at himself ” for his role in the deals , but that he did it out of “ blind loyalty ” to Trump .\n“ I gave loyalty to someone who , truthfully , does not deserve loyalty , ” he said .\nFederal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York have implicated , but not charged , the president in the deals reached in the closing weeks of the 2016 election . They allege that Cohen acted “ in coordination with and at the direction of ” Trump , according to court filings . Prosecutors also reached a non-prosecution agreement with AMI , the publishers of the National Inquirer , in which the tabloid admitted to making a $ 150,000 payment to McDougal “ in concert ” with the Trump campaign .\nThe president has denied allegations of the affairs -- but has had shifting explanations about when he learned about the payments to the women . He has also contended that the deals were private and unrelated to the campaign and that if anything illegal occurred , it was Cohen ’ s responsibility .\nTrump has lashed out at Cohen since his sentencing , contending in a Thursday tweet that his former close confidant only agreed to plead guilty “ in order to embarrass the president and get a much reduced prison sentence , which he did . ”\n“ It is absolutely not true , ” Cohen said . “ Under no circumstances do I want to embarrass the president . He knows the truth . I know the truth . ”\nCohen was particularly distressed by another Trump tweet on Thursday , in which the president implied that prosecutors investigating Cohen had let his wife and father-in-law off the hook .\n“ Instead of him taking responsibility for his actions , what does he do ? ” Cohen said . “ He attacks my family . ”\nAnd Cohen refuted the president ’ s contention that he never directed Cohen to do anything wrong .\n“ I do n't think there is anybody that believes that , ” Cohen told Stephanopoulos . “ First of all , nothing at the Trump organization was ever done unless it was run through Mr. Trump . He directed me to make the payments , he directed me to become involved in these matters .\n“ He knows the truth . I know the truth . Others know the truth , ” Cohen continued . “ And here is the truth : People of the United States of America , people of the world , do n't believe what he is saying . The man does n't tell the truth . And it is sad that I should take responsibility for his dirty deeds . ”\nWhen confronted about his convictions for lying to Congress and for tax evasion and banking crimes , Cohen said he was “ done with the lying . I am done being loyal to President Trump and my first loyalty belongs to my wife , my daughter , my son and this country . ”\n“ Because the special counsel stated emphatically that the information that I gave to them is credible and helpful , ” Cohen replied . “ There ’ s a substantial amount of information that they possessed that corroborates the fact that I am telling the truth . ”\nCohen -- who is due to report to prison on March 6 -- has professed his willingness to continue to answer questions for special counsel Robert Mueller and other federal and state investigators .\nHe declined in the interview to answer specific questions about the Mueller investigation “ out of respect for process . ”\n“ I don ’ t want to jeopardize any of their investigations , ” he said .\nBut when asked if he thinks the president is telling the truth about the Russia probe , Cohen replied simply , “ No . ”\nCohen once said he would “ take a bullet ” for the president , but now he finds himself opposing the president and facing the prospect of becoming a witness against him .\n“ It ’ s never good to be on the wrong side of the president of the United States of America , but somehow or another this task has now fallen onto my shoulders and as I also stated ... I will spend the rest of my life in order to fix the mistake that I made . ”\nCohen said as he observes Trump ’ s actions in the White House , he barely recognizes the man he served for more than a decade at the Trump organization .\n“ He ’ s a very different individual , ” Cohen said . “ I think the pressure of the job is much more than what he thought it was going to be . It ’ s not like the Trump organization where he would bark out orders and people would blindly follow what he wanted done . There ’ s a system here ; he doesn ’ t understand the system and it ’ s sad because the country has never been more divisive and one of the hopes that I have out of the punishment that I ’ ve received as well as the cooperation that I have given I will be remembered in history as helping to bring this country back together .\n“ I will not be the villain of his story , ” he said . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "195": "Nearly two decades before last month 's murders of New York police officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu by a black man , the murder of a black NYPD officer , Charles Davis , anticipated claims we 're hearing that police-community problems aren ’ t really “ black and white ” and the only color that really counts is blue .\nYet the problems do remain “ black and white ” for reasons of economic exploitation and isolation that run deeper than race itself and that are gathering force , despite rising numbers of white/Asian and white/Hispanic marriages and of multiracial children , even in the families of police officers themselves . Unless we can face the reasons why more `` diversity '' in police ranks is a far-from-sufficient condition of justice , American society will remain more racist than many others , and thereby hangs my tale .\nShortly before Christmas 1996 in the lower-middle-class Queens neighborhood of East Elmhurst , robbers killed Officer Davis as he tried to protect Ira Epstein , the white owner of a check-cashing store where Davis was moonlighting as a security guard to earn extra money to buy holiday gifts for his 6-year-old daughter , Arielle .\nBecause Davis was off-duty at the time , it ’ s unclear if his assailants knew that he was a police officer . But because he was one and was murdered for doing what police officers do , his Episcopal funeral Mass in Garden City , Long Island , was a familiar “ tableau of pomp and grief , ” as the New York Times put it , with thousands of saluting , white-gloved , white-ethnic officers and a flyover by police helicopters .\n“ Arielle , your daddy , who loved you , who adored you…will always be a hero of New York City , ” Mayor Rudolph Giuliani told Davis ’ daughter from the church pulpit . He asked the congregation to give Arielle something she would remember , and all present responded with a long , wrenching ovation . Noting that Ira Epstein ’ s widow had called Davis a role model for the city ’ s youth , Giuliani said , “ She was right , ” adding that , “ When [ Davis ] died Saturday morning he was doing what he was trained to do – he was trying to protect another man . ''\nMany funerals of New York City police officers killed in action have been tableaus not only of pomp and grief but of the chasm that yawns between an “ occupying army ” of mostly white-ethnic officers and an “ underclass ” of inner-city , black and Hispanic men . I spent enough time there in the late 1970s to have wished that the sea of blue around Davis ’ funeral -- and now those of officers Ramos and Liu -- would signify something better than a chasm .\nBut does it ? Or have the examples set by Davis , Liu and Ramos on police forces given the rest of us excuses to rationalize the continuing , calculated , heavily policed and seemingly bottomless isolation of millions of black and Hispanic men and women ? Are economic isolation and social stigmatization still driving some of the isolated -- and those who police them -- so crazy that it 's a wonder there aren ’ t even more police killers like those who killed Davis , Liu and Ramos ?\nRamos and Wu ’ s killer , Ismaaiyl Brinsley , was a perversely politicized , vengeance-crazed black man . Even the slaying in Ferguson of an unarmed black man , Michael Brown , by white officer Darren Wilson has a symbolic but no less telling opposite ( Wilson ’ s nightmare ) in another Ferguson – Colin Ferguson , a perversely politicized , vengeance-crazed black man who , shortly before Christmas , 1993 , boarded a suburban Long Island commuter train and shot 23 white passengers , killing six .\nAlthough he killed no cops , many New York officers live on Long Island , whose suburban towns their parents or grandparents chose over New York City ’ s tenements and row homes in the 1960s while seeking greener pastures in the booming , postwar economy and insulation from racially changing inner-city neighborhoods and rising black crime . As Newsday ’ s Jimmy Breslin put it a day after Ferguson ’ s train massacre : “ Last night , Brooklyn followed them home . ”\nAre these officers and prosecutors to blame for provoking their killers ’ isolation and rage ? Or are they really doing only what our democracy seemingly wants and expects them to do : keep the lid on blacks and Hispanics who are cheated and sidelined , as the rest of us look the other way and disclaim responsibility – an evasion that seems easier to some whenever a Brinsley or a Colin Ferguson explodes ?\nIn a strange irony , Charles Davis probably reinforced white innocence because he was a generous cop , popular with other officers and with residents of the Queens neighborhood where he supervised youth basketball games and a club for kids who might want to join the NYPD . His large presence , sharp eye and caring strengthened the community policing that had helped to cut New York City ’ s murder rate in half in less than five years , to below 1,000 for the first time in three decades . ( By 2013 , that number would plummet to just over 300 , and this year it may be even lower , notwithstanding predictable predictions of doom 11 months ago by Rupert Murdoch ’ s New York Post and the Patrolmen ’ s Benevolent Association that Mayor Bill De Blasio ’ s curbing of excessive NYPD “ stop and frisk ” practices would unleash mayhem . )\nBut if Davis ' blue uniform and the blue sea at his funeral signified something better than black-versus-white , that equation took a perverse turn as Queens District Attorney Richard Brown orchestrated the indictment of 19-year-old George Bell , a stock boy at Old Navy who lived with his mother and had no criminal background , and two other black men , as Davis ’ killers . A recent Nation magazine review of the case by Hannah Riley , a former researcher at the Innocence Project and a student of criminology at the University of Cambridge , raises serious doubts that the men convicted and still in prison for killing Davis were really his murderers .\nD.A . Brown ’ s zeal in convicting them may have been fortified by the fact that Davis ’ wife had been an assistant district attorney , albeit in another jurisdiction . But all prosecutors who face high-profile , highly charged cases have other , more-powerful incentives to “ resolve ” them irresponsibly . New Yorkers would be reminded of that in 2002 , when the four black men and one Hispanic man who 'd been convicted and imprisoned in 1989 amid public outrage over the infamous assault and rape of the Central Park Jogger were released after years of unjustified incarceration after the real assailant confessed .\nSuch things happen partly because D.A.s win reelection by pandering to angry , frightened voters ' hunger for revenge and because police officers are literally the prosecutors ’ comrades in arms and their witnesses before grand juries and in open trials . ( The over-zealous assistant prosecutors and detectives complicit in both the Central Park jogger and Davis cases were women , by the way . ) But Hannah Riley has found a would-be whistle-blower in retired NYPD detective Pete Fiorillo , who had been pleased at first to see Giuliani touting the work of other detectives in the case and who 'd had , as he put it , “ no intention of looking at it for the purpose of taking it apart . ”\n“ But the more he learned , ” Riley explains , “ the more his doubts grew until he became convinced that the investigation and trial were irredeemably flawed . ‘ This case represents a total breakdown of the criminal justice system from the bottom to the top : the police that investigated this case ; the DA that prosecuted the case ; the judge that tried all three cases , ’ said Fiorillo . ‘ They just didn ’ t have the courage to do the right thing . ’ ”\nGiuliani , himself an infamously zealous former prosecutor , told the public after Davis ’ murder that , “ If you shoot and kill a New York City police officer , the Police Department is going to catch you , they ’ re going to find you , usually in a short period of time , and then at a minimum you ’ re going to spend the rest of your life in jail . And in this particular situation , it ’ s quite possible you ’ ll get executed . ”\nThe word “ execution ” had a dark double-entendre here , giving the “ blue over black ” equation another perverse twist : Prosecutorial railroading involves not only beguiling or coercing helpless and apparently hopeless young black and Hispanic men into confessions and eventual convictions , and not just complicity by grand juries whose secrecy sanitizes such orchestrations . It also involves finding excuses for officers who are spared indictment time and again -- even after summarily executing unarmed and even unresisting black and Hispanic men and , in some cases , women .\nLike most New Yorkers watching the Central Park and Davis cases , I was inclined to trust prosecutors and to assume the justice of the convictions . When reporters on the Davis murder were told that the 19-year-old Bell had been heard humming the song , “ Have Yourself a Very Merry Christmas ” during a break in the questioning at the 109th Precinct and that remorse seemed never to enter his mind , I assumed that he was yet another half-crazed casualty of inner-city isolation , the kind of casualty I ’ d encountered more than once .\nIn the late 1970s I ran a weekly newspaper serving poor neighborhoods just across Brooklyn ’ s Broadway and Flushing Avenue from Bedford-Stuyvesant , where Officers Ramos and Liu were killed ; I made more than a few visits to the Tompkins Houses along Myrtle Avenue , outside of which the murders occurred , and to Woodhull Hospital , where they were brought with Brinsley , who committed suicide nearby . Just to the northeast lay Bushwick , a once-tidy , German and Italian white-ethnic neighborhood that had become mostly Hispanic and black in the 1960s in ways and for reasons I knew intimately and that I portray in my book `` The Closest of Strangers , '' two of whose chapters chronicle North Brooklyn ’ s ravaging by absentee landlords ’ “ block-busting ” welfare-subsidy scams , rampant arson for profit and for revenge , and massive looting during a huge 1977 power blackout .\nOn two occasions I navigated the devastation all night with officers of Bushwick ’ s 83rd Precinct , accompanying them into scenes of domestic violence where terrified toddlers sucking on teething rings crawled across shattered plates and splattered dinners to hide behind sofas as their mothers told us why they ’ d called 911 out of desperation and sometimes for revenge . Sometimes the man was still there , and officers had to take him outside .\nOut on the street in the noisy , sulfurous darkness , a black-Hispanic youth sauntered up to the patrol car ’ s open window and taunted one of my hosts by asking , “ You Officer Torsney ? Gon na shoot me ? ” -- referring to Robert Torsney , who on Thanksgiving Day in 1976 , for no apparent reason , had fired a bullet into the head of Randolph Evans , 15 , a ninth grader at Franklin K. Lane High School , outside the Cypress Hills housing project , near where Officer Rafael Ramos was buried last Saturday .\nAs New York Times columnist Bob Herbert noted years later , “ Torsney would later claim he had been afflicted with a rare form of epilepsy that , remarkably , had never been noticed before the killing and was never seen after it . The ‘ epilepsy ’ defense worked . Officer Torsney was acquitted of any wrongdoing . ”\nHerbert ’ s column , “ The Sickness in the NYPD , '' is worth reading , if only for the experience of rubbing your eyes in disbelief . Another of its offerings :\n“ One April morning in 1973 a veteran police officer named Thomas Shea pulled his service revolver and blew away a young black boy on a street in Jamaica , Queens . He shot the kid in the back . There was no chance of survival . Afterward , no one could figure out why the officer had done it . There was no reason for the shooting , no threat to Officer Shea of any kind . The boy 's name was Clifford Glover and he was 10 years old . Officer Shea was charged with murder but of course he was acquitted . ”\nFor every young man whom killers in uniform execute as unambiguously as they did Randy Evans , Clifford Glover , Eric Garner and many others without being indicted for it , still more essentially hapless , helpless people are packed off into the vast archipelago of incarceration that employs thousands of “ corrections ” officers . Either way , for the rest of us , it ’ s out of sight , out of mind , as were the hundreds of homeless people and derelicts about whom few New Yorkers asked when they disappeared from Manhattan ’ s streets during Giuliani ’ s mayoralty .\nIf at the bottom of it all is the calculated isolation and impoverishment of blacks and Hispanics that I chronicled while climbing stairwells in Brooklyn ’ s Bushwick-Hylan and Borinquen Plaza housing projects to distribute our paper , next to that bottom are the cops we assign to keep the lid on it . Is it a wonder that they sometimes say that they feel like “ garbage collectors ” and that , when the “ garbage ” call them something worse , some of them explode ?\nIn the 1960s , insouciant , pseudo-insurgent , middle-class white youths called cops “ pigs. ” A police union took out an ad saying , “ Next time you really need help , try calling a pig. ” But , with a very few , spectacular exceptions like the Brinks armored car robbery , the worst thing that white kids did to cops in those days was call them names . Is it really surprising that some cops and corrections officers feel as trapped in neighborhoods like Bushwick as the people they ’ re charged with containing ?\nIs it surprising that some of the young white men who are drawn to such work grew up marinating what I described here three weeks ago as ressentiment , the social pathology of a society that has begun to countenance torture abroad and the militarization of police at home against a decadent , demoralized populace that has come to include themselves ?\nOr that , at the funeral of Rafael Ramos , stunted citizens like these would turn their backs on the chief executive of the democracy that employs them , and that they would thereby dishonor the fallen officer and flout civilian leadership of the police and the military as if they would prefer a police state ?\nThe surprise is that so many police officers are still as good as Davis and as the relatives of ███ ’ s own Joan Walsh , as she recounted here vividly this week and in her book `` What 's the Matter With White People ? ''\nI , too , can testify that there are many officers , of all colors and backgrounds , as generous and effective as Charles Davis . In the mid-1990s , Peter Mancuso , a former NYPD sergeant , Marine combat veteran , and longtime police reformer , introduced me to other impressive colleagues while I was a columnist for the New York Daily News , a paper many cops read while sitting in their patrol cars . The officers I met were better , more proactive citizen-leaders than moralists who simply cluck their tongues at them .\nOn the other hand , whenever I wrote columns like this one praising their reform efforts , I got some unexpected visits from the New York Fire Department , whose firefighters banged loudly on my door at 3 a.m. because someone had called in a false alarm a day or two after the column ran .\nSoon after the chokehold killing of Eric Garner , but before the assassinations of Liu and Ramos , another retired police officer sent me this video , distributed by anonymous officers who seem to be preparing for race war , that depicts black men maiming and murdering cops in realistic street scenes . Some of the scenes look staged , but if Brinsley ’ s real deed had been filmed it would have fit perfectly into this alarmist , racist montage .\nThe officer who shared it with me calls it “ almost a counter-training device . Its message is , ‘ Never mind what we are about to tell you the law says ; here is what you are up against at any moment. ’ After seeing it , I can better understand that young Housing Division Officer opening stairwell doors with his gun in his hand [ and , trigger-happy , shot and killed an unarmed , innocent 28-year-old black man two floors below him ] . I 'm wondering if he saw the video or something like it. ’ ” ( Before calling 911 to aid the man he ’ d shot , the housing officer called his union . ) Officers ’ testimony in cases like this and Eric Garner ’ s and Randy Evans ’ and Clifford Glover ’ s and the rest is almost transparently scripted by the union .\nAnother irony . Even as the rogue video and the real deeds of Brinsley and Colin Ferguson alarm us , and even as some officers ’ turning their backs on the mayor at a funeral and a police graduation ceremony disgust us , many black leaders have been ascending a far-better learning curve from the demagoguery of the 1980s and ‘ 90s to more sophisticated , humane strategizing .\nWhere now are the Louis Farrakhans , the Vernon Masons and Alton Maddoxes ( lawyers of Tawana Brawley infamy ) and the Johnnie Cochrans , whose verbal threats and courtroom tactics sent chills down whites ’ spines ? Al Sharpton , whom I knew well in those years and described here in November , has climbed that learning curve : He said that the Ferguson , Missouri , protest movement “ was not about Darren Wilson ’ s job . It was about Michael Brown ’ s justice… . We are not anti-police . If our children are wrong , arrest them . Don ’ t empty your gun and act like you had no other way. ” Sharpton also led Eric Garner ’ s family in protesting Brinsley ’ s deed and mourning the deaths of officers Ramos and Liu .\nSharpton is a flawed leader , but efforts by Fox News ’ flunkies to blame him and recent protesters for bad relations with police prove only that black leadership ’ s learning curve has been offset by some white male degeneration along the lines I sketched here .\nThe glorious funerals given officers Davis , Liu and Ramos don ’ t dispel these white men ’ s growing bewilderment , fear and anger , less of it generated by black men than by economic and cultural riptides that would still dispossess and disorient many of them even if the U.S. were white from coast to coast .\nTo overcome racism , we ’ ll have to reach past “ black and white ” story lines and find strategies that free the oppressed by freeing the oppressor . Police are trapped in the swamp I navigated in Brooklyn because all of us are trapped in a political economy that ’ s no longer legitimate or sustainable . Unless we confront what Joan Walsh is telling us has happened to the white working and middle classes , and what AlterNet editor Don Hazen , economist James Galbraith and historian Eli Zaretsky are trying to tell us about the real roots of America ’ s white male problem , “ black and white ” explanations will fall short , on both sides of an enduring race line that leads us nowhere . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

She said Republican strategist Karl Rove ’ s public speculation that Clinton might have brain damage is “ pathetic . ”\n“ She ’ s in the prime of her political life , ” Feinstein said .\nOn “ Fox News Sunday , ” Rove said the Clintons are hypocritical for crying foul .\n“ I love President Clinton ’ s comments the other day , ” Rove said . “ Let ’ s remember , this is a guy who ran for office savaging Bob Dole . ”\n“ I love being lectured by Bill Clinton , ” Rove said sarcastically .\nBill Clinton didn ’ t necessarily lecture Rove , but he did defend his wife last week , saying she is “ strong. ” But the former president might have made the situation worse for his wife by saying she had a “ terrible ” concussion that took six months to get over . That is the first time anyone from her team has said it was a six-month recovery .\n“ Karl Rove is struggling to be relevant , ” Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri shot back on NBC ’ s “ Meet the Press , ” calling the former Bush adviser ’ s super PAC , which spent more than $ 175 million trying to elect Republican Mitt Romney , an “ abject failure . ”\nMcCaskill - who has had a complicated relationship with Hillary Clinton ever since the 2008 campaign , when she backed Clinton ’ s challenger , then-Sen. Barack Obama - called Rove ’ s remarks “ a cheap political shot . ”\nWhile the Rove talking point was a central point of discussion , Republicans on the talk shows didn ’ t jump to defend him .\nFormer New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg , Democrat-turned-Republican-turned-Independent , said on CBS News ’ “ Face the Nation ” that Rove ’ s remarks were “ outrageous and over the pale . ”\nOn Fox , former Vice President Dick Cheney - who has had severe health problems , including five heart attacks - didn ’ t question Clinton ’ s health but said , “ Any presidential candidate … is going to have to answer questions about their health . ”\nCheney ’ s take was similar to the one by Reince Priebus , head of the Republican National Committee , but neither refused an opportunity to criticize Clinton - which brings us to Benghazi .\nBenghazi : “ I think she clearly bears responsibility for whatever the State Department did or didn ’ t know about it , ” Cheney said about Clinton and the 2012 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi , Libya . “ I do think it ’ s a major issue . I don ’ t think we ’ ve heard the last of it yet . ”\nPriebus said Clinton ’ s health isn ’ t an issue for him , but that she “ is trying to sweep Benghazi under the rug . ”\nDemocrats , who have dismissed Republicans ’ ongoing attempts to find more damaging information on Benghazi , played down the GOP ’ s criticisms again .\nMcCaskill again defended Clinton with a huge compliment - perhaps a public attempt at mending their relationship with a slight against Obama : “ She has got the strongest resume for president of anyone who had run in a very long time . ”\nFeinstein said the special committee on Benghazi launched by House Republicans is “ ridiculous . ”\n“ It ’ s a hunting mission for a lynch mob , ” she said on “ State of the Union. ” She pointed to the previous four reports , numerous hearings , and thousand-page document reviews as proof that there is nothing left to uncover .\nBut Republicans know that keeping Benghazi in the spotlight could , at best , peel away at Clinton ’ s favorability and , at worst , implicate her for her role . Given that , Priebus was out with a bold prediction : “ Given the month she just had , I actually doubt very much whether she actually will run for president in 2016 . ”\nOn @ meetthepress @ GOP chair @ Reince says @ HillaryClinton probably wo n't run if she has another month like the last one — Sean Spicer ( @ seanspicer ) May 18 , 2014\nThe VA : Amid the growing scandal about wait times and care at veterans ' hospitals , President Obama 's chief of staff , Dennis McDonough , said the President is `` madder than hell and I have got the scars to prove it .

    "197": "Where things stand : Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid introduced the continuing resolution in the Senate on Monday afternoon . Sen. Ted Cruz , R-Texas , asked Reid to consider two procedural maneuvers : The first was to unanimously agree to pass the House-approved resolution , which removes funding for Obamacare , and the second was to require a 60-vote threshold for any amendments . Reid objected to both requests and later in the day filed cloture on the motion to proceed , setting up the first filibuster vote for Wednesday .\nWho 's saying what : After Reid shot down his requests , Cruz tried to turn the tables on Reid , arguing that the majority leader 's objections were what 's pushing the government closer to a shutdown . `` Five minutes ago , the Senate could have acted to prevent a government shutdown , '' Cruz said Monday . `` But unfortunately , the majority leader chose to object and to say no . He would rather risk a government shutdown than act to prevent it . ''\nAnd Cruz warned his Republican colleagues that a vote in favor of cloture `` will be voting to allow the majority leader to fund Obamacare on 51 votes . ''\nBut shortly after Cruz tried to rally his Republican colleagues to vote against cloture , a spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that McConnell would not support Cruz 's filibuster push . Instead , the Kentucky Republican , along with the Senate 's No . 2 Republican Sen. John Cornyn , R-Texas , said they would not block a bill that would defund Obamacare . Translation : They will vote in favor of cloture , since they support the House resolution , but they 'll ultimately vote against the final Senate amended resolution .\nWhere things are heading : Let 's just say it 's going to be a long week in the Senate . Cruz has vowed to use every procedural measure available to him , including a filibuster , to try to keep the Senate from stripping the defund Obamacare language from the CR , so it is expected that this vote will go down to the wire . Here 's a look at how things might shake out over the next few days .\nThe Senate will hold votes on some judicial nominees in the morning before heading to the weekly caucus lunches . Later in the afternoon , it will keep an eye on the Senate floor for Cruz , who is expected to speak and could lay out his plans moving forward .\nThe Senate will have its first test vote when it votes to end debate on the motion to proceed , which will require 60 votes to pass . Reid has indicated this vote would occur no later than noon . If the vote passes , a 30-hour clock would start before the Senate can vote on a motion to proceed .\nAt the end of the 30 hours , the Senate will vote on the motion to proceed . At this time , Reid can file the amendment that would strip the Obamacare defunding language from the bill . Reid would then file cloture on the resolution , setting up a vote to end debate for Saturday .\nThis is a day of debate during which Cruz could launch a filibuster to try to keep the Senate from taking out the defund Obamacare language .\nThe Senate will vote to end debate on the resolution , which will require 60 votes . The 30- hour clock would then start , allowing for the final votes to occur on Sunday .\nThe Senate will hold two votes on Sunday . The first would be to approve the amendment that would strip the defunding language from the CR , and the second would be on final passage of the bill , at which point it would be sent back to the House . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "198": "News that the Vatican has officially recognized Palestinian statehood in a new treaty may have less of an impact on the relationship between the Holy See and Palestine than on the already fraught relationship between Pope Francis and an increasingly disgruntled Catholic and evangelical right here in the U.S .\nThat ’ s because Rome ’ s diplomatic recognition of Palestine , while made official on Wednesday , has been proceeding quietly behind the scenes for some time . The Vatican has referred to the “ state of Palestine ” unofficially since the UN recognized the Palestinian state in 2012 . “ We have recognized the State of Palestine ever since it was given recognition by the United Nations and it is already listed as the State of Palestine in our official yearbook , '' said Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi .\nThe treaty itself , which is expected to be signed shortly , “ deals with essential aspects of the life and activity of the Catholic Church in Palestine , ” such as the status of Catholic Church properties and charities .\nThe larger significance of the Vatican ’ s move is the signal it sends to the international community about the recognition of Palestinian statehood . Not surprisingly , the fact that the Vatican appears to be putting its moral authority—and Pope Francis ’ immense personal popularity—behind recognition of the Palestinian state didn ’ t sit well with backers of Israel .\nA senior Israeli official told the New York Times the move would damage the stalled Middle East peace process . David Harris , head of the American Jewish Committee , called the move `` unhelpful , '' saying , “ Formal Vatican recognition of Palestine , a state that , in reality , does not yet exist , is a regrettable move , counterproductive to all who seek true peace between Israel and the Palestinians . ”\nBut equally likely to be disgruntled are conservative Catholics and evangelicals , many of whom are strong supporters of Israel because of what they believe will be its pivotal role in biblical end-times and oppose the recognition of Palestinian statehood and the changing of any borders in the region that that would likely entail .\nThese religious conservatives have already seen Pope Francis tip the scale in international relations—away from their preferred direction—when he brokered a deal to restore diplomatic relations between the U.S. and still officially communist Cuba . He ’ s also trashed free-market capitalism , decrying the “ idolatry of money ” and trickle-down economics . And his soon-to-be released encyclical on the environment is likely to frame tackling climate change in terms of a deep moral responsibility to future generations .\nNow , conservatives will feel they ’ ve lost the support of the Vatican on another issue that has transcended its actual particulars to become a touchstone of conservative identity , potentially furthering the rift that has grown between both fiscal and social religious conservatives and Francis , who they hint has no authority to intervene so prominently in non-doctrinal matters .\nBut the reality of the Vatican ’ s position on Palestine is more complicated . As John Allen notes in Crux , like Francis ’ pronouncements on capitalism and the environment , people assume a break from tradition has occurred only because they weren ’ t paying attention to the papacy before rock star Francis . In reality , it is actually a continuation of long-held papal positions . The Vatican ’ s support for Palestine isn ’ t particularly new .\nWhen Pope Benedict XVI travelled to the Middle East in 2009 , he pledged support for Palestinian statehood . St. John Paul II made similar statements many times , and was sufficiently fond of former PLO leader Yasser Arafat that he had a set of the Stations of the Cross made out of ivory , presented to him by Arafat as a gift , installed in a small chapel off a Vatican chamber .\nIt ’ s more accurate to view this particular step in the Vatican ’ s relationship with Palestine both as a continuation of the Holy See ’ s long-standing support for Palestinian statehood and as an expression of Francis ’ overriding interest in fostering international peace—and his unique ability and willingness to put his finger on the scales to do so .\nWhen Francis toured the Holy Lands last year , he made a highly symbolic stop at the wall dividing Bethlehem from Israel and later invited Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli President Shimon Peres to a prayer summit at the Vatican , where he talked about the “ courage to take concrete steps to achieve peace . ”\nAnd it ’ s likely no coincidence that the new treaty with the Palestinian state was announced just days before Francis is set to canonize two Palestinian nuns , Marie Alphonsine Ghattas of Jerusalem and Mariam Bawardy of Galilee , who will become the first Palestinian Arab saints in a Vatican ceremony attended by Abbas . The canonizations , like the Vatican ’ s relationship with Palestine , have been underway long before Francis . But he will use it highlight both the importance of Christians living in Palestine and the need for fairness for the Palestinian people in a way that only a rock star can . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "199": "Unfair policing of African Americans a 'widespread phenomenon , ' Attorney General Barr says The nation 's top law enforcement officer sat down for an ABC News exclusive .\nAmid nationwide unrest and frustration with law enforcement , Attorney General William Barr on Wednesday acknowledged that communities of color are often policed differently from white ones , calling the unfairness a “ widespread phenomenon . ”\n“ I do think it is a widespread phenomenon that African American males , in particular , are treated with extra suspicion and maybe not given the benefit of the doubt , ” Barr told ABC News Chief Justice Correspondent Pierre Thomas in an exclusive interview .\n“ I think it is wrong if people are not respected appropriately and given their due , ” he explained , “ and I think it ’ s something we have to address . ”\nBacklash and protests in the wake of multiple high-profile killings of unarmed African Americans – including of George Floyd in Minneapolis – has evolved into a national reckoning and calls for an overhaul of law enforcement .\nBarr said he hopes Floyd ’ s death “ is a catalyst for the kinds of changes that are needed . ”\n“ Before the George Floyd incident I thought we were in a good place , ” he continued . “ I think that this episode in Minneapolis showed that we still have some work to do in addressing the distrust that exists in the African American community toward law enforcement . ”\nABC 's Pierre Thomas interviews Attorney General William Barr , July 8 , 2020 . Luke Barr/ABC News\nIn Congress , efforts to enact legislative change in law enforcement have thus far failed . A police reform bill penned in June by Sen. Tim Scott , R-S.C. , died in the Senate , where Democrats voted almost unanimously against moving forward with the proposal .\nScott , who joined Barr during his visit to South Carolina on Wednesday to meet with law enforcement , insisted “ the bill wasn ’ t a failure , ” and told ABC News that he remains hopeful that legislators can come together on crafting a bipartisan effort .\nAs protests continue , Barr pushed back on calls to “ defund the police , ” a phrase that has emerged as a rallying cry for demonstrators . Asked whether there is “ value in defunding the police , ” Barr was unequivocal : “ No , because I don ’ t think the money should come out of the police . ”\n“ We have to think about more investment in the police , ” he added . “ So one of the things we ’ ve been talking about is trying to direct some of the [ Health and Human Services ] money and grant programs and sync it up with law enforcement spending so we can enable the departments to have co-responders . That is , social workers and mental health experts who can go on certain kinds of calls to help . ”\nArtist Dustin Klein projects an image of George Floyd onto the statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee in Richmond , Va. , June 18 , 2020 . Julia Rendleman/Reuters\nIn the department ’ s only civil rights investigation into police use of force , Barr shared the results exclusively with ABC News .\n“ We found , in that case , that there was a drug unit in the Springfield ( Mass . ) police department that was engaged in a pattern and practice of using excessive force , ” Barr said .\nWhen pressed over why previous administrations had mounted approximately 70 `` pattern or practice '' probes in comparison with the single investigation under the Trump administration , Barr said he would not necessarily be opposed to using them as a tool more in the future — but indicated his belief that there are better ways to conduct oversight of police departments .\nABC 's Pierre Thomas interviews Attorney General William Barr , July 8 , 2020 . Luke Barr/ABC News\nBarr also weighed in on the Black Lives Matter movement , which has seen a notable uptick in support in recent weeks despite harsh criticism from President Donald Trump , who has called the movement a `` symbol of hate . '' A recent study from the Pew Research Center found that more than two-thirds of Americans now support it to some extent .\n`` Black Lives Matter -- is a term that 's being used , it 's a group that pushes for civil rights of African Americans . What 's -- what 's your view of Black Lives Matter ? And are you willing to say Black Lives Matter ? '' Thomas asked .\n`` Well , I make a distinction . I 'd make a distinction between the organization , which I do n't agree with . They have a broader agenda , '' Barr responded . `` But in terms of the proposition that black lives matter , obviously black lives matter . I think all lives all human life is is sacred and entitled to respect . And obviously , black lives matter .\n`` But I also think that it 's being used now is sort of distorting the debate to some extent , because it 's used really to refer exclusively to black lives that are lost to police misconduct , which are , you know , have been going down statistically . Five years ago , there were 40 such incidents . This last year it was 10 . So at least it 's a positive trajectory there . But then you compare it to a thousand homicides in the African American community . Those black lives matter , too . And those are lives that are protected by the police , '' he added .\nIn his framing of the Black Lives Matter movement , however , Barr said it remains is too narrow . More focus should be placed on economic advancement as opposed to “ just physical safety. ” On its website , the Black Lives Matter movement describes itself as `` committed to struggling together and to imagining and creating a world free of anti-Blackness , where every Black person has the social , economic , and political power to thrive . ''\n“ It ’ s not just protecting life . It ’ s black lives matter in ensuring that African Americans fully participate in the benefits of this society and their lives flourish , ” Barr continued . “ It goes beyond just physical safety . It goes to getting good education , it goes to having economic opportunities . ”\nIn terms of violence against African Americans , Barr added that he fears protesters are missing a key element of the broader narrative . That is , violence within their own communities .\n“ I also think [ the phrase ] is being used now – it is distorting the debate to some extent , because it is used really to refer almost exclusively to black lives that are lost to police misconduct , ” he said . “ Then you compare it to 8,000 homicides in the African American community , those are black lives that matter , too . And those are lives that are protected by the police . ”\nIn Kansas City , for example , Barr said the Justice Department has been in touch with state authorities in Missouri to provide additional federal agents after what Barr called “ a serious spike in crime . ”\nThe influx of support will be called Operation Legend , named after a 4-year-old boy who was shot and killed while sleeping in his Kansas City home . The boy had just recovered from open-heart surgery .\n“ My daughter had open heart surgery at a comparable age , and I remember how stressful it was for our family , ” Barr said . “ And the idea of your child surviving that , and the joy you would feel to see your kid pull through something like that , it affected me a lot . ”\nThis report was featured in the Thursday , July 9 , 2020 , episode of “ Start Here , ” ABC News ’ daily news podcast .\n`` Start Here '' offers a straightforward look at the day 's top stories in 20 minutes .

    "200": "Those are some of the messages Donald Trump voters had for the president as the 100-day milemarker of his presidency approached , in a politically centrist county where ███ has been tracking Trump support since before the inauguration .\nBacking for the president in Northampton County , Pennsylvania , a former industrial juggernaut which voted for Barack Obama twice before falling for Trump in 2016 , appeared to be healthy , three months in . Both Democrats and Republicans who voted for Trump gave him positive marks – a B-plus or A-minus – although many supporters said the clock is ticking for the president to deliver on tax reform and other promises .\n“ The people who were for Trump and who supported him and voted for him are still 100 % behind him , ” said John Morganelli , the Democratic county district attorney who has been re-elected six times ( and who declined to say whom he voted for last November ) . “ So I think if the election was held again today , in Northampton County there ’ s a good chance that Trump would carry this county again . And it might be slightly closer , but I think that he would probably do well . ”\nNorthampton was not supposed to jump for Trump in 2016 . The Hillary Clinton campaign was so confident of victory here that it moved local operatives out of state , to North Carolina and elsewhere , in the run-up to the election .\nBut Trump ’ s promise to make America great again found unexpected traction in Northampton , among Democratic voters who remembered the heyday of Bethlehem steel , once a local symbol of national strength , or who sensed , they say , that Clinton did not truly care about their lives and challenges .\nTrump won here by four points . To hear many voters in Northampton tell it , he would do the same tomorrow .\n“ It ’ s only 100 days , ” said Christy Facciponti , 54 , a former engineer at Bethlehem Steel , who was flying a Trump flag outside her home in Nazareth , Pennsylvania , last week . “ Please , give him a second . He ’ s already done more than Obama ever did . ”\nThe little fat boy over there , I think he ’ s putting a set of manners on him . Barber Joe D ’ Ambrosio\nJoe D ’ Ambrosio , a barber in Bethlehem who changed his party registration from Democratic in 2016 to vote for Trump in the primary , praised the president ’ s conduct of foreign policy , especially his showdown with the North Korean leader , Kim Jong-un .\n“ Trump tells the strongest guys in town , if you want to mess with him , he ’ ll mess with you , ” D ’ Ambrosio said . “ And the little fat boy over there , I think he ’ s putting a set of manners on him . ”\nBruce Haines , a Republican former steel executive who runs the Historic Hotel Bethlehem , praised Trump ’ s installation of Neil Gorsuch on the supreme court and said support for the president in the business community was robust .\nHealth insurance woes helped elect Trump , but his cure may be more painful Read more\n“ The divisions are as strong as they were on election night , ” Haines said . “ The Trump people are just as supportive of Trump as they were on election night , and the anti-Trump voters are probably stronger against – there isn ’ t anything that guy ’ s going to do to get the Hillary voters . They ’ re just not going to accept anything . ”\nBut even Trump ’ s strongest supporters say the clock is ticking for the president to sign major legislation in multiple areas , no matter how out to lunch Congress may be .\n“ Goodness sakes alive , Republicans have run on tax reform as long as I can remember , and we don ’ t seem to get it , ” said Lee Snover , a Republican activist who is a kind of Patient Zero for Trump support in Northampton . “ I mean I ’ ve got a Republican House , and a Republican Senate and a Republican president , and I still don ’ t have lower taxes ? So I ’ m really having a difficult time internalizing that , coming to grips with that and accepting that . I really am .\nAs the dogwoods and magnolias bloomed and lawnmowers came out across Northampton county , interviews with Trump voters did reveal some pockets of discontent with the president , especially among people who said they had backed him on an impulse , or who had expected him to do more , sooner .\nMarie Claire Placide is a two-time Obama voter whose dress shop in Bangor , in the north of the county , is going out of business . She voted for Trump , she said , “ because I know he ’ s a businessman , and , you know , he used to be a Democrat ” .\n“ So I chose him , ” Placide said . “ I even had some Democrat friends angry – ‘ Why were you voting for Trump ? ’ I said it ’ s a free country . I vote for who I want . ”\n███ asked Placide , who was naturalized as an American citizen in 1990 and who works an evening shift for a nursing agency to put her two children through college , whether she thought Trump had made America great again .\n“ I don ’ t watch the news any more , ” Placide continued . “ I ’ m not interested any more . After the election , I didn ’ t watch the news . ”\nAround the corner from Placide ’ s soon-to-be-shuttered shop sits Miller ’ s Paint and Wallpaper , a local mainstay since 1923 . Duane Miller , the 79-year-old owner and a Democrat , was mayor of Bangor from 1974 to 1990 .\n“ As a very last-minute voter , I voted for Trump , ” Miller said . “ My first reaction was that Hillary would be the president and was unbeatable , you know , and there would be no problem . Having said that , my customers here , I was extremely surprised to find how many voted for Donald Trump . And it was almost as a protest .\n“ It ’ s the disillusionment of the common man with government , because government has done nothing to help the average working man . ”\nMiller said that he had detected a provisional fall-off in enthusiasm for Trump around town , and he said that if the election were held in Bangor tomorrow , there was a chance Trump might lose .\nTrump loyalists stand by their man – but the resistance is taking root Read more\n“ There ’ s been a change , but how much I ’ m not sure , ” Miller said . “ In other words , people are saying , well , ‘ I don ’ t agree with Trump that he did this , or I don ’ t agree with that. ’ But not to a big factor . The factor is , ‘ I voted for Trump , but I ’ m not sure I should have , ’ would be the best way to say it . ”\nMelissa Hough runs the Slate Belt Heritage Center in Bangor , which showcases the region ’ s once-thriving slate quarries and the historic immigration flows that shaped its diverse labor pool .\nAs the 100-day mark approached , Hough said : “ I think the support remains . ”\n“ The economy improved elsewhere , ” she said . “ It didn ’ t improve here , so I think a lot of people blamed the government , because that ’ s what they heard on TV , and they do not blame the factors closest to them – like the companies they worked for , the corporations . ”\nMiller said voters had noticed that Trump has not repealed Obama ’ s healthcare law , has not started construction on a border wall and has not enacted tax reform .\nOn health reform , Miller says , “ he promised a promise he can ’ t keep ” . “ And other things he promised , he can ’ t keep . So how will that come out in the long run ? If it continues that he can ’ t keep these promises , or some of them , then we won ’ t have a Republican president next time .\n“ If he can ’ t produce , then he ’ ll be as bad as Hillary . ”\nBack down south , in Bethlehem , D ’ Ambrosio , the barber , pointed out a bumper sticker someone had left on his car , which already had a Trump sticker . The anonymously gifted sticker read : “ Trump 2016 : Finally someone with balls ! ”\n“ I think my customers , they ’ re all behind him , ” D ’ Ambrosio said .\n“ I knew you were coming , so I did a little survey this week . And I said to everybody , ‘ This guy ’ s gon na come from ███ , and is gon na ask these questions. ’ I said , ‘ What do you want me to tell him ? ’\nD ’ Ambrosio said that some customers faulted Trump for using Twitter too much , but the reception for his cabinet appointments , his leadership style and particularly for his military actions had been “ very positive ” .\n“ He jumped in polls , ” the barber said . “ Why did he jump in polls ? Because he showed strength . And listened to the people he put in charge . ‘ Cause hell , he ’ s no general .\n“ He doesn ’ t have to know everything about everything , because you know , he doesn ’ t walk on water . But as long as he ’ s a good administrator , and he picks good people , and he works with them , that ’ s what we want . ”\nSnover , the Republican activist , said people took confidence from what they perceived as Trump ’ s projection of power .\n“ I think the people have a lot more confidence in America , ” Snover said . “ They ’ re losing fear and they ’ re gaining courage , especially from the military positions he ’ s taken . His overall theme , that we ’ re powerful , has made Americans feel encouraged – they feel confident . I think he ’ s brought on that feeling . ”\nHaines , the hotel owner , said he gave Trump an A-minus on the strength of the Gorsuch appointment to the supreme court , but added that the president needed to reach across the aisle to close deals on healthcare reform and tax cuts .\n“ I don ’ t really have a strike against him , ” Haines said . “ I would encourage him to try and find some moderate Democrats that he can schmooze . ”\nSnover said that , for now , Congress was catching the blame for whatever was not getting done .\n“ A lot of people , people in the party , are not blaming Trump for anything that ’ s not been accomplished , ” she said . “ They ’ re blaming Congress , including the Republicans , because they ’ ve been there longer and they ’ ve always been the problem . ”\nFacciponti , the Nazareth resident flying a Trump flag , sat down for a chat on her porch swing .\n“ We put it back up for the inauguration and kept it up , ” she said of the flag . If the election were held again today , she said , “ I think he ’ d win by more . ”\nA conversation about possible areas where Trump had fallen short quickly turned to what Facciponti said were the media ’ s efforts to tear down the president .\n“ The media just hates him , ” she said . “ It ’ s really sad . If the mainstream media would give him one-tenth of the chance they gave Obama , he would be so loved . It ’ s just sad that people – the Never Trumpers – that people are that stubborn . ”\nLarry Hallett , the owner of a restaurant and paving company outside Bangor , also thought that Trump ’ s good intentions and efforts to compromise had been undercut by antagonists in the media and the Washington establishment .\n“ I think he ’ s trying actually , I think he ’ s sincerely trying to get everybody together and try to use them all , but they ’ re making it very difficult for him . I really do , ” said Hallett .\n“ I think if the Democrats came up with something that was a very good decision , I think he would try everything , no matter how much it takes . The man I seem to know there would cherish all of them . ”\nMorganelli , the district attorney , said “ a lot of people ” agreed with that assessment .\n“ Everywhere I go , restaurants , I bump into folks , sometimes just in casual conversation , ” he said . “ It ’ s anecdotal evidence , but , ‘ What do you think of Trump ? ’\n“ And over and over again , the people who voted for him say ‘ Hey , I voted for him , I ’ m still thinking what he ’ s doing is right . ’\n“ There are a lot of people who agree that the media overall has been tough on him , maybe perhaps tougher than they have on other presidents . ”\nD ’ Ambrosio saw Trump ’ s clashes with the media as a sign of his tactical canniness .\n“ I think his big thing is unpredictability , and that ’ s the best thing that you could do .

He faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison if convicted , though he may yet face additional charges .\nUS prosecutors allege Assange helped Manning crack an encrypted password to gain access to the computer network under a username that did not belong to her , making it more difficult for authorities to trace the source of leaked documents .\nPlay Video 0:55 Julian Assange removed from Ecuadorian embassy in London - video\n“ Assange , who did not possess a security clearance or need to know , was not authorised to receive classified information of the United States , ” they said .\nManning had by then given WikiLeaks hundreds of thousands of secret government records , including logs from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq . She went on to give them a huge cache of secret diplomatic cables . Some of the files were published by WikiLeaks in partnership with news organisations including ███ .\nThe indictment cited online discussions between the two in which Assange was seen “ actively encouraging Manning to provide more information ” , the justice department said .\n“ After this upload , that ’ s all I really have got left , ” Manning was said to have told Assange in one message . Assange allegedly replied : “ Curious eyes never run dry in my experience . ”\nAssange was secretly indicted in March last year by a grand jury in Alexandria , Virginia , according to the documents released on Thursday . The charge remained a secret until it was partly revealed by the justice department in a mistaken court filing last November .\nBy charging Assange with hacking rather than for publishing classified information , US prosecutors avoided having to directly challenge the press freedoms guaranteed under the first amendment of the US constitution .\nThe charge accuses Assange of conspiring to “ knowingly access a computer without authorisation ” in order to obtain secret information whose release “ could be used to the injury of the United States and the advantage of any foreign nation ” .\nBut allies of Assange said the US was prosecuting a publisher by the back door .\nBarry Pollack , an attorney for the WikiLeaks founder , condemned what he called “ an unprecedented effort ” to “ extradite a foreign journalist to face criminal charges for publishing truthful information ” .

But Eric Holder , Obama ’ s first attorney general , reportedly decided against bringing charges out of concerns that a precedent could be set for prosecuting publishers .\nThe grand jury in Virginia has continued investigating Assange in recent months , indicating the possibility of future charges . WikiLeaks has come under scrutiny for publishing leaked spying tools taken from the CIA , and for releasing emails hacked from the accounts of senior Democrats during the 2016 election campaign .\nSenator Mark Warner of Virginia , the senior Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee , said in response to the charges that Assange had become “ a direct participant in Russian efforts to undermine the west ” and should be punished .\nThe US confirmed it would seek the extradition of Assange from the UK . He was arrested on Thursday morning at the embassy of Ecuador , where he had been staying since 2012 after being granted asylum . He was then under investigation by authorities in Sweden for allegations of sexual assault , which he denied .\nAttorneys for Assange said they would fight the extradition process , which could result in a lengthy legal dispute in the British courts system .\nManning was convicted in 2013 under the Espionage Act for stealing classified government records . In May 2017 she was released from a military prison in Kansas after serving seven years of a 35-year sentence .

Neither will the women who stood up to the president yesterday , and neither will the millions of women who have been marching since the women ’ s march [ in January ] to stand up against policies they do not agree with . ”\nTrump singled out Gillibrand while ignoring the male senators who have also called on him to step down : the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders , the New Jersey senator Cory Booker and the Oregon senator Jeff Merkley .\nThe White House press secretary , Sarah Sanders , denied there were any sexual implications behind Trump ’ s tweet , telling reporters : “ Only if your mind is in the gutter would you have read it that way .\n“ This is the same sentiment the president has expressed many times before when he has exposed corruption of the entire political system , ” Sanders said . “ This isn ’ t a new sentiment .

    "203": "Storrs , Connecticut ( CNN ) – Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton lamented the state of journalism on Wednesday , telling an audience at the University of Connecticut that journalism is now driven more by entertainment than fact based reporting .\nClinton , who has been the focus of national media attention since the early 1990s , told the 2,300-person audience that `` journalism has changed quite a bit in a way that is not good for the country and not good for journalism . ''\n`` A lot of serious news reporting has become more entertainment driven and more opinion-driven as opposed to factual , '' she said . `` People book onto the shows , political figures , commentators who will be controversial who will be provocative because it ’ s a good show . You might not learn anything but you might be entertained and I think that ’ s just become an unfortunate pattern that I wish could be broken . ''\nClinton 's comments came as part of the question and answer portion to Wednesday ’ s event . University of Connecticut President Susan Herbst asked Clinton about how journalism has changed and whether journalists could help break gridlock that has halted work in Washington .\nThe former secretary of state went on to say that she feels there is a space for `` explanatory journalism because there ’ s a lot going on in the world that needs explanation . ''\nThe former first lady also had a tip for journalists : Do your homework .\n`` It ’ s important for journalists to realize that they have to do their homework too and they really should be well-prepared when they interview people , when they talk about issues , '' she said . `` I think that it ’ s with professional tweaking and creativity we could address some of the issues we know are plaguing journalism today​ . ''\nClinton has long been the focus of journalists ' attention , which at times has caused an acrimonious view of media .\nAccording to the diary of Diane Blair , a longtime Clinton confidant whose personal documents gained media attention earlier this year , Clinton regularly expressed frustration and a deep distrust of the media .\nIn January 1995 , Blair wrote that Clinton expressed “ her total exasperation with all this obsession and attention , and how hard she ’ s finding to conceal her contempt for it all. ” On Thanksgiving Day 1996 , Blair wrote that Clinton thought the press was “ complete hypocrites . ”\n“ Say they want the truth , want power to be transparent , but in fact they prefer the backstage manipulation of B. Bush , N. Reagan , B. Truman , R. Carter , ” Blair wrote , listing several former first ladies . “ On her death bed , wants to be able to say she was true to herself and is not going to do phoney makeovers to please others . ”\nWhen her husband , Bill Clinton , was president , many in the White House worried of a `` vast right-wing conspiracy '' that aimed to take down the Clinton White House . Some of that concern stemmed from the rise of right wing media and blogs .\nClinton 's 2008 campaign also suffered from a sometimes tense relationship with the media . In 2008 , former President Clinton railed against what he called `` the most biased coverage in history , '' and both Clintons complained of what they believed to be pervasive sexism dominating the campaign narrative .\nIn response to her remarks , Tim Miller , executive director of American Rising PAC , a conservative research and media super PAC , said Clinton 's problem with the media stemmed from `` a lack of interest in transparency , not the media . She 's never going to like anyone that tries to hold her accountable . ''\nWhile in Storrs , Clinton also talked about National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden , the future of the Ukraine-Russia relationship and the importance of youth participation .\nBecause the remarks came at University of Connecticut , a school whose basketball program won both Division I national championship in 2014 , the former secretary of state also brandished some of her basketball bona fides , telling the audience that she was `` a big fan '' of Shabazz Napier , the men 's senior guard .\nClinton , who has used the last few months to travel the country and deliver paid speeches , has acknowledged that she is thinking about a presidential run in 2016 . All polls have her as the Democratic frontrunner and it is likely that she would win the nomination if she won .\nFormer Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut , who attended Wednesday 's event , said the former first lady should think about running , while Connecticut 's Sen. Richard Blumenthal said he would support Clinton `` when and if she does .

    "204": "Shall we cast our minds back to the more innocent era of 1992 , when the presidential campaign of a young southern governor by the name of Bill Clinton was nearly derailed by claims that he ’ d had an extramarital affair with a former lounge singer by the name of Gennifer Flowers ?\nAs it happens , Clinton survived that episode – he and Hillary appeared jointly on 60 Minutes , as Hillary famously explained : “ You know , I ’ m not sitting here , some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette ” , but it was a close-run thing .\nNow imagine that a tape emerged in which Clinton and his personal lawyer were heard discussing how best to pay the hush money that would keep Flowers silent , an undeclared payment that would be in violation of campaign finance laws . There can be no doubt : it would have destroyed Clinton as a candidate , and it would have been seized on as ( further ) grounds for his impeachment as president .\nSign up to receive the latest US opinion pieces every weekday\nYet late on Tuesday , the lawyer for Michael Cohen – Donald Trump ’ s personal attorney , fixer and keeper of his secrets – released a tape in which he and Trump are heard discussing how exactly to fund the silencing of a former Playboy model , Karen McDougal . Cohen apparently wanted it be handled legally , while Trump seemingly had other ideas .\n“ We ’ ll have to pay , ” Cohen says . Trump ’ s reply : “ Pay with cash . ”\nPut aside the impact an equivalent revelation about Clinton would have made in 1992 . Just imagine the storm this would have caused if it had come out at the time Cohen and Trump had that conversation , just two months before the 2016 election . The entire political class would have assumed it would be devastating .\nAnd yet few would now bet on the Cohen tape story destroying Trump . Instead , they ’ ll guess it will dominate the news cycle for a few hours , and be ignored by Fox News before being replaced by something else . For this has become the established pattern .\nNote this month ’ s revelations by BBC ’ s Panorama programme that Trump behaved like a “ predator ” at parties packed with teenage girls in the 1980s and 1990s . It included the testimony of Barbara Pilling , then a young model , who recalled Trump asking her age . On hearing that she was 17 , Trump said : “ Oh , great . So you ’ re not too old and not too young . That ’ s just great. ” Pilling added that she “ felt I was in the presence of a shark ” . Again , imagine what similar revelations would have done to the standing of Clinton or any previous president . Yet for Trump , they made barely a dent .\nThe simple , stubborn fact is that nothing seems to move Trump ’ s core supporters away from him . His approval rating among Republicans remains sky high ( though there are signs that the pool of Americans who identify as Republicans is shrinking , perhaps suggesting that it ’ s increasingly only Trump true believers who are proud to wear that party label ) . Trump ’ s 2016 observation that he could shoot people on Fifth Avenue and still not lose votes remains as valid as ever .\nIt ’ s one reason why Trump ’ s opponents ought not to invest too much hope in the special counsel Robert Mueller ’ s investigation into alleged collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign . Even if Mueller produces jaw-dropping evidence against Trump , the president ’ s base is unlikely to be impressed . For a flavour of the likely response , note Alex Jones ’ s latest Infowars broadcast , making the wild , evidence-free allegation that Mueller was involved in a child sex ring and fantasising about shooting Mueller . ( Predictably , Facebook , which carries Infowars , said the broadcast did not breach its rules . )\nWe have to face the grim reality that in our post-2016 world few of the previous norms and standards apply . In Britain , too , we can see how things have changed . There was a time when a government admission that it was having to plan for the possibility that food and medicine would run out – not through natural disaster , but because of a policy it was pursuing – would have been terminal . Now it ’ s just another day in Brexit .\nThe problem seems to be that a chunk of the electorate – whether diehard Trump supporters or hardcore Brexiters – is impervious to any countervailing evidence . By that same logic , hope surely must rest with those voters who are in the great middle : quieter than the rest , perhaps , but open to persuasion and willing to be moved by demonstrable facts . Those people surely still exist .\nIf there were to be a second referendum on Brexit , their votes would be crucial . In the US , they will have a decisive opportunity to make their voice heard in November ’ s midterm elections . At that moment , they will have much more than a chance to punish Trump . They will also have it in their hands to restore a set of norms that currently lies battered and bleeding . It ’ s no exaggeration to say that the world is depending on them . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "205": "On a level of basic human sympathy , it 's painful to see anyone , including former Virginia Gov . Bob McDonnell and first lady Maureen McDonnell , sob through the jury 's reading of 11 and nine guilty counts , respectively . They have children and grandchildren and , barring an appeal , are likely headed to jail for a significant chunk of time . And that 's after , in a desperate , quirky and ultimately unsuccessful defense , they laid bare the daily troubles with their marriage for the world to absorb . It felt dirty to watch the trial , and I , at least , did n't feel it was necessary to write daily updates about the tabloid trash revealed in court on any particular day .\nBut what must be most painful for the McDonnells right now is the knowledge of how completely avoidable this was . There 's nothing even approaching honor or pride in these transgressions . There 's no crime here that you can convince yourself was the right call as a statesman ; you ca n't even say , in some sort of Nixonian way , all I had in mind , the whole time , was the good of the people of Virginia . There 's nothing like that here , unless you think that Virginians really needed the dietary supplement Anatabloc in order to live long and prosper . Bob and Maureen McDonnell will go down as the first Virginia first couple to go down on criminal charges ... because they took a bunch of cash and golf trips and Rolexes .\nCash , golf trips , Rolexes , vacations , checks , vacations , Ferrari rides : The components of the $ 100,000+ in gifts and loans that they received from Star Scientific CEO Jonnie Williams Sr. , in exchange for using the powers of the governorship to promote his dumb diet pill thing , could n't have been a shinier bundle of objects for the prosecution to present to the jury . In modern politics , corruption charges are usually more tediously complex : Money was wired here and then laundered via a pass-through , which made its way through another pass-through and was distributed through a foundation before ending up at a nonprofit designed to help such and such 's interests with a client trying to change regulations in foreign markets , or whatever . Not in this case . The prosecution just had to show the jury images of the idiot governor showing off his flashy watch that was given to him by the rich businessman for whom he did favors in return . How much simpler could this get ? It 's only a degree of reality or two away from an old-timey political cartoon of a tuxedoed plutocrat , smoking a cigar , handing over a big bag marked `` $ $ $ , '' to a crooked politician slapping his back and cackling .\nEven when the McDonnells realized they 'd been caught , and indicted , for cartoonish quid pro quo corruption , they inexplicably continued to roll the dice . You 'd think they 'd realize , Oh god , they caught us taking lots of money from this guy , better strike a deal ! And yet they did n't . Bob McDonnell rejected a plea deal that would have charged him with one felony and let Maureen McDonnell off free . Whoops !\nThe McDonnells -- or each McDonnell , given the state of their marriage -- must have decided that they had a fantastic chance of defeating this in court . Umm . Did they talk to their lawyers before rejecting that deal ? Because the defense -- the now infamous defense -- that they took in court reeked of desperation all the way through . If you 're willing to testify for days about the stunning levels of dysfunction in your marriage , as the best hope for your exoneration , does n't that suggest that you may not have the strongest case ? Does n't that suggest that perhaps you would 've been better taking a plea deal ? It did n't even cohere . The idea that Bob and Maureen McDonnell were on such bad terms that there was no way they could have had a discussion or two about taking this guy 's money just does n't make sense .\nThe obvious explanation for Bob McDonnell 's tears is that he 's going to jail for a while . It would make me cry , too ! But you also get the feeling that Bob McDonnell had n't come to terms with the hubris , and all of the missteps along the way , until this was read . These were crimes of such classic simplicity that a defendant could , at least for a while , convince himself of the unreality of it all . That there 's no way he could have gotten caught up in such a self-parody of a scheme , or that a jury would actually send him to jail over these things . Did this really happen ?\nYeah , it really did .

    "206": "If the Republican Party is at a crossroads , two distinct paths are being blazed by two very different candidates on Election Day 2013 .\nIn New Jersey , a pragmatic and often aggressive incumbent is poised to run up the score on the Democratic challenger -- despite the state 's deep shade of blue .\nIn Virginia , a strong social conservative with tea party support is in real danger of losing to a flawed Democrat -- despite the state 's history of electing governors from the party that 's shut out of the White House .\nThe result is that the two `` off-year '' races that have long been viewed as national harbingers are instead offering lessons primarily to a Republican Party that 's still engaged in a spirited fight for its own identity .\nThe split decision that 's likely to emerge today seems certain to exacerbate tensions over which way Republicans should be headed , a year after an election debacle for the GOP , and a year before the midterm elections .\n`` If the polls hold true and [ Ken ] Cuccinelli loses , it shows that successful Republicans drive down the middle of the right-hand side of the road -- they do n't drive off into the ditch on the right , '' said Whit Ayres , a veteran Virginia-based Republican pollster .\n`` It 's hard to say that the Republican Party is in a stronger position today than a year ago , '' Ayres added . `` But I 'm hopeful that more and more Republicans are willing to see the light at the end of the long , dark tunnel . ''\nThat light will be shining on Gov . Chris Christie , R-N.J. , whose 30-point-plus lead in pre-election polls leave him poised to become perhaps the biggest GOP winner in a trying year .\nChristie 's team is hoping for a win that will hold conservative voters and make deep inroads among Latinos , Democrats and independents -- proving that a certain style of leadership can overcome partisan leanings .\n`` His apparent success proves that people will reward decisive action and truth-telling , and that people are prepared to look beyond maybe their own party affiliations or even ideological predispositions where they see an instance of effective action in the public interest , '' said former Gov . Mitch Daniels , R-Ind. , who is now president of Purdue University . `` Plainly , that 's what 's going on when a guy like Gov . Christie is that successful in a state like the one he lives in . ''\nThough Republican leaders rarely say so directly , the flip side of that success is evident in Virginia . The GOP candidate for governor , Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli , has trailed consistently in polls against Democrat Terry McAuliffe , swamped by independents and female voters in particular .\nVirginia has been trending Democratic in recent years , but Cuccinelli barely sought out the center . His campaign has been defined by his tea party ties and strong social conservative views , with late efforts aimed primarily at turning out the Republican base .\nMcAuliffe , a former Democratic National Committee chairman and longtime friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton , was thought by many Democrats to be deeply flawed as a candidate , owing to a colorful business past and ties to the unsavory money side of politics . He did n't even make it through the Democratic primary when he ran for governor 2009 .\nOn the eve of the election , though , McAuliffe aides see national implications in the fact that he 's been able to reach moderate voters with a pro-jobs message , without sacrificing support inside the Democratic base .\n`` We have no real conflict in appealing to the base of our party and the center of the electorate , '' said Geoff Garin , McAuliffe 's pollster . `` Cuccinelli is emblematic of the Republican dilemma . It is impossible to do both of those things at the same time . ''\nThough Republicans remain optimistic publicly about Cuccinelli 's prospects , the second-guessing has already begun . Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , now a Virginia resident , said Cuccinelli appears to have been too badly outspent by a finely tuned Clinton-backed machine to overcome his own flaws as a candidate .\n`` If he does lose , it may say more about the candidate than the movement , '' Gingrich said Monday in an interview for the ███/Yahoo ! News `` Power Players '' series . `` No one survives a 25-to-1 disadvantage in funding [ down the stretch ] . And this is the first great victory of the Clinton march back to the presidency . ''\n`` If McAuliffe wins the governorship , he is a Hillary Clinton total devotee , '' Gingrich continued . `` He will spend half of his time as governor trying to help her to win the presidency . And I think it is a sign of the power of the Clinton machine . ''\nIn New Jersey , meanwhile , Christie is building a machine of his own . A party that 's seen its identity defined by tea party firebrands Sen. Ted Cruz and Sen. Rand Paul counts among its stars a tough-talking Northeasterner who 's proving he can win broadly in a blue state , said Julian Zelizer , a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University .\n`` Chris Christie has defined himself around this theme -- that he 's the person that 's different from the national party , the person who 's distancing himself from extreme views , '' Zelizer said . `` The message he wants is that his brand of Republican politics is nationally potent . ''\nThat wo n't necessarily convince a conservative base that sees Christie as a social moderate who criticized tea party leaders over the government shutdown -- and that remembers Christie 's embrace of President Obama 's leadership after Hurricane Sandy , Zelizer said .\n`` A lot of conservative Republicans will say , 'We wo n't care . Ted Cruz is our guy , ' '' he said .\nIn a sense , the election in Virginia is demonstrating one of Christie 's biggest obstacles moving forward . Cuccinelli captured the Republican nomination at a party convention dominated by conservative activists , as opposed to through a traditional primary that would draw a broader swath of voters .\n`` Virginia Republicans made this far harder than this needed to be , '' said Ayres , the Republican pollster .\nAfter John McCain fell short of the presidency in 2008 and Mitt Romney followed with a loss in 2012 , the appetite for moderates is limited among Republican primary voters and caucus-goers .\nThe path for Christie , should he choose to pursue it , only gets tougher from here . Should he run for president , he will need to at least neutralize a tea party movement that 's grown more restive during the second Obama term .\n`` He has a powerful platform from which to preach , '' Ayres said . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "207": "The Justice Department has charged former House Speaker Dennis Hastert with lying to FBI agents and trying to hide financial transactions intended to keep prior misconduct secret , prosecutors alleged .\nThe 73-year-old Hastert , a top Republican on Capitol Hill before he left Congress in 2007 , agreed five years ago to pay an unidentified person $ 3.5 million “ to compensate for and conceal ” prior “ misconduct against ” that person , according to prosecutors .\nOver the next four years , Hastert withdrew about $ 1.7 million in cash from various bank accounts and provided that money to the unidentified person , according to the Justice Department .\nStarting in July 2012 , Hastert allegedly structured those cash withdrawals in such a way that it would prevent banks from having to report the transactions . Under federal law , banks are required to report cash transactions over $ 10,000 . Under those structures , Hastert allegedly withdrew $ 952,000 .\nWhen the FBI questioned Hastert in December 2014 about the transactions , he allegedly told the FBI that he was keeping the cash for himself , prosecutors said .\nSpecifically , a grand jury indicted Hastert with one count of structuring currency transactions to evade currency transaction reports and one count of making a false statement to the FBI .\nHastert , of Plano , Illinois , will be arraigned in the coming days .\nThe indictment describes the person who allegedly received the payments only as a resident of Yorkville , Illinois , who has known Hastert most of the person ’ s life .

    "208": "The Cliven Bundy standoff , involving an angry rancher who refuses to pay federal grazing fees , took a new , ugly turn Wednesday night when the New York Times reported horrifying comments he made about `` the Negro '' and slavery . Meanwhile , Bundy 's quest continues to grip Fox News audiences . This is largely because his story is more reasonable if you watch Fox 's creative , often fictionalized version of it .\nHere , then , are nearly two dozen claims that have been uttered in defense of Bundy by Fox personalities , other right-wing pundits and Bundy himself . ( A good deal of them , alas , come from Sean Hannity . )\nFor each claim , we ’ ve offered a bit of a fact-check or truthful context afterward .\n1 . “ The BLM ’ s actions lacked proportionality. ” ( Sean Hannity ) The Bureau of Land Management simply arrived to take cattle , per a court order . They didn ’ t show up with guns drawn and they never even entered Bundy ’ s property . They did , however , carry arms for a good reason : They had received intelligence that Bundy and his crew might cause trouble . There is nothing “ disproportionate ” about being prepared .\n2 . “ The BLM pointed guns at children. ” The Republican Nevada Assemblywoman Michelle Fiore has been saying this during her 15 minutes of fame , including on “ All In With Chris Hayes ” on MSNBC last week . There has been no evidence offered that the BLM “ pointed guns at children. ” Bundy ’ s teenage son attempted to assault officers and kicked a police dog and resisted arrest , and so they used a taser on him , as well they should have .\n3 . “ The Feds are going to ‘ cause another Waco ’ . ” ( Cliven Bundy , et al . ) The feds are trying to avoid another Waco . The U.S. government did not “ cause Waco ” but rather botched the response ; they could have waited it out more patiently to avoid the loss of life of innocent children . And this is exactly why the feds have not pressed the issue ( yet ) with Bundy , and why the BLM stood down .\n4 . “ Since when does the government send armed officers to collect a debt ? ” ( Hannity ) Many repossession and foreclosure actions often involve a sheriff or other armed officials , and confiscation of property is an ordinary means by which a government resolves a debt . For example , if you accumulate 20 years of unpaid parking tickets , a court will order that your car be booted and towed until you pay . And if you point a rifle at the cop or otherwise assault him , you might get shot ( or tased ) .\n5 . “ Nobody has seen any bill for $ 1.1 million . It doesn ’ t exist. ” ( Michelle Fiore , R-Nevada Assembly , on MSNBC ) Bundy says he has “ never been sent a bill ” but also says he never opens mail from the U.S. government because he does not recognize the U.S. government ’ s existence . A court has ordered him to pay a debt of $ 1.1 million in accumulated fines and fees for having put greater than his allowed quota of cattle on federally protected tortoise habitat .\n6 . “ The BLM provoked , escalated this controversy. ” Rep. Steve Stockman , R-Texas , made this accusation , as have numerous others . If an armed resistance is put up against an asset seizure by law enforcement officials who are acting under a court order , the provocation is exclusively the work of those who have chosen to threaten the lawmen with violence .\n7 . “ The land is not being used -- it ’ s not like they want to build a school , road or hospital on it. ” ( Hannity ) How federal land is used is determined by federal law . A citizen does not get to decide for himself whether the land should remain vacant or grazed , or whether something should be built on it .\n8 . “ Harry Reid and his son have a financial motive to remove Bundy ’ s cows. ” ( Bob Massi , Fox News legal correspondent ) There is no evidence at all that Harry Reid or his son have any financial or political interest in what is going on . Don ’ t believe everything you hear on Fox News , especially when the reporter qualifies it , as Massi did here , by saying , “ We don ’ t really know if it ’ s true . ”\n9 . “ The BLM killed cattle and put the corpses in a mass grave. ” There is no evidence that the BLM euthanized Bundy ’ s cattle except some photos and footage of dubious pedigree being aired nightly on Fox News . That said , it is possible that a cow or two could have died during the roundup . Cattle are occasionally killed in large roundups . Now , if there was a mass euthanizing of cattle , the BLM should be forced to explain that .\n10 . “ The sheriff is the only man with arresting power in Clark county. ” Bundy has made this claim in his nightly appearance on the Sean Hannity show , and it has long been a favorite talking point of Tea Partyers , especially in the West . But it is false . Federal officers have arresting power where federal land is trespassed or where federal law has otherwise been broken . The BLM does have an obligation under federal regulations to seek the cooperation of local law enforcement to resolve certain disputes . But in this case , the sheriff refused to help out .\n11 . “ People should not die over a few cows eating free government grass. ” ( Hannity ) That ’ s true , which is why Bundy and his militia members should not have chosen to point guns at federal officials and escalate the situation . Now , those militia members could find themselves getting shot or even killed . Such is the consequence of pointing rifles at lawmen trying to do their job .\n12 . “ How could a cow possibly eat $ 1.1 million of grass ? ” ( Bundy ’ s daughter , Stetsy Bundy ) Cows can easily eat a million bucks worth of grass but that ’ s neither here nor there . Grazing fees are not assessed by weighing the amount of tonnage that a cow eats . It is a per-animal-unit , per-month fee , and it adds up over 20 years . Furthermore , Bundy ’ s liability is as much for fines for illegal trespass as it is for fees .\n13 . “ What ’ s wrong with Bundy ’ s cows simply cutting the grass for free ? ” ( Hannity ) A trespass is not forgiven simply because the trespasser believes he is performing a service for the owner . Furthermore , “ cutting grass ” is not depriving the owner of a nuisance but rather taking a valuable resource ( edible grass ) from the owner .\n14 . “ Bundy has rights to the land because his ancestors worked the land prior to formation of BLM. ” Bundy has made this argument himself and others have echoed it , but even if Bundy ’ s ancestors did work the land ( and we only have his word that they did , and he is notoriously dishonest ) , as of the passage of the Taylor Act in 1934 they would have had to pay grazing fees . And it was never private land . The parcel that Bundy is trespassing has been owned by the U.S. government ever since it was purchased and/or won from Mexico or Spain .\n15 . “ This is all predicated on a tortoise that is not even endangered. ” ( Hannity ) The decision as to whether the tortoise is endangered and whether it can withstand grazing , and how much , is one for biologists to make and can be challenged in court by anyone that disagrees with it , in which case the government must show that it is using valid science .\n16 . “ Grazing more cattle on federal land will keep beef prices down. ” Sean Hannity made this idiotic remark two nights ago . If the government wants to centrally control the market for beef ( as it sometimes does with other commodities ) it is a policy decision to be made by Congress and the Department of Agriculture , not Mr. Bundy or Sean Hannity .\n17 . “ We have rapists , pedophiles and murderers . Why is government focusing on this piece of land ? ” ( Hannity ) The government ’ s decision to seize the assets of a scofflaw will not cause rapes , murders or acts of pedophilia to be neglected . Law enforcement is capable of multitasking .\n18 . “ The feds should simply put a lien on Bundy ’ s property. ” ( Fiore , Hannity et al ) Yes , they can and they should ( and likely have already , since it ’ s been going on 20 years ) , and this would mean that when his cows arrive at market , the proceeds would go directly to the government . But realized that the collection of the past due amount is only one issue -- the other is that Bundy continues to run his cows on land that is closed to grazing , and a lien won ’ t accomplish that .\n19 . “ If you owed money , would you like it if the government came to your house and pointed guns at you and your wife and family ? ” ( Fiore ) The BLM did not “ point guns ” at the Bundys until the Bundys assaulted them . The BLM was doing its job , and Bundy ’ s armed supporters threatened them with force and the son assaulted one of the officers and his dog .\n20 . “ Peaceful protesters were relocated miles away from entrance to the Bundy ranch , and denied their First Amendment Rights. ” ( Brian Sandoval , GOP governor of Nevada ) When law enforcement needs to operate in a tense situation , they are within their rights to move protesters to an area safely away from the action . This is for their own protection , and it is especially appropriate where some of the protesters bring weapons .\n21 . “ Bundy has already paid fees to Nevada County. ” Dana Loesch , a frequent guest on Fox , has repeatedly made this peculiar argument . Whatever Bundy might have paid to Nevada County is of no consequence to his federal tax bill . You can not avoid a federal tax bill by paying fees and taxes to the county .\n22 . “ If the cattle were illegal immigrants , the Justice Department would be running guns to them and Homeland Security would be giving them free phones. ” ( Dana Loesch ) Even if this were true ( and it isn ’ t ) , cattle are not illegal immigrants . Nor does this silly hypothetical scenario bear in any way on the fact that Bundy and his thugs have broken the law by ignoring several court orders , and interfering with law enforcement in many ways . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "209": "Trump will tout economic strength and border security as he faces an audience with an unprecedented number of women\nDonald Trump will attempt to reboot his presidency on Tuesday with a State of the Union address that will tout economic strength and border security – but he faces an audience with an unprecedented number of women and a high degree of scepticism .\nHalfway into his term , having just endured a drubbing in November ’ s congressional elections and after prompting the longest government shutdown in US history , Trump will seek to regain momentum by calling on Congress to come together on infrastructure projects and his trade deal with Canada and Mexico .\nHe will promise that “ we can bridge old divisions , heal old wounds , build new coalitions , forge new solutions , ” the White House previewed .\nThe president will command one of the biggest stages in American politics but , unlike last year ’ s address , Capitol Hill will be something of a hostile environment . Along with Vice-President Mike Pence , the Democratic speaker , Nancy Pelosi – a formidable adversary who has thwarted his border wall at every turn – will sit just over his shoulder on the dais , her facial expressions watched closely by millions of primetime TV viewers .\nSeated in front of Trump will be a record number of female House members , most Democrats and some dressed in white , in homage to the suffragist movement . In the gallery overhead there will be two former employees of Trump ’ s New Jersey golf club , both immigrant women who have gone public about its hiring practices .\nAnd when the speech is over , Stacey Abrams , who ran a close race in the midterms for governor of Georgia , will become the first African American woman to deliver the Democratic rebuttal .\nBenjamin Wittes , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington , said during a recent panel discussion at the thinktank : “ The State of the Union involves ritualised shows of chumminess from the time the president walks in and everybody gives a sort of demonstrative standing ovation , despite what they may be muttering under their breath . [ Pelosi ’ s ] won and he has to walk in there and he has to hug her , give a warm handshake at a minimum …\n“ Everybody will be noticing when she does clap and when she doesn ’ t clap . Everybody will be noticing these little things that she does . ”\nTrump made his debut in the House with an address to a joint session of Congress two years ago . In contrast to his roistering campaign rallies , he struck a sombre tone as he honoured the widow of a dead Navy Seal , prompting the Democratic pundit Van Jones to declare grandiloquently on CNN : “ He became president of the United States in that moment , period . ”\nA year later , Trump gave his first formal State of the Union address , a full hour and 20 minutes that stressed unity and earned rapturous applause from Republicans . But the midterms changed the balance : while the Senate majority Republicans will be out in force , Trump will be reminded that Democrats swept the House , with a record number of women , whose appreciation is likely to be muted .\nCameras are bound to focus on new congresswomen such as Rashida Tlaib of Michigan , who recently promised “ We ’ re gon na impeach the motherfucker ! ” , and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York to see whether they clap any of Trump ’ s lines or attempt some type of protest . The public gallery will also include , at Democrats ’ invitation , federal workers who went without pay for 35 days and are worried about a repeat .\nThe partial government shutdown , triggered by political stalemate over Trump ’ s $ 5.7bn demand for the wall , also led to the postponement of the State of the Union by a week – the first time that had happened since the Challenger space shuttle disaster delayed Ronald Reagan ’ s speech in 1986 . Despite that context , and the looming threat of another shutdown or national emergency if congressional negotiators do not strike a compromise by mid-February , Trump is likely to begin by reeling off accomplishments .\nWittes , who is also editor-in-chief of the Lawfare blog , said : “ The first part is always a victory lap . Even if you ’ re in the trough of a recession , the president says the State of the Union is better than it looks , and then trots out 25 minutes of positive talking points . ”\nHowever , dark claims about MS-13 seem inevitable at some point thanks to one of the speechwriters , immigration hardliner Stephen Miller , in an attempt to throw down the gauntlet to Pelosi . But going in too aggressively carries risks , with young Democrats newly emboldened and even some Republicans becoming restless . Only last week the Senate rebuked him over troop withdrawals from Syria and Afghanistan .\nTrump is expected to declare victory over Isis in Syria , despite US military leaders suspecting the terrorists are just lying low .\nMeanwhile , Bill Whalen , who was chief speechwriter for the former California governor Pete Wilson , said : “ There is uncertainty over interruptions by Democrats . We have plenty of faces of resistance but will we get a voice of resistance through heckling ? The second question is , how unified are the Republicans ? It ’ s a tricky time for him to be in front of them . ”\nWhalen , now a research fellow at the Hoover Institution think tank in Palo Alto , California , added : “ The State of the Union has become a very sad spectacle . We ’ re much more interested in the drama , the theatrics , what people are wearing . It ’ s like an awards show . We don ’ t pay much attention to the substance . ” \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "210": "Comedians and political writers everywhere are on the verge of enjoying a great big simultaneous orgasm . D-Day -- Donald Day -- is upon us and more than any other previous election cycle , it looks like Donald Trump might actually bestow upon us the comedy gift that 'll keep on giving for a way-too-brief six-to-eight months .\nAccording to The Washington Post , Trump is `` likely '' to announce his entry into the campaign for the 2016 Republican Party presidential nomination . One of the Post 's leading indicators is that Trump plans to publish a two-page financial document summarizing his $ 9 billion net worth immediately following his speech at Trump Tower in Manhattan ( here 's to hoping it 's outdoors , on the roof , and really windy ) .\nAll that said , it 's entirely possible this is another Trump bait-and-switch publicity stunt . You might recall how he teased a possible presidential run for the 2012 GOP nomination . At one point , Trump quizzed his contestants on Celebrity Apprentice , asking Meat Loaf if he thought Trump should run , to which Meat Loaf replied with an enthusiastic , `` Absolutely ! '' By the way , that was a feature of the presidential election four years ago -- asking Meat Loaf for political advice -- and it 's actually grown far worse in the last four years . Indeed , today , if Meat Loaf himself decided to run as a Republican , he 'd probably poll better than half the field .\nWith Trump officially joining the race , he vindicates the increasingly obvious analysis that the Republican Party , at the presidential level at least , is little more than a shell corporation for opportunists and careerists who are n't interested in governing or even winning . The addition of Trump is the would-be final brick in the effort to turn the GOP 's nominating process into a dysfunctional and menacingly ugly reality show competition in which the contestants each scramble to be the most flagrant panderer to the Tea Party base and , subsequently , augment their Q-scores within the lucrative conservative entertainment complex . That 's the real prize , and Trump , above all the others , is aiming to scoop up as much of that as he can . He wo n't win the nomination , but that 's not his goal , nor is it the goal of most of the field . The real race is for celebrity heft .\nAccording to RealClearPolitics , Trump is polling somewhere close to the middle of the field at around 3.6 percent . The fact that he 's ahead of Rick Perry , Rick Santorum , Carly Fiorina , Lindsey Graham , Bobby Jindal , and Ohio Gov . John Kasich speaks volumes about where Republican voters are right now . Specifically , they 're not completely ashamed to support a billionaire doofus like Trump . But they should be . ( Perhaps we should ask Meat Loaf if he 's not too ashamed to support Trump . ) It ought to be obvious to anyone paying attention that when Trump says he has a `` secret plan '' to defeat ISIS , but wo n't reveal it until he 's president , there 's clearly no plan and he 's making it up . If he really had a plan , he 'd at least talk about the bullet points to , at the very least , do his part to prevent another beheading . But he 'll just wait until Inauguration Day , 2017 , two years from now to spill the beans about his secret ISIS plan . He 's quite the humanitarian .\nThe fact of the matter is that Trump is a circus sideshow attraction who 's incongruously being regarded as a somewhat serious contender , at least according to the polls . If the first debate were to be held tomorrow , Trump would be one of the top-tier candidates invited to participate . Again , fantastic for those of us who make a living tearing down cartoon characters like Trump , but it 's really bad news for American politics .\nIf the Republican Party truly believes that there 's a serious set of crises facing America , and that they must be resolved or else , the party surely is n't telegraphing to the world that it 's interested in fielding candidates who are commensurate with the seriousness of the nation 's perils . Indeed , it 's exactly the opposite . The more the GOP screeches about how disastrous the Obama presidency has been -- deliberately killing babies , leading from behind , destroying jobs and leading us to the brink of a socialist dystopia ( no matter that none of that is true ) -- then name one serious GOP candidate who can do something to ameliorate all that . It 's definitely not Trump , who 's nothing more than a blowhard reality show hack who lucked and scammed his way into fame and fortune . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "211": "Wayne Bisher , a lifelong Democrat , says he looks forward to voting for a Democrat for president again someday .\nBut when the 68-year-old heard Donald Trump ’ s message on the campaign trail last year , promising to protect American manufacturing and control immigration , there was no doubt whom he would vote for .\nFive months of Trump : Muslims ’ fears were high but neighbors stood by them Read more\nHe took early retirement from his job at a pharmaceuticals plant 14 years ago , when cheap Chinese vitamin C flooded the American market , so Trump ’ s populist “ America First ” message resonated strongly with him .\n“ I voted for Trump because Hillary Clinton was so deceptive , ” Bisher said . “ What I told women : did they really want Hillary Clinton to be the first female president of the United States ? That wasn ’ t a good idea . I would ’ ve voted for other women for president , but not Hillary Clinton . ”\nSix months after Trump ’ s inauguration , with a daily war raging over the president ’ s own alleged deceptions and major campaign promises going unfulfilled , a perceptible shift in mood has set in among Trump voters interviewed for an ongoing Guardian series in Northampton County , Pennsylvania .\nThe thrill of victory , for many Trump backers , has been replaced by something closer to disgust – the kind of disgust that makes people turn off the news .\nThey still back the president . But they express sharp resentment of the president ’ s perceived enemies in the media and official Washington , and describe fatigue from defending a political figure who does not always make it easy . In a striking number of interviews , the conversation eventually turns to the candidate Trump beat eight months ago – Clinton – whose alleged trespasses are brandished to answer questions about Trump ’ s alleged trespasses .\nTo the extent that Trump may be corrupt , his supporters say , Clinton would have been worse – so much worse , to the thinking of some Trump voters , that even if Trump had cheated to win the election , it was worth it .\nFor now , any Trump voters who might be nursing doubts about the president are mostly not advertising that sentiment to the media . “ They don ’ t want to admit that they may be wrong , ” explained Cathy Robinson , 70 .\nRobinson was attending a hot-rod show in East Bangor on Saturday night with her husband , John . While she referred to Trump supporters as “ they ” , Robinson , a registered Democrat , said she had “ not necessarily ” voted for Clinton for president – although she had indeed voted .\n“ That ’ s a hard thing for us as humans to admit that somebody took us over the barrel and we went in there with all the good intentions of changing things , because that ’ s what this person promised he was going to do , ” Robinson said . “ And now we look at it six months later , and we ’ re no better off six months later than we were when Obama was in office .\n“ People do not want to admit that somebody actually fooled them that well . ”\nAlmost every one of the Trump voters approached by ███ said they approved of the president ’ s performance to this point . Allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia , for example , do not concern them much – meaning , among other things , that the nonstop focus on the issue by the media strikes Trump voters as both annoying and corrupt .\n“ About two weeks ago , I stopped watching the news , ” said Bisher . “ Because it was just like , it was too depressing . They ’ re still bitching about the Russia thing , which is still not going to amount to anything .\n“ I feel so much better , for the last two weeks . ”\nBisher was atypical , for allowing that Trump was a “ a bit of a nut ” and saying of a potential Trump 2020 presidential bid : “ Based on what he does this first term , I ’ d say well , if he really is screwing everything up , I wouldn ’ t want him back . ”\nMany Trump supporters give the president far more latitude than Bisher , with some saying that even if Trump had cheated in the election with Russia , the result was still preferable to a Clinton presidency .\n“ I don ’ t know what all was done , ” said Jack Artley , 43 , a machine operator at the Biospectra pharmaceuticals plant in Bangor . “ No matter how it comes out , even if it comes out that there was some shady business going on there , I ’ d rather Trump in there than Clinton . So , whether he had to cheat or not to get in , I ’ m OK with that . ”\n“ If they did , I ’ m actually glad they did , ” John Picard , a carpenter , said of alleged Russian tampering in the election . “ I feel that you shouldn ’ t bother somebody else ’ s country . But the idea that they got all this information and they let it slip out – I ’ m happy if that ’ s true . We got some real good documents on some people who were really messed up , so why not ? ”\nEven as they remain steadfast in their support for the president , many Trump voters have begun to express a disaffection that extends blob-like in every direction . The political establishment is trying to destroy Trump , they say , by flogging what they see as a dubious Russia collusion story , while denying the problem of Democrats they believe have been involved in alleged homegrown election fraud .\nCongress and the justice department are wasting millions of dollars on a politically motivated witch hunt to destroy the president , they feel , after the same establishment gave a pass to the alleged crimes of Clinton and Obama .\nThe media has dropped all pretense of even-handedness to devote itself full time to the president ’ s destruction , they think , driven by a revenge lust for the defeat of Clinton , their preferred candidate .\n“ They can play all these games all they like , but the Trump supporters are not going to ever turn around and say we ’ re concerned about something that has been part of the political process for decades , ” Tom Carroll , a conservative grassroots activist from Bethlehem said of Trump Jr ’ s meeting with Russians to get dirt on Clinton . ( Political activists in both parties have called the meeting extraordinary and possibly unique . )\nWe got fake news , like Trump said , and I ’ m upset with the news . I won ’ t even turn on the television any more Bruce Garis\nCarroll , a criminal defense lawyer and a vice-chairman of the local Tea Party , spoke with ███ in a late afternoon interview on his back deck .\n“ You really talk to people and – you know what drove a lot of people ? ” Carroll said . “ Believe it or not , they won ’ t leave Trump for anything . But it ’ s not because they love Trump , it ’ s because they love their families , they love their country , and they were fearful of what was gon na happen if Hillary Clinton got elected president . ”\nIt is remarkable how Clinton , who has largely stepped away from the national stage after her November loss , still looms in the minds of many Trump voters . A conversation inside the Trolley Shop restaurant in Bangor about whether US intelligence agencies can be trusted – not really , was the general consensus – suddenly turned to Clinton .\n“ Hillary Clinton hurt herself , ” said Mickie Jones , who owns the oldest business in Bangor – a tombstone business – with her husband , Keith . “ She hurt her party , between lies and things that she did . They haven ’ t accepted that . I think she ’ s a liar . And these people don ’ t see that . ”\nKeith Jones , an air force veteran who was stationed in Korea right after the war , said the relationship between Clinton and the media went a long way to explaining the perceived media bias against Trump .\n“ The press has an agenda , and it isn ’ t the same agenda as his , ” Jones said . “ Hillary was their darling , Obama was their darling . And you kick them in the shins there , and they get a little ornery . They ’ re ornery , and they ’ re trying to run Trump into the ground . ”\nBruce Garis , 75 , is a retired heavy equipment operator from Bangor and was a lifelong Democrat , he said , until he voted for Trump .\n“ I switched from Democrat to Republican , because the Democratic party went so far left that they are no more for the working man , ” he said . “ And I feel as if we need somebody in there for the lower-class man .\n“ For all the harassment that ’ s going on , I believe that he ’ s doing what he can do . There ’ s a lot of hindrance there , that shouldn ’ t be . But I ’ m very upset . This is not the America I grew up in . And I ’ d just like things to get better .\n“ We got fake news , like Trump said , and I ’ m upset with the news . I won ’ t even turn on the television any more . ”\nJuly in Northampton County is sunny and leafy , prime time for the pleasures of summer .

So most of the Trump support that we saw last fall in Northampton County still exists , largely as it was .\n“ But if you pull a little bit away under the covers , you see some signs of fraying . And the signs that I see are among those Trump supporters who did so grudgingly last fall . They have some sunken cost in Donald Trump . They supported him . They may have even taken some heat for supporting him from non-Trump supporters in the area . And as they try to hold on to their reasoning and their support and make their case , I think they feel a little weariness , a little tired in their explanation . ”\nMany Trump supporters said that they would abandon their support for the president if undeniable evidence of criminal activity in the Russia matter surfaced – the “ undeniable ” bit , of course , being extremely subjective .\nAs we come to midterm elections , if people are feeling very negative about healthcare as they are now , that can resonate Christopher Borick\nAn issue where Trump seems to be much more vulnerable is healthcare . And unlike on other issues , where chatting with Trump supporters can feel like scrolling through the president ’ s Twitter feed – “ fake news ” , “ witch hunt ” , “ illegal leaks ” , “ voter fraud ” , “ Crooked Hillary ” – Trump voters in Northampton County talk about healthcare with notable measures of nuance , restraint , and human sympathy .\n“ This health issue is a major problem , ” said Mickie Jones . “ I really think they should be settling on that issue . Because there are so many elderly people around the country , and here we are , fighting each other .\n“ They have to do something . They have to . They just have to . And it seems like they ’ re stalling on it . ”\nProspero T Zito , 74 , is another Northampton Democrat who voted for Trump . “ He needs a little more time to get his priorities together , ” Zito said of the president .\nHe believes in the need for health reform , but is worried about the impact on the sick and the poor . “ I think this healthcare is just a little bit out of hand right now . But the people who really need it , that ’ s what I ’ m looking out for . I think they ’ ll straighten it out . Both parties , they ’ ll have to come together . ”\nJohn Griffin , a retired elevator technician and a Republican who voted for Trump , said he was not holding his breath for a bipartisan solution . “ Not gon na happen . It ’ ll never happen , ” he said .\n“ They ’ ll never get together and do it . But if they can get together and do something for the people – not for themselves , but for the people – I ’ ll go along with it . ”\nBorick , the political scientist , said the healthcare issue could damage Republicans or the president in upcoming elections .\n“ We ’ ve polled this issue really heavily for six years , ” said Borick . “ Like many places , Obamacare has reached its zenith in popularity in the commonwealth [ of Pennsylvania ] . It ’ s never been more popular , and the congressional proposals were very unpopular .\n“ That remains a vexing issue for Republicans . And a vexing issue for the president . Talk about issues that could be incredibly damaging , there ’ s a point where people will see in the next two years what kind of effect those changes or lack of changes have .\n“ On the whole it holds enormous peril , much more peril than promise for both the Republicans and the president .

    "213": "Washington ( CNN ) – The beleaguered Republican Party put into writing Monday what many of its top strategists and leaders have been saying since last year 's election losses : The GOP is too old , too white , and too insular to win national contests .\nIn a months-in-the-making report - which tops out at 100 pages and includes hundreds of recommended fixes - the Republican National Committee acknowledges its messaging problems , identifies structural setbacks to the primary calendar and spells out how to target specific demographic groups that voted overwhelmingly for Democrats in 2012 .\n`` The report notes the way we communicate our principles isn ’ t resonating widely enough , '' RNC Chairman Reince Priebus , who also happened to be celebrating his birthday , said at the report 's release in Washington . `` Focus groups described our party as 'narrow minded , ' 'out of touch , ' and 'Stuffy old men . ' I ’ m only 41 , by the way . Today . ''\n`` It all goes back to what our moms used to tell us : It 's not just what we say ; it 's how we say it , '' Priebus continued . `` The promise of opportunity will be our message , and a spirit of optimism will infuse everything that we do . ''\nThe report was initiated by the RNC soon after last November 's vote , which saw Republicans lose the presidency as well as seats in the U.S. House . Mitt Romney , the party 's White House hopeful , lost big among Latinos , African-Americans and Asians , a fact that helped spur collective soul searching among the party 's leaders .\n`` Public perception of the Party is at record lows , '' the report states . `` Young voters are increasingly rolling their eyes at what the Party represents , and many minorities wrongly think that Republicans do not like them or want them in the country . When someone rolls their eyes at us , they are not likely to open their ears to us . ''\nRomney won only 27 % of Latino voters - a lower percentage than the last two GOP presidential candidates . Many pointed to Romney 's hardline stance on immigration , including his endorsement of a policy of `` self-deportation , '' as a reason .\nIn Monday 's report , that policy was specifically shunned as a turnoff for voters who could potentially vote Republican .\n`` If Hispanic Americans perceive that a GOP nominee or candidate does not want them in the United States ( i.e . self-deportation ) , they will not pay attention to our next sentence , '' it states . In one of its few policy recommendations , the report counsels Republicans to `` embrace and champion '' comprehensive immigration reform .\nAnd in order to attract young voters , the party recommends a `` change in tone , '' particularly on social issues .\n`` In every session with young voters , social issues were at the forefront of the discussion ; many see them as the civil rights issues of our time . We must be a party that is welcoming and inclusive for all voters , '' it states , adding later that it 's imperative that young people not regard the GOP as `` totally intolerant of alternative points of view . ''\n`` Our policies are sound , but I think that in many ways the way that we communicate can be a real problem , '' Priebus said at the report 's release .\nHe continued , `` Decent people can disagree on issues . I do n't agree with my wife on 100 % of the issues , but it does n't mean we do n't have a good marriage . I think that we have to be a welcoming party . I think that we have to have a party that says , 'If you want to support our party and you want to walk through that door , I do n't need to agree with you on every single issue . ' ''\n`` Republican Party is , indeed , a big tent , '' said Ari Fleischer , a CNN contributor who was one of the report 's authors , on Monday . `` We need to make sure that 's a big tent , and not just rhetoric . ''\n`` Take the issue of gay marriage , for example , and gay rights . There is a genuine generational split in the Republican Party on that issue . Many , many young conservatives are for gay rights , are for gay marriage . And we openly talk about that and acknowledge that and we welcome that . That 's part of what a big tent should be about , '' Fleischer said on CNN 's `` Starting Point . ''\nThe party 's primary process has also generated problems for Republicans , the report finds , including the months-long primary process that saw candidates ripping each other in front of too many debates .\nThe number of debates should be cut in half , the report recommends , and the Republican National Convention should be moved earlier in the summer , so that the party 's presidential candidate can start using RNC money earlier - the candidate is prevented from using those funds until they are officially nominated at the convention .\nAlso necessary , according to the report : a more robust digital effort , including the creation of a chief technology and digital officer for the RNC , to compete with Democrats online .\n`` Digital can simply no longer be an afterthought in our campaigns , '' the report states . `` It has to be embedded in every function and backed up with appropriate staffing and funding .

    "214": "Conservative Supreme Court Justices expressed strong reservations today about a key provision of the Voting Rights Act that is intended to protect the rights of minorities and suggested it could be in danger .\nThat section of the landmark 1965 law says that certain states , mostly in the South , must get any changes to voting regulations precleared by federal officials in Washington , D.C .\nRELATED : Challenge to the Voting Rights Act Reaches Supreme Court\nSolicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. began arguments at the Court Wednesday by saying that the Voting Rights Act `` made a huge difference in transforming the culture of blatantly racist vote suppression that characterized parts of this country for a century . Section 5 preclearance was the principal engine of that progress . ''\nBut Chief Justice John Roberts expressed concern that Congress , when reauthorizing the law in 2006 for 25 more years , used an outdated `` coverage formula '' that singled out only a few states , mostly in the South . He asked Verrilli : `` Is it the government 's submission that the citizens in the South are more racist than citizens in the North ? ''\nThe jurisdictions covered under the law include Alabama , Alaska , Arizona , Georgia , Louisiana , Mississippi , South Carolina , Texas and Virginia , as well as portions of California , Florida , Michigan , New Hampshire , New York , North Carolina and South Dakota .\nJustice Samuel Alito said , `` There 's no question that the Voting Rights Act has done enormous good . '' But he said that when Congress reauthorized it , it should have considered a new determination of which states should be covered . `` Maybe the whole country should be covered . Or maybe certain parts of the country should be covered based on a formula that is grounded in up-to-date statistics , `` he said .\nJustice Antonin Scalia spoke at length about the fact that the 2006 congressional vote to reauthorized the act was nearly unanimous .\n`` I think it is attributable , very likely attributable , to a phenomenon that is called perpetuation of racial entitlement . It 's been written about . Whenever a society adopts racial entitlements , it is very difficult to get out of them through the normal political processes .\n`` And I am fairly confident it will be re-enacted in perpetuity unless a court can say it does not comport with the Constitution , '' he continued . `` You have to show , when you are treating different states differently , that there 's a good reason for it. ``\nScalia said , `` That 's the concern that those of us who have some questions about this statute have . It 's a concern that this is not the kind of a question you can leave to Congress . ''\nAfter the dialogue , Roberts gave Verrilli an extra five minutes . `` Thank you , '' Verrilli said , smiling . `` I may need it for that question . ''\n`` We are talking about the enforcement power that the Constitution gives to the Congress to make these judgments to ensure protection of fundamental rights , '' said Verrilli .\nHe added that he thought it would be `` extraordinary '' to look behind the judgment of Congress on the basis of `` that sort of motive analysis . ''\nScalia 's question bothered Justice Sonia Sotomayor who later asked a lawyer for Shelby County , Ala. , `` Do you think Section 5 was voted for because it was a racial entitlement ? '' And she also said , `` Do you think that racial discrimination in voting has ended and there is none anywhere ? ``\nSotomayor , one of the four liberals on the court , emerged as one of the most vocal defenders of the law .\nBert W. Rein , the attorney challenging Section 5 , said that the South had changed and that the coverage formula should not have been reauthorized .\nBut Sotomayor cut him off . She said that even if some portions of the South had changed , `` your county pretty much has n't . ''\n`` Why would we vote in favor of a county whose record is the epitome of what caused the passage of this law to start with , '' she asked .\nJustice Anthony Kennedy , who could be a crucial vote , asked a question that showed skepticism of Rein 's position . He referred to Alabama 's history of discrimination and noted that the state might be considered under any coverage formula .\nBut as he had previously stated in a related case in 2009 , Kennedy seemed concerned about the federalist implications of the law on the states . At one point he compared Alabama 's sovereignty with the `` trusteeship of the United States government . ''\nJustice Elena Kagan defended the 15,000-page legislative record Congress developed after holding 21 hearings . `` It 's hard to see how Congress could have developed a better and more thorough legislative record than it did , '' she said .\nJustice Clarence Thomas said nothing during arguments , but in 2009 he said he believed Section 5 `` exceeded Congress ' power to enforce the 15th Amendment . ''\nIn the audience were prominent civil rights activists , including the Rev . Jesse Jackson , the Rev . Al Sharpton , Rep. John Lewis , D-Ga. , and Cecilia Marshall , the widow of former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall .\nProtesters gathered on the steps outside the court before arguments began . They held signs with such messages as `` Protect My Vote , '' and `` My Vote , Our Rights , Our Fight . ''\nDemonstrators from the Alliance for Justice lined up in front of the Supreme Court steps .\nJackson , Sharpton and Lewis spoke for the group , and were joined by Rep. Marcia Fudge , D-Ohio , House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , Rep. Judy Chu , D-Calif. , and Ruben Hinojos , D-Texas , among others .\nFudge , chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus , had a clear retort to the arguments against Section 5 : `` You will not win . You will not win this battle . ''\nSharpton ended his remarks with : `` They do n't use white sheets anymore , they use black robes .

    "216": "Amazon is implementing a one-year moratorium on police use of its artificial intelligence software Rekognition amid a growing backlash over the tech company ’ s ties to law enforcement .\nThe company has recently stated its support for the Black Lives Matter movement , which advocates for police reform – using Twitter to call for an end to “ the inequitable and brutal treatment of black people ” in the US and has putting a “ Black lives matter ” banner at the top of its home page . But the company has been criticized as hypocritical because it sells its facial recognition software to police forces .\nAmazon has not said how many police forces use the technology , or how it is used , but marketing materials have promoted Rekognition being used in conjunction with police body cameras in real time .\nWhen it was first released , Amazon ’ s Rekognition software was criticized by human rights groups as “ a powerful surveillance system ” that is available to “ violate rights and target communities of color ” . Advocacy groups also said the technology could have a disproportionately negative effect on non-white people . Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez echoed this complaint in a tweet on Wednesday , saying the technology “ shouldn ’ t be anywhere near law enforcement ” .\n“ Facial recognition is a horrifying , inaccurate tool that fuels racial profiling and mass surveillance , ” she said . “ It regularly falsely [ identifies ] Black and Brown people as criminal ” .\nAn experiment run by the ACLU in 2018 showed Rekognition incorrectly matched 28 members of Congress to photos of people arrested for a crime . It overwhelmingly misidentified Congress members who are not white . Facial recognition software , like many forms of artificial intelligence , has a long history of racial bias . The field of artificial intelligence , which is overwhelmingly white and male , is frequently criticized for its lack of diversity .\nIn a statement on its blog Wednesday , Amazon said it will pull the use of its technology from police forces until there is stronger regulation around it . The move follows IBM putting a permanent end to its development of facial recognition technology .\n“ We ’ ve advocated that governments should put in place stronger regulations to govern the ethical use of facial recognition technology , and in recent days , Congress appears ready to take on this challenge , ” Amazon said . “ We hope this one-year moratorium might give Congress enough time to implement appropriate rules , and we stand ready to help if requested . ”\nWhile some privacy advocates say the move represents a step in the right direction , Evan Greer , of digital rights group Fight for the Future , said this is “ nothing more than a public relations stunt from Amazon ” .\nShe said Amazon could spend the year moratorium improving the technology and lobbying Congress to make industry-friendly regulation so the technology can be implemented in the future . Amazon spent $ 16.8m on lobbying in 2019 .\n“ The reality is that facial recognition technology is too dangerous to be used at all , ” Greer said . “ Like nuclear or biological weapons , it poses such a profound threat to the future of humanity that it should be banned outright . ”\nNicole Ozer , the technology and civil liberties director with the American Civil Liberties Union of northern California , also called on Amazon to make more meaningful commitments . “ This surveillance technology ’ s threat to our civil rights and civil liberties will not disappear in a year , ” Ozer said . “ Amazon must fully commit to a blanket moratorium on law enforcement use of face recognition until the dangers can be fully addressed , and it must press Congress and legislatures across the country to do the same . They should also commit to stop selling surveillance systems like Ring that fuel the over-policing of communities of color .\nThe Washington county sheriff ’ s office in Oregon , the first law enforcement agency in the country to contract with Amazon to use the technology , confirmed on Wednesday it would suspend its use of the product in light of the announcement .\nSuspension of this particular program does not mean all partnerships with law enforcement will be halted . Amazon noted in its announcement that the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children , as well as technology companies Thorn and Marinus Analytics , will still have access to Rekognition for human trafficking cases .\nAmazon also has not made changes to Ring , its camera-connected smart doorbell company , which has also been criticized for increasing the policing of non-white Americans . A report from Motherboard in 2019 revealed black and brown people are more likely to be surveilled by the Neighbors app , where Ring users can post videos and photos of “ suspicious ” people caught on camera .\nThe doorbell app now partners with more than 1,300 police forces across the US – a 300 % increase from just 400 police forces in August 2019 . The ACLU has called on Amazon to “ stop selling surveillance systems like Ring that fuel the over-policing of communities of color ” . It also called on other companies that power facial recognition , including Microsoft , to halt the technology .\n“ Face recognition technology gives governments the unprecedented power to spy on us wherever we go , ” said Ozer . “ It fuels police abuse .

    "217": "( CNN ) – The No . 2 Democrat in the Senate criticized the National Rifle Association for cheering the defeat of a recent bipartisan gun control measure and expressed hope that the “ political sentiment ” will change in the upper chamber so the legislation can be brought up again .\n“ The National Rifle Association can go to Texas and celebrate defeating that measure , but they certainly shouldn ’ t celebrate when they look at the carnage that takes place virtually every day in America because convicted felons have guns , ” Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois said Sunday on CNN ’ s “ State of the Union . ”\nHe was referring to the organization ’ s annual meeting this weekend in Houston , where the recent gun control debate was a key theme among speeches by high-profile conservatives . Speakers praised the audience for lobbying their lawmakers to vote against gun control measures and encouraged them to keep up the fight .\n`` We are in the midst of a once-in-a-generation fight for everything we care about . We have a chance to secure our freedom for a generation , or to lose it forever , '' NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre said Saturday .\n`` We must remain vigilant , ever resolute , and steadfastly growing and preparing for the even more critical battles that loom before us , '' he said .\nOne of the main provisions considered the most likely to pass would have expanded the background check system to include private sales at gun shows and online . In the April 17 vote , however , the Senate fell short of the 60 votes needed to move forward with the measure . Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid shelved the overall gun control bill to allow more time for negotiations and vowed to bring it up again .\nThe defeat was seen as a major victory among anti-gun control advocates and among those in the gun lobby , who argued that the measure would not have done much to help prevent mass shootings like those seen in Newtown , Connecticut , and Aurora , Colorado , last year .\nDurbin , the Senate ’ s majority whip , said the legislation needs five more votes in order to pass but said it can be an uphill battle in the Senate .\n`` What we need to see is a change in political sentiment within the Senate . We need to pick up five more votes , and that 's quite a task , I might add , as whip in the Senate , but we can do this . I hope the American people do n't give up .

    "218": "Pastor Jerry Morrell was not playing to his audience . “ I was asked if Donald Trump is a man of God , ” the evangelical preacher told the congregation of The Way of Holiness church on the outskirts of Buckhannon , West Virginia . “ I said : ‘ No , I don ’ t see him as a man of God . Or , at this point , a godly man . I think he ’ s a man whose heart can be touched by God . I think he may be open to that ’ . ”\nA silence fell . The cries of acclamation greeting much of the Pentecostal pastor ’ s sermon drained away .\n“ Y ’ all got real quiet when I said that but I have to tell it like it is , ” Morrell pressed on . “ I ’ m praying for our president . Let him have the wisdom not to say some things and not to put some things out on Twitter , ” he said . “ We ask you to set a guard over Mr Trump ’ s mouth and Twitter ” .\nCleveland 's dividing lines over race issues come to light under Trump Read more\nOn that , there was agreement . Eighty percent of white evangelicals backed Trump for president , but worshippers at The Way of Holiness church were not without their doubts .\n“ To be honest with you , I voted for Trump but if I ’ d had another choice I probably would not have , ” said Thrayron Morgan , a grandmother from a military family attending church that day . I pointed out there was another choice : Hillary Clinton . “ No ! That ’ s not my other choice . We ’ ve had enough of that , ” she said with a laugh . “ It was very difficult for me . Very difficult . In fact it was a toss-up between not voting at all and voting for him . I really had to pray about that . ”\nMorgan had lots of problems with Trump but a big one was the way he spoke about women and immigrants . “ I don ’ t think he should talk about people like that . Even the homosexuals , you hate the sin not the sinner . As a Christian , I don ’ t believe in treating people the way he treated some people , ” she said .\nMorgan ’ s mind was made up by the supreme court . She wants to see a court “ following Godly principles ” and she had little doubt that Clinton would have nominated the wrong kind of justices . “ That ’ s important to me . On abortion number one . Same-sex marriage . Anything to do with either one of those . And I have a feeling there may be some issues come up even later that may touch on Christian principles too . I have no clue what , but you never know when something might come up that ’ s against my beliefs , ” she said .\nIn parts of West Virginia , it is said there are two reasons to vote : God and coal . Both have been in retreat for years . In a state where families still pray at the restaurant dinner table , and mines were once the engine of prosperity , Trump won with the promise of revival .\nBut there ’ s a paradox . Evangelicals may doubt Trump ’ s commitment to God , but they calculate he will be good for their push to inject more religion into American life . On the other hand , those who voted for Trump because he promised to bring back coalmines often admire his business skills – but they do have doubts about whether he can deliver .\nSo far , conservative Christians have not had reason to be disappointed . Trump ’ s appointment of evangelicals to his cabinet – including an attorney general who advocates an end to the wall between church and state , and an education secretary who wants to “ advance God ’ s kingdom ” through public funding of religious schools – has sent the right signals . And just in case Trump veers off course , evangelicals are counting on Mike Pence , an advocate of teaching creationism alongside Darwinism , to steer the president straight .\n“ We are very much right-to-life people and Trump seems to be more favorable toward that point of view than former administrations , ” said Morrell . “ We love people of all beliefs and backgrounds , and yet we also want to have the liberty of believing marriage is between a man and a woman , and to hold to that conviction without being sued for discrimination . Sometimes that ’ s painted in such a negative way when it used to be everyone ’ s view . Sometimes on the right we ’ re painted as racists and bigots and haters . We ’ re not , but we want to be allowed to hold to traditional values . ”\nThe pastor acknowledges that Trump does not live by those same values . Of the president ’ s boasting about touching women ’ s genitals , he said that “ it bothered me tremendously . I ’ m a father of four daughters and I have a lovely wife I want to be respected . But I attribute that to being in his past , ” he said . “ I do wish he would do a better job of reaching out to his opposition and not lashing out . I do believe we need to work together as a nation regardless of our beliefs . I really am concerned about the racial strife that has gotten worse over the last eight years . ”\nFor that , Morrell blames Barack Obama . “ The former administration , in continually emphasizing our differences instead of what we have in common , created an us and them atmosphere , and it has happened not only racially but among political parties and on the lines of wealth and poor . It ’ s been us and them when it needs to be us as Americans , ” the pastor said .\nObama gets blamed for a lot more : his remarks about working-class people clinging to religion and guns during his first run for the White House festered right through his presidency . And , more than anything , he became known as the man who killed the mines .\nIt ’ s an article of faith in West Virginia that Obama ’ s “ war on coal ” put mines out of business . The industry helped push the claim by resisting Environmental Protection Agency regulations , which are widely viewed as a plot to make coalmining unviable .\nTrump , on the other hand , promised to revive the mines that once provided a good living for much of this part of Appalachia . On 28 March , he signed orders rolling back measures to combat global warming , including pollution restrictions on coal-fired power plants and lifting a moratorium on new coal leases on federal lands in an effort to boost the mining industry . The move came days after he told a rally in Kentucky that he was rolling back regulations : “ We are going to put our coalminers back to work . ”\nIn the southern part of the state , people are already talking about how more coal trucks are on the move . But a good number of Trump supporters doubt the mines will ever be revived : they just don ’ t see the economics working . Still , they back Trump because he talked about their problems when they feel virtually invisible to the national political class . More than a few supported Bernie Sanders for the same reason .\nRobin Jeran , who ran the kind of small-scale mines that once dotted West Virginia , voted for Trump but he doubts coal is making a comeback . “ We were very fortunate through the years to be able to work steady , but as time went on I could see it coming . The little guy ’ s going to get squeezed out . You don ’ t have the money behind you to stay in business when they keep passing more stringent laws , ” he said .\nJeran ’ s family ran 10 mines over nearly three decades . Mostly they dug several hundred feet into a hillside , employing a few dozen miners at a time . When one mine ’ s coal was exhausted , usually within three or four years , they moved on to another . Back then , coal provided a decent wage . “ Decent income . Health benefits , ” said Jeran . “ At one time we used to say that for every guy that you employed there was another eight or 10 people out there in service industries that supplied you that you fed . ”\nJeran went out of business in 2009 , the year Obama moved into the White House . He said his mines were killed by a confluence of low coal prices , falling demand , competition from natural gas and increased regulation , particularly after two local mine disasters . In 2006 , 12 miners were killed in an explosion at the deep Sago mine just outside Buckhannon – an operation owned by Wilbur Ross , a billionaire banker who is now Trump ’ s commerce secretary . Four years later , 29 men died in a coal dust explosion at the Upper Big Branch mine . The tragedies prompted new state safety regulations after it was revealed that both mines were repeatedly cited for violations . The new measures included the building of underground emergency shelters .\nJeran said it was one cost too many for small mines like his . “ At the time I never thought we needed any of that stuff . Still don ’ t . They made us spend hoards of money on shelters underground . Communication devices . Tracking devices . They can ’ t prove it ’ s saved any lives , any of this stuff . But it really added tremendous costs to a small coalmine because everybody had to have the same stuff no matter how small you were , ” he said . He calculates that regulation added several dollars to a ton of coal at a time when prices were rock bottom , driving his and other mines out of business .\nThen came Obama . The president did not begin coal ’ s troubles , but the former mine owner reckons he put the final nail in the coffin of small-scale operations with environmental regulations . “ He definitely destroyed the coal business . He made up his mind to do it , ” he said .\nBut Jeran doubts that Trump , for all his promises , can reverse the long-term decline .\n“ To me there ’ ll always be some work for coal but I don ’ t ever see it coming back the way it did , ” he said . “ Most of the good easy coal to mine in West Virginia is long gone so everything is more difficult , deeper , lot more rock in the coal seams . As they keep changing the power plants from coal to gas , and the gas has gotten so cheap , I think the gas is going to work the coalminers out now . ”\nThe loss of the mines is keenly felt . Jeran ’ s workers typically earned more than $ 80,000 a year . In the 1970s , pay in West Virginia was above the national average . By the turn of the millennium , with mining collapsing , wages had fallen far behind most of America and low-paying Walmart was the state ’ s biggest employer .\nThe numbers of people dependent on welfare , including food stamps , rose . Nearly 15 % of West Virginia residents receive disability payments , the highest of any state . The mine at Sago closed , leaving behind the hoists and headgear as markers of what once was , and a black granite memorial in the town to the dead . Other small towns just a few miles outside of Buckhannon are grappling with the consequences of lost mines as mortgage foreclosures and bankruptcies drove people from their homes and businesses .\nJeran readily admits that he does not know what the solution is , but he likes the idea of the government in the hands of a businessman with a focus on what ’ s good for Americans . “ The government wastes so much money it ’ s unbelievable . It just drives you crazy . We ’ re out trying to save the world all the time and we don ’ t take care of our own . We shouldn ’ t have people starving , homeless . Let ’ s shrink it back in and take care of us . My golly , this idea that we ’ re the know it all , good all hasn ’ t proved out . All we do is get our foot in the door , get a whole bunch of people killed , defending what ? What have we accomplished in Afghanistan or any of these places ? ”\n‘ Fuck the United States . They ’ re the most cruelest country there is ’\nThe belief that America ’ s leaders have been more interested in foreign adventures than looking after those at the bottom of the pile back home runs through many West Virginia communities .\nRicky Farnsworth flies a Confederate battle flag from an improvised steel rod flagpole outside his trailer home . When I ask why he ’ s hoisted such a divisive symbol in a state mostly carved out of Virginia to join the Union cause , he smiles .\n“ I will not fly an American flag other than that one . I would rather have a Chinese flag , a Japanese flag , a Russian flag . Fuck the United States . They ’ re the most cruelest country there is . Letting your own people starve and sending aid overseas . Going over and killing people in other countries and then building them back up . What business did we have in Vietnam ? What business did we have in Iraq ? ” he said .\nFarnsworth used to work on oil rigs but the toll of injuries , including a lost finger , and the general wearing down of his body forced him out of a job . Now , at 59 , he lives on a little more than a $ 1,000 a month in disability payments . Farnsworth is an unflinching if maverick Trump supporter . He denounces the rich but believes the billionaire president will Make America Great Again . He speaks of Obama as “ the black guy ” and said he knows for sure the former president is not American . Yet he supports Obamacare and doesn ’ t understand why the US can ’ t replicate Canada ’ s health system .\n“ Money don ’ t excite me . I don ’ t worry about it even though I don ’ t have it . I don ’ t hardly buy food because it ’ s too damn expensive , ” he said . “ I go to the diner and eat a little bit . Two beets , a half spoonful of bacon bits , a half spoonful of shredded cheese . I ’ ll put a little bit of coleslaw , a little bit of cottage cheese . Four peaches . I ’ ll eat that . I ate that yesterday . I ain ’ t eaten nothing since that . I won ’ t eat nothing today . That ’ s what I live on. ” That and a steady supply of chewing tobacco .\nFarnsworth sees Trump ’ s wealth as evidence that he is looking out for ordinary Americans .\n“ Why would he downgrade himself if he didn ’ t want to help the United States ? His home was more valuable than the White House , ” he said .\nThe retired oil worker regards taxes with the same scorn as much of conservative America , although his objection comes with a twist not so often heard among Republicans . Why , he asks , should the poor pay taxes when the rich don ’ t contribute their fair share ? Yet Farnsworth doesn ’ t blame Trump for avoiding taxes with his business manoeuverings .\n“ He didn ’ t pay taxes but he went by the law . He did not steal off the government . He went by the law because he was a smart man , ” he said .\nStill , Farnsworth isn ’ t keen to let the point go . He doesn ’ t see why the Internal Revenue Service is making demands of a man like himself getting by hand to mouth .\n“ Why don ’ t they go and get their money from the billions they spent in Iraq ? ”\n‘ I did not join the army to act as a mercenary for oil ’\nLike evangelicals , a clear majority of military veterans voted for Trump . Sergeant Ron Frye wasn ’ t one of them . The 48-year-old army veteran stepped on a booby trap in Iraq in 2003 . He spent eight months in a coma , lost the use of his legs and is now in a wheelchair . It has left him in unending pain .\n“ I understood Afghanistan . Iraq , I never understood why we were there . I know why the president claimed we went to Iraq but there were so many shady background issues involved in it that I ’ ve just come to believe that the only reason we went to Iraq was all about money and oil . I joined the army to protect America and preserve freedom for those around the world who asked for our assistance . I did not join the army to act as a mercenary for oil , ” he said .\n“ When I came back from Iraq after I got blown up , I swore I would never vote for another Republican because they ’ d already stolen my legs . So I supported Barack Obama . I thought he was the second coming of JFK . Well into his first term , I realised I was sadly mistaken so I said I would never support the Democratic party again , ” he said .\nThen came the 2016 election . “ I looked at it and said you can vote for the Wicked Witch of the West or you can vote for the King of the Oompa-Loompas . I finally decided on Clinton because I thought in a politically savvy sense she was far more qualified than Donald Trump . I saw how the country voted and I thought , oh my God . At first I was inclined to think we ’ ve elected the second Adolf Hitler . ”\nFrye lives in a small house on a street populated by veterans who served as far back as the second world war . His views are not widely shared either among his neighbours or many others in Buckhannon .\n“ I ’ m a loud , egotistical , self-centred cripple and I can say anything I want and nobody can do a damn thing about it because then they would be seen as being the guy who picks on the wounded vet , ” he said . “ It ’ s the only liberating thing about being in a wheelchair , being able to state whatever I want , however I want , without anybody trying to shout me down . ”\nFrye said he will give Trump six months to see if the new president is as bad as he fears , but he ’ s not getting his hopes up . “ He ’ s stirred up so much animosity that unless you came over on the Mayflower you can not be sure you ’ re not going to get targeted by him , ” he said . “ To have fought for freedom , equality , democracy – all these things held so dear – and then to have somebody being elected who seems to support the exact opposite of that – hatred , inequality , the segregation … It ’ s as if we ’ re taking a step back to the 1950s . ”\nFrye fears that might also apply to policies toward working conditions and the environment . He lost family in the Sago mine disaster . One of his wife ’ s cousins , Fred Ware , was asphyxiated and another , Randal McCloy , was the sole survivor and permanently injured .\n“ I ’ m not out to save the whales and I ’ m not out to hug a bunch of trees . But I certainly don ’ t want my children to live the way I had to live , growing up in an Irish family in West Virginia , working in the coalmines . I don ’ t want to see any more of my relatives die of black lung , ” he said . “ I would love to see economic growth for West Virginia . I just don ’ t want to see economic growth for West Virginia at the cost of West Virginia itself . There has to be a middle ground and in America finding a middle ground is probably far more difficult than any other country . ”\n‘ Now those with the most fear those with the least ’\nWest Virginia was once solidly Democratic . Although Trump won every county , the state has not entirely turned its back on the party . A Democrat , Jim Justice , was elected governor in the same ballot , although it helped that he is a conservative billionaire mine owner . Democrats also hold five of the six directly elected offices including secretary of state . But the GOP tide is pushing in . A Republican was elected to one of the seats in the US Senate in 2015 for the first time in 60 years and all three of the state ’ s seats in Congress have flipped to the party since the turn of the millennium .\n“ There ’ s always been a class and caste system . America ’ s supposed to be the class-free country . The only thing is the classes here have to be far more subtle , ” said Frye , the veteran . “ Now those with the most fear those with the least . And while saying that we need to equalize the system they spend all their time and resources secretly distancing themselves more to protect themselves from the hatred of the faceless majority . ”\nJeran , the former mine owner , reckons West Virginia should naturally lean to the Democrats . He blames Obama ’ s policies for the party ’ s fall , although he said the former president ’ s race contributed to the hostility towards him .\nIn central California , it 's neighbour versus neighbour on Trump Read more\nStill , there ’ s one Obama legacy a lot of West Virginians are not keen to see erased . Farnsworth , the Trump supporter , liked Obama ’ s healthcare reform although he would like to have seen it go further . “ The US can afford for everyone to have insurance . Canada does and these other smaller countries that ain ’ t as rich , they can do that . Why can ’ t the US ? Because it ’ s too mean . Highfalutin motherfuckers in the government wants to send all this aid and stuff overseas , ” he said .\nJeran broadly backed Obamacare . He said it ’ s flawed but he doesn ’ t want to see it swept away without an alternative . “ It was a good thing for people that wanted to get insurance and get it at a reasonable price . I had Obamacare when I quit for a couple of years but these insurance companies they just change stuff and they jack it up . Same with pharmacy . The drug prices in this country , it just drives you crazy , ” he said . “ To me , you got ta do something . This idea that we ’ re just going to get rid of Obamacare and we don ’ t have anything in place , I don ’ t like that . ”\nAs for Making America Great Again , Sgt Frye is doubtful . “ America never stopped being great . America stopped believing in itself and caring about itself , ” he said . “ We became so disgruntled and bitter and concentrated on the fact that our politicians were a bunch of lying , conniving scum that we ceased having pride in our country ’ s achievements and became focused on our failures . Until we learn to start being proud of the positive things we achieve , we will never be great again in our own eyes . And if you can not love yourself , how can anyone else love you ? ”\nThat ’ s a sentiment Morgan , the evangelical and conservative grandmother , agrees with – although she sees it through a different prism .\n“ We ’ ve really turned away from God as a nation and when a nation does that , God has a hard time blessing a nation that is turning its back on him , ” she said . “ I want to bring God back into our government . I know church and state to a point needs to be separated but I think it needs to come together too in order for God to bless the nation . I want to see prayer in school . Bring back those things that have been removed so that the next generation are taught godly principles . ”\nMorgan realises that ’ s a big ask , but she thinks Trump may be the man to make it happen . For all that , she can ’ t decide if he ’ s a religious man or just an opportunist .\n“ That ’ s up in the air , in my opinion . I don ’ t know depending on what day you ask me , ” she said . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "219": "Former Taliban prisoner Sgt . Bowe Bergdahl pleaded guilty to charges of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy after a short military hearing at Fort Bragg , North Carolina , on Monday after expressing doubts that he could get a fair trial after campaign statements by Donald Trump .\nInterested in Bowe Bergdahl ? Add Bowe Bergdahl as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Bowe Bergdahl news , video , and analysis from ███ . Add Interest\nDespite surviving five years in a Taliban cage , Bergdahl , Trump said in several campaign speeches as a presidential candidate , was a `` traitor '' who should be executed .\nIn an on-camera interview shot last year by a British filmmaker , obtained exclusively by ███ and airing today on `` Good Morning America , '' `` World News Tonight With David Muir '' and `` Nightline , '' Bergdahl says the words of the man who is now his commander in chief would have made a fair trial impossible .\n`` We may as well go back to kangaroo courts and lynch mobs that got what they wanted , '' Bergdahl says . `` The people who want to hang me — you 're never going to convince those people . ''\nBergdahl , a 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment trooper , walked off his combat outpost in Afghanistan in June 2009 and was quickly captured by the Taliban . During his five years in captivity with the Haqqani Network — the same Taliban faction that held American Caitlan Coleman and her family hostage for five years until they were freed last Wednesday — he endured what one U.S. official called the worst case of prisoner abuse since the Vietnam War .\nHe was released in 2014 in exchange for five Taliban prisoners at Guantanamo Bay — a deal that was harshly criticized on the campaign trail by then-candidate Trump , who called Bergdahl `` garbage '' and even suggested that he should have been summarily executed .\n`` You know , in the old days — bing , bong , '' Trump said as he mimicked firing a rifle . `` When we were strong . ''\nSpeaking to British war filmmaker Sean Langan , who was held captive by the same Taliban group in 2008 , Bergdahl says he wants to fight back against what he calls a false narrative fueled by conservative outlets like Fox News that sought to portray him as a traitor and jihadi sympathizer who had been persuaded to fight against the United States alongside his captors .\n`` You know , it 's just insulting , frankly , '' Bergdahl tells Langan . `` It 's very insulting , the idea that they would think I did that . ''\nIn 2014 , then–Fox News correspondents Megyn Kelly and James Rosen reported on `` secret documents '' obtained by the network that purported to show Bergdahl had `` shown affection '' for his captors , converted to Islam and become a `` mujahid , '' or jihadi .\nAccording to Bergdahl , however , he thought the conditions in captivity might kill him before his captors could .\n`` It was getting so bad that I was literally looking at myself , you know , looking at joints , looking my ribs and just going , ' I 'm going to die here from sickness , or I can die escaping , ' '' he says . `` You know , it did n't really matter . ''\nHe attempted to escape twice , according to military officials , and he was severely punished after being recaptured . Terrence Russell , a military official who debriefs former U.S. captives for the U.S. Joint Personnel Recovery Agency , says Bergdahl was tortured in a way reminiscent of the brutality visited upon prisoners of war in Vietnam decades ago .\n`` When they recaptured him and brought him back , the next day they spread-eagled and secured him to a metal bed frame , '' Russell says to Langan in another video . `` They took a plastic pipe … and they started beating his feet and his legs repeatedly with this plastic pipe … The idea was to just beat him and injure his legs and his feet so that he could not walk away again . ''\nBergdahl also says he was confined for more than four years to a cage that was only 7 feet by 6 feet .\n`` From first year , '' Bergdahl says when asked how much time he spent in that cage . `` So second , third , fourth and then into the fifth year . ''\nIt remains a mystery , however , why he walked off his post .\nAnother senior official who spoke to Langan for his documentary was retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn , who , as the former head of intelligence for special operations in Afghanistan and then as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency , was deeply involved in the early search for Bergdahl .\nHe also briefly served as Trump 's national security adviser after working on his campaign , and he tells Langan that he `` absolutely '' believes Bergdahl left his base with the intention to meet the Taliban .\nBut Bergdahl disputes that , saying in a taped conversation with filmmaker Mark Boal that was broadcast in the second season of the `` Serial '' podcast that he walked off post in an attempt to report to senior officers that his platoon commander was `` unfit '' for his position .\nBergdahl has not been charged with any crime related to aiding the enemy .\nWhatever his reasons were , at least two soldiers were seriously wounded during the search to find him , as ███ first reported in 2014 . In response to questions from Army Judge Col. Jeffery Nance on Monday , Bergdahl admitted multiple times that he did not fully appreciate the enormity of his actions .\n`` At the time , I had no thoughts anyone would come searching for me … however looking back I see it was a very obvious mistake , ” Bergdahl said . “ I believed they would notice me missing , but I did n't think they would pull off a crucial mission to look for one private . ''\nAfter his guilty plea , the question remaining before the military is what form of punishment Bergdahl deserves . On that question , even Flynn doubts that justice would be best served by putting a former prisoner back in prison .\n`` So the guy deserted his men , his soldiers , his squad — no doubt , '' Flynn says . `` [ But ] I do n't think he should serve another day in any sort of confinement or jail or anything like that , because frankly , even though he put himself into this situation to a degree , we — the United States government and the United States military — put him in Afghanistan .

It makes me mildly nauseous to think we might have had some impact on the election . But honestly , I wouldn ’ t change the decision . ”\nThe FBI director said that the discovery in October of a new batch classified emails put him in a near impossible dilemma . He said he had to make a choice between “ speak or conceal ” : to speak would have been “ really bad ” , he said ; to conceal would have been “ catastrophic ” . So he chose to speak out .\n“ One of my junior lawyers asked me : should you consider what you do might help elect Trump as president ? I said : not for a moment , ” Comey said , arguing that political considerations should never be a factor in such decisions .\nTrump responded to Clinton ’ s comments on Tuesday with a tweet claiming : “ FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds ! ” – an apparent reference to the bureau ’ s finding that there was nothing to prosecute in the emails case .\nAsked about the criticism on Wednesday , the White House spokesman , Sean Spicer , told journalists : “ The president has confidence in the director . ”\nHe was asked repeatedly about the contrast between his decision to break silence on the Clinton email case while concealing the existence of a counter-intelligence investigation into the Trump campaign ’ s contacts with Russian officials during the election .\nComey said that when he first spoke about the Clinton case , in July 2016 , he did so because the investigation had been closed , no charges had been made , and he felt that if the Department of Justice in the Obama administration made the announcement it would lose credibility . The discovery of more emails in October might have changed that decision and represented an important development , he added .\nThe Trump-Russia counter-intelligence investigation , he argued , was highly classified and was in its “ very early stages ” by the time of the election .\nUK was given details of alleged contacts between Trump campaign and Moscow Read more\nHe confirmed that the inquiry was continuing , and agreed when asked whether it was “ fair to say that Russia is still involved in American politics ” . He went further , describing Russia as “ the greatest threat of any nation on earth , given their intention and their capability ” to US democracy .\nAsked about Comey ’ s claim that the Russian government is still involved in US politics , Spicer replied : “ I think that ’ s the view of the FBI . We rely on them and the rest of the intelligence community to provide the president with updates on what they ’ re learning . ”\nAt his hearing , Comey was peppered with questions about leaks about FBI investigations , and repeatedly stated he could neither confirm or deny .\nHe made one exception , however . Asked about contacts between FBI staff and Rudy Giuliani , a former New York mayor and current Trump aide , he said : “ I don ’ t know yet , but it ’ s a matter I ’ m very , very interested in . ”\nComey described in detail the process of discovering Clinton ’ s emails on the laptop of Anthony Weiner , the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin .\nHe said that “ somehow ” Clinton ’ s emails “ were being forwarded to Anthony Weiner , including classified information , by her assistant Huma Abedin ” .

    "222": "( CNN ) – Sen.

And it has politicians in both parties very uncomfortable , '' he said . `` And that new paradigm is the rise of the grass roots , the ability of grass-roots activists to demand of their elected officials they do the right thing . ''\nOpponents of Cruz 's effort say he 's risking a government shutdown in order to repeal Obama 's health law , and argue the president would never sign a measure defunding the signature legislation of his five years in office .\nBut Cruz casts the effort differently : Democrats , he said , would be the ones shutting the government down if they refuse to support a measure that funds all federal programs except Obamacare .\n`` President Obama , Harry Reid , will scream and holler that the mean , nasty Republicans are threatening to shut down the government . And at that point , Republicans have to do something we have n't done in a long time - stand up and win the argument , '' he said .\n`` We have voted to keep the government open , to fund the government , '' Cruz continued . `` Why is President Obama threatening to shut the government down to force Obamacare down the the throats of the American people ?

Gen Michael Flynn has promised “ full cooperation ” in the special counsel ’ s Russia investigation and , according to a confidant , is prepared to testify that Donald Trump directed him to make contact with the Russians , initially as a way to work together to fight ISIS in Syria .\nInterested in Russia Investigation ? Add Russia Investigation as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Russia Investigation news , video , and analysis from ███ . Add Interest\nThe stunning turn comes as Flynn pleaded guilty to one count of lying to the FBI about his back-channel negotiations with the Russian ambassador – talks that occurred before Trump took office . The special counsel made the plea agreement public Friday morning .\nThe confidant provided ███ with new details on Friday about Trump ’ s instructions to Flynn . During the campaign , Trump asked Flynn to be one of a small group of close advisors charged with improving relations in Russia and other hot spots . The source said Trump phoned Flynn shortly after the election to explicitly ask him to “ serve as point person on Russia , ” and to reach out personally to Russian officials to develop strategies to jointly combat ISIS .\nThe confidant told ███ that Flynn felt abandoned by Trump in recent weeks , and told friends about the decision to make the plea deal within the last 24 hours as he grew increasingly concerned about crippling legal costs he would face if he continued to contest the charges .\n“ Flynn is very angry , ” the confidant told ███ Friday . “ He will cooperate truthfully on any question they ask him . ”\nIn a prepared statement , Flynn expressed regret , but also stood defiant against the more scurrilous allegations that circulated about his work with Russia .\n“ It has been extraordinarily painful to endure these many months of false accusations of ‘ treason ’ and other outrageous acts , ” Flynn said in a statement . “ Such false accusations are contrary to everything I have ever done and stood for . But I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong , and , through my faith in God , I am working to set things right . ”\nRichard Frankel , a former senior aide to Flynn and an ███ contributor , said Flynn made his decision to cooperate under immense pressure , but he believes it is the right move for the country .\n“ I do n't know how much General Flynn knows about any criminal activity that took place during the campaign or in the White House , ” said Frankel , who also served in a senior role at the FBI . “ However , General Flynn was a top adviser to President Trump in the campaign and a top adviser to him when he entered into the WH so if there are bodies buried so to speak , General Flynn would know about them in my opinion . ”\nFlynn was charged with lying to the FBI about the nature of his conversations with then-Russian ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak during the presidential transition . Those conversations led Russian officials to temper their response to increased U.S. sanctions , according to the charging documents .\nThe charge carries a penalty of up to five years in prison , but according to court documents , Flynn likely faces a sentence of zero to six months .\nThe White House had claimed it was unaware of the substance of those conversations , but today ’ s court documents show Flynn was acting specifically at the direction of senior transition team officials .\nOn the same day President Obama imposed tough sanctions on Russian facilities in the U.S. for meddling in the election , the Russian ambassador called Flynn to talk about them . After that conversation , Flynn consulted with a senior transition team official who said the Trump “ did not want Russia to escalate the situation , ” so Flynn relayed the request directly to Kislyak .\nRussian officials tempered their response to increased U.S. sanctions , and President-elect Trump then tweeted : “ Great move on delay ( by V.Putin ) —I always knew he was very smart ! ”\nThe documents also show that “ a very senior member ” of the transition team , which ███ has learned was Trump ’ s son-in-law Jared Kushner , told Flynn to contact Russia about a United Nations resolution involving Israel .\nThe President has denied directing Flynn to make the contacts .\n“ No , I didn ’ t direct him , ” Trump said in February , “ but I would have directed him if he didn ’ t do it , okay ? ”\nFlynn became the latest and most-senior Trump associate to face charges in Mueller 's probe and arrived at the U.S. District courthouse accompanied by his wife and attorney Robert Kelner after having been processed at the FBI Washington Field Office , where he was fingerprinted and photographed , according to FBI officials .\nIn court , the retired lieutenant general was asked by Federal Judge Rudolph Contreras if he had ever been a part of similar proceedings , to which Flynn replied that he had not . Contreras then asked Kelner whether he was correct in assuming that Flynn was pleading guilty .\nAfter the hearing , Flynn was free to go , but has to check in with authorities each week . Sentencing has been put off for now — and the judge noted that Flynn is agreeing to cooperate with authorities in other matters .\nFlynn had initially resisted cooperating with the investigation , according to people close to the retired general , but he has been facing mounting legal debts and plans to sell his house to help defray costs .\nHe only recently learned the full scope of the charges he could potentially face . Last week , Trump lawyers received calls from Kelner , alerting them that he could no longer participate in information exchanges with other possible Mueller targets , the first public indication that a plea deal was in the works .\n“ My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel 's Office reflect a decision I made in the best interests of my family and of our country , ” Flynn said . “ I accept full responsibility for my actions . ”\nTrump and his legal team have learned of Flynn 's decision via news reports Friday morning , according to sources with knowledge of the situation .\nOn Monday , Kelner was spotted exiting a meeting at Mueller ’ s offices in Washington , ███ reported .\nFlynn is a decorated military officer who once headed the Defense Intelligence Agency and , after leaving government , spoke frequently at Trump campaign rallies . He began facing scrutiny after it was learned he took payment to attend a Russian television event , at which he appeared seated next to Russian President Vladimir Putin .\nThat scrutiny only increased after he took over as Trump ’ s national security adviser . He was ultimately forced to resign after just a few weeks on the job after it was revealed that he misled Vice President Mike Pence and other administration officials about his meeting with the Russian ambassador .\nFlynn initially denied that he discussed U.S. sanctions placed on Russia with Kislyak , but transcripts of Flynn and Kislyak ’ s phone calls reviewed by Justice Department lawyers showed otherwise .\nFlynn was paid over $ 500,000 by foreign clients for consulting work and speaking fees – including contracts he allegedly failed to list on applications for security clearances and financial disclosure forms . He also only belatedly disclosed lobbying work his firm engaged in on behalf of the Turkish government .\nTrump reportedly attempted to persuade the FBI to drop its investigation into Flynn ’ s conduct . In a Feb. 14 meeting at the White House , Trump reportedly told then-FBI Director James Comey to “ let this go . ”\n“ I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go , to letting Flynn go , ” Trump told Comey , according to a memo Comey wrote afterwards , which was later described by the New York Times . “ He is a good guy . I hope you can let this go . ”\nOn Oct. 30 , two members of Trump 's campaign staff , former campaign chair Paul Manafort and his longtime associate Rick Gates , were indicted on 12 counts brought by Mueller 's team related to work done prior to joining the Trump campaign , including conspiracy against the U.S. , conspiracy to launder money and serving as an unregistered agent of a foreign principal .\nThat same day , it was also revealed that a third Trump campaign adviser , George Papadopoulos , pleaded guilty earlier in the month to making false statements to FBI agents probing his attempts to arrange a meeting between Russian officials and the campaign .\nCorrection : During a live Special Report , ███ reported that a confidant of Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn said Flynn was prepared to testify that then-candidate Donald Trump instructed him to contact Russian officials during the campaign . That source later clarified that during the campaign , Trump assigned Flynn and a small circle of other senior advisers to find ways to repair relations with Russia and other hot spots . It was shortly after the election , that President-elect Trump directed Flynn to contact Russian officials on topics that included working jointly against ISIS . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "225": "( CNN ) - House Speaker John Boehner said Friday the budget President Barack Obama will soon unveil takes no steps towards finding common ground with Republicans , despite the president 's offer to cut federal entitlement spending .\n`` If the president believes these modest entitlement savings are needed to help shore up these programs , there 's no reason they should be held hostage for more tax hikes . That 's no way to lead and move the country forward , '' Boehner said in a press release .\nThe president 's proposal as described to CNN and other news outlets by senior Obama administration officials includes changes to Social Security and Medicare , similar to an offer Obama made to Boehner during the fiscal cliff negotiations in December . That would include a cut of $ 400 billion to Medicare over a decade .\n`` The president and I were not able to reach an agreement late last year because his offers never lived up to his rhetoric , '' Boehner responded . `` Despite talk about so-called balance , the president 's last offer was significantly skewed in favor of higher taxes and included only modest entitlement savings . He said he could go no further toward the middle , and that 's why his last offer was rejected . ''\nThe reported entitlement program changes have also received fire from left-leaning groups who argue the changes would hurt vulnerable individuals .\nObama 's budget also includes tax increases , which Republicans say is a non-starter since taxes were increased on wealthy individuals as part of the final fiscal cliff deal .\n`` In the end , the president got his tax hikes on the wealthy with no corresponding spending cuts , '' Boehner wrote . `` At some point we need to solve our spending problem , and what the president has offered would leave us with a budget that never balances . In reality , he 's moved in the wrong direction , routinely taking off the table entitlement reforms he 's previously told me he could support . ''\nHe suggested further that Obama 's so-called charm offensive was to little avail on budget matters .\n`` When the president visited the Capitol last month , House Republicans stated a desire to find common ground and urged him not to make savings we agree upon conditional on another round of tax increases . If reports are accurate , the president has not heeded that call , '' Boehner said .\nRepublicans have roundly criticized Obama for missing the February deadline for submitting his budget proposal . The proposal could be released next week , White House officials have said .\nThe Republican-led House has previously passed a proposal drafted by Budget Chairman Paul Ryan , R-Wisconsin .

    "226": "Agents who work for the FBI are reported to be devastated at President Donald Trump 's decision to fire FBI Director James Comey .\nPart of the problem , it seems , is with the way Trump dismissed Comey — namely , out of the blue and without so much as an opportunity to save face . As one source told The Los Angeles Times , Comey was `` caught flat-footed '' and only learned of his termination from a TV news report while speaking to FBI agents in Los Angeles .\nAs former FBI agent Lewis Schiliro told Politico , `` I think the way it was done was not real nice . He could have asked for his resignation and given him a little bit of time to bow out gracefully . '' Another senior official told the site that `` we were caught totally off guard . '' Yet another official told Politico that `` no one knew this was coming . Everyone is just shocked that this happened . ''\nAnother problem is that the timing of Comey 's firing raises questions about whether it was the result of the bureau 's ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign 's alleged relationship with Russia .\nAs one official told Politico , `` Everyone is asking , ‘ Why now ? What is the reason for doing it now ? ’ If this had happened immediately after the election , that would be one thing . Everyone was thinking it may happen then . But now ? People keep asking if it ’ s because of Russia . ''\nAnother agent said that `` the working agents don ’ t like the way the FBI has been portrayed over the last six or eight or 10 months . I think this will be very tough . It ’ s really going to require a non-politicized effort to ensure the current investigations are allowed to proceed without any interference . ''\nNone of this has stopped one of Trump 's greatest media boosters , Fox News host Sean Hannity , from praising the decision on the grounds that Comey was a `` national embarrassment '' for his handling of the Hillary Clinton email scandal . Hannity also tweeted on Wednesday that he believed many rank-and-file FBI agents were happy at the decision . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

''\nRomney made the candid `` 47 % '' remarks to a group of wealthy donors at a private fund-raiser caught on a secretly recorded video in May . The video was posted online by a left-leaning news organization earlier in September , sparking a firestorm of criticism from both sides of the aisle . Among other hotly contested remarks , the Republican nominee said nearly half of Americans will automatically vote for the president because they are dependent on government and consider themselves “ victims . ”\nRyan noted that Romney had conceded the lack of `` eloquence '' in his choice of words , though Ryan also picked up on the argument , blaming Obama for a sluggish economy and what the GOP campaign bills as policies that foster dependency on government .\nRyan also accused the media of having a liberal disposition .\n“ I think it kind of goes without saying that there 's definitely a media bias .

We expected media bias going into this , ” said Ryan .\nAsked to cite a specific example of media bias , Ryan demurred , instead asserting that most people who work in the media have liberal political affiliations and , therefore , would want a president who is a Democrat to win .\n“ I 'm not going to go into a tit-for-tat or litigate this thing , ” said Ryan . “ But as a conservative , I 've long believed and long felt that there is inherent media bias .

    "228": "Exclusive : Trump ’ s former press secretary describes Manafort as impactful and describes the president as ‘ a unicorn , riding a unicorn over a rainbow ’\nDreamily envisioning Donald Trump as “ a unicorn , riding a unicorn over a rainbow ” , former press secretary Sean Spicer has filled a new book with breathless memories of his role in recent American history – while admitting that Paul Manafort , suspected of being a tool of Moscow , played a central role in the Trump campaign .\nPaul Manafort says he 's being treated 'like a VIP ' in jail Read more\nIn The Briefing : Politics , the Press and the President , which will be released on 24 July and a copy of which was obtained by ███ , Spicer dramatically compares the work of a press secretary to that of fighter jet pilot , champion boxer and tightrope artist .\nAt impressive length , the book purports to set the record straight on an extensive string of micro-episodes and mini-scandals from the Trump campaign and early presidency .\nBut Spicer ’ s description in the book of Manafort ’ s campaign role belies Trump ’ s characterization of former campaign chairman Manafort as a minor campaign figure . Last year , Trump said Manafort had only been with the campaign for a “ very short period of time ” . The book also contradicts Spicer ’ s own March 2017 statement at the White House that Manafort had “ played a very limited role for a very limited amount of time ” .\nBut in the book Spicer portrays Manafort as having an important and impactful role .\n“ Paul brought a much-needed maturity to the Trump campaign when it needed an experienced political professional operative more than anything else , ” Spicer writes of Manafort ’ s hiring in the spring of 2016 . “ There was no semblance of a campaign structure , just a few , distraught , overworked people constantly barking into their phones . Paul immediately set up and staffed the political and communications operations necessary to take on the Clinton machine .\n“ The Manafort message was clear : Trump will be our nominee and our next president , and anyone who didn ’ t want to work to that end could spend the next four years in political Siberia . ( No Russia pun intended . ) ”\nManafort resigned as Trump campaign chairman in August 2016 , after the national spotlight focused on undeclared payments that he had received for work in the former Soviet bloc . He was jailed last month as he awaits trial on charges of money laundering , tax fraud , failure to register as a foreign agent and obstruction of justice . Manafort has denied all wrongdoing .\nElsewhere in the book , the reader finds out what really was happening behind the scenes when Spicer , now an unpaid Fox News guest with a podcast and an Instagram , attacked the press for pointing out the small size of Trump ’ s inauguration day crowd ; when Spicer first saw Melissa McCarthy ’ s impression of him on Saturday Night Live ; when Spicer denied that Adolf Hitler used chemical weapons ; when Anthony Scaramucci was appointed as Spicer ’ s boss ; when Spicer was excluded from a papal audience ; when Spicer allegedly hid in the White House bushes on the night of James Comey ’ s firing ( didn ’ t happen , Spicer says ) ; and when Trump ’ s Access Hollywood “ Grab ’ em by the pussy ” tape emerged .\n“ I was surprised by how many women who contacted me did not consider Trump ’ s comments a big deal , ” Spicer writes of the latter episode . “ One prominent Republican woman told me , ‘ You all talk like this ; we know it. ’ ( Actually , we men don ’ t all talk like this , but I held my tongue . ) ”\nSpicer , whose six-month stint as White House press secretary lasted only one month longer than Manafort ’ s job with the Trump campaign , loads his memoir with painstakingly thorough descriptions of his own intensively incremental career calculations .\n“ I had talked to White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and chief strategist Steve Bannon about me stepping away from the podium and taking a more strategic role , ” Spicer writes at one stage , “ which I thought better suited my talents . ”\nBut Spicer ’ s admiration for Trump shines through all of his reflections on the frustrations of the job . While Spicer in one passage applies the words “ erratic ” and “ mercurial ” to the president , the book – which begins with a scene of Trump determinedly refusing Spicer ’ s resignation – is filled with emotionally charged passages starring the president . ( The book also includes an eloquent passage in which Spicer writes about the tragic loss of his father to cancer during the presidential transition . )\nAfter what he judged to be a particularly strong early outing as press secretary , Spicer rushes back to where Trump has been watching on television .\n“ To my eternal surprise , he rose up and gave me a bear hug , ” Spicer writes . “ ‘ That ’ s my Sean . Good job , ’ he said . ‘ Right way to do it ’ . ”\nDonald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) A friend of mine and a man who has truly seen politics and life as few others ever will , Sean Spicer , has written a great new book , “ The Briefing : Politics , the Press and the President. ” It is a story told with both heart and knowledge . Really good , go get it !\nSpicer proudly recounts the story of lending the president a green tie for a meeting with the Irish taoiseach – and not getting the tie back . He lards on the praise for the president ’ s political skills .\n“ I don ’ t think we will ever again see a candidate like Donald Trump , ” Spicer writes . “ His high-wire act is one that few could ever follow . He is a unicorn , riding a unicorn over a rainbow . His verbal bluntness involves risks that few candidates would dare take . His ability to pivot from a seemingly career-ending moment to a furious assault on his opponents is a talent few politicians can muster . ”\nBut an early episode in Spicer ’ s time as press secretary almost ruined his relationship with Trump . On the day after the inauguration , Trump , who had been watching TV coverage of his small inauguration crowd size , called up Spicer , who writes :\n‘ Sean , have you seen the news ? ’ The president was clear : this needed to be addressed – now ... I assumed that was the approach the president would want to see again : strong , aggressive , no questions . I was wrong . ”\nIn a hastily convened press briefing , Spicer attacked the media as biased and dismissed photographs that showed Barack Obama ’ s inauguration crowd as having been much bigger than Trump ’ s .\n“ This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration – period – both in person and around the globe , ” Spicer insisted at the time – and in his book , he refuses to back down from the assertion , claiming there was some enormous international online streaming audience .\nBut his audience of one thought Spicer had botched it , he writes :\nI went back to my office , expecting an ‘ attaboy ’ from the president ; instead Reince was waiting for me and said the president wasn ’ t happy at all with how I had performed . He didn ’ t like my not taking questions . He thought I was hung up on the wrong issues . He wanted to know why I hadn ’ t run my statement by him . Minutes later , the president himself called , and he was not pleased . And I started to wonder if my first day would be my last ... I had made a bad first impression , and looking back , that was the beginning of the end .\nThe moment spawned what may be the most indelible popular image of Spicer , the impression of him on Saturday Night Live as a pugnacious , mendacious pulverizer of chewing gum .\nThe biggest Trump resignations and firings so far Read more\n“ Taking a deep breath , I went to the DVR and saw Melissa McCarthy wearing my suit , downing gum by the bucket ( guilty as charged , but never at the lectern ) , and yelling at the media , ” Spicer writes of watching the skit . “ I had no choice but to laugh . ”\nSpicer handed in his resignation after the flamboyant former Wall Streeter Scaramucci , whose personality Spicer describes as “ pungent ” , was hired as communications director .\nLest any reader come away with the impression of Spicer as a prisoner to his affection for the president , or as clinging too eagerly to scraps of a frankly fairly brief past , he closes his book with a declaration of independence .\n“ I spent my career in service to powerful people , always in a supporting role to someone else who played the part of the principal – a member of Congress , an RNC chairman , a president of the United States , ” writes Spicer .\n“ Now I was my own principal . Now , at last , I was free to be my own man . ” \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "229": "One particular constellation of white supremacist assumptions — centered on , though not limited to the state-sanctioned display of the Confederate battle flag — has suddenly fallen into question . So now , in order to preserve the broader framework — in which , for example , that symbol of white supremacy can be proudly preserved for private and non-state public display — a slight reorientation is in order , and was recently articulated by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley .\nGiven how sharply Haley broke with her previous position , and the temporizing of others around her , I do not wish to sound ungrateful or unappreciative of what she has done . There is still fierce opposition in some nearby quarters to what she has done , and she showed some degree of moral leadership when she called for state law to be quickly changed , so that the battle flag could be taken down . Yet , it ’ s equally clear that she has framed her argument well within the historical tradition of Southern white supremacist ideology — not in the heart of that tradition , to be sure , but still within the stifling folds of its garments .\nFor many people in our state the flag stands for traditions that are noble — traditions of history , of heritage , and of ancestry . The hate-filled murderer who massacred our brothers and sisters in Charleston has a sick and twisted view of the flag . In no way does he reflect the people in our state who respect and in many ways revere it . Those South Carolinians view the flag as a symbol of respect , integrity and duty . They also see it as a memorial , a way to honor ancestors who came to the service of their state during time of conflict . That is not hate . Nor is it racism .\nIn short , Dylann Roof messed things up for all the rest of us , so — unfortunately — things have to change . Implicitly , that ’ s the real bottom line . Haley continued , with a brief nod to the obvious , before hurrying on :\nAt the same time , for many others in South Carolina , the flag is a deeply offensive symbol of a brutally oppressive past . As a state , we can survive and indeed we can thrive as we have done whilst still being home to both of those viewpoints . We do not need to declare a winner and a loser here .\nAnd so she declared a truce — the truce of false equivalency — as the pathway forward :\nWe respect freedom of expression . And that for those who wish to show their respect for the flag on their private property , no one will stand in your way . But the statehouse is different . And the events of this past week call upon us to look at this in a different way .\nThe willingness to change is easy to grab onto and praise , but the more troubling aspects , the multiple ways in which change — not to mention simple justice — are more challenging to properly grasp , identify and name , much less come to terms with . At least three starting points can easily be identified , however . The first came from Ta-Nehisi Coates . Honing in on the underlying claim that Roof 's views did not reflect those of South Carolinians more broadly , Coates quickly weighed in to say :\nIf the governor meant that very few of the flag ’ s supporters believe in mass murder , she is surely right . But on the question of whose view of the Confederate Flag is more twisted , she is almost certainly wrong . Roof ’ s belief that black life had no purpose beyond subjugation is “ sick and twisted ” in the exact same manner as the beliefs of those who created the Confederate flag were “ sick and twisted. ” The Confederate flag is directly tied to the Confederate cause , and the Confederate cause was white supremacy .\nThis is the plain historical reality , and Coates goes on to rolls out stanza after stanza in an impressive historical litany of authoritative voices repeatedly underscoring the point , beginning with the Confederate states ’ own explanations for war , starting with South Carolina , then Mississippi ( which was particularly blunt : “ Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery — the greatest material interest of the world. ” ) , Louisiana , Alabama ( “ the election of Mr. Lincoln can not be regarded otherwise than … an open declaration of war ” ) and Texas .\nHe then goes on to quote notable individuals , such as Jefferson Davis , not only affirming the centrality of slavery to the Southern cause , but elaborating on their desire to extend slaveholding into Cuba , Mexico and elsewhere , as well as propounding their belief that the equality of white men was founded on the slavery of blacks , and thus would be irrevocably lost if slavery were to be abolished . Thus , white supremacy for the South was not simply an isolated belief in the inherent superiority of whites as a race , it was the foundation for an aggressive and self-styled “ progressive ” worldview , a whole self-contained system of thought . The flag is inextricably linked to all of that .\nAs a second starting point it ’ s also true that the Confederate battle flag was largely a relic until it was revived in response to the Civil Rights Movement — first with Strom Thurmond ’ s “ States Rights Party ” in 1948 , then with Georgia adopting a version in protest of Brown v. Board of Education in 1956 , and South Carolina six years later — though , tellingly , the flag went up a year before the act authorizing it . For almost a hundred years , the South got on just fine celebrating its heritage without benefit of the flag . Indeed , the flag was raised over South Carolina as a result of the Civil War centennial celebration . This revival of interest in the flag was clearly all about renewed defiance of the federal government , which was finally being prodded into making good on the Civil War Amendments , and ensuring the full citizenship of African-Americans . Hence , today , the “ heritage ” the flag actually stands for is that of the 1960s , not the 1860s . Good luck with that .\nA third , related point , made by Jeet Heer at the New Republic , is that the flag matters tremendously as exertion of raw power . Its reintroduction in response to the Civil Rights movement sent a clear message : “ The feds might try to help you , but remember who is the boss down here . We still rule. ” Flying everywhere throughout the South , it sends the constant message to black Southerners , that they are not safe , they are not in control of their own personal security , much less anything else . Whatever other stories Southern whites might tell themselves and others about the flag , this basic fact remains . Indeed , the rhetorical act of denying the flag ’ s white supremacist meaning only demonstrates further how completely whites control things .\nBeyond these three starting points , there ’ s a vast terrain to explore , in terms of the white supremacist legacy the flag stands for and how it has reshaped itself over time . There are at least four key elements that any such account would have to explore . First , is the matter of white supremacy itself as a matter of organized social policy — both in terms of what it supports ( slavery in one era , segregation in the next , etc . ) and what it opposes ( abolition , integration , “ big government ” ) — as well as the culture it both depends upon and reproduces . Second , is the way in which white supremacy reorganizes itself from one historical regime to another , both establishing purportedly new foundations , while simultaneously reinterpreting the past .\nIt originally expressed itself in terms of slavery , then segregation and now largely in terms of what sociologist Eduardo Bonilla-Silva described as “ colorblind racism ” in his book `` Racism Without Racists : Color-Blind Racism and the Persistence of Racial Inequality in America . '' Third , is the way in which white supremacy naturalizes , normalizes and moralizes itself , so as to render itself difficult to clearly identify , much less name , and fight against . Bonilla-Silva ’ s book has a great deal to say about this as well . Furthermore , the pretense that the battle flag represents Civil War-era heritage rather than Civil Rights-era hatred is a telling example of how this process unfolds . Fourth , is the way in which white supremacy usurps otherwise noble ideals , such bringing people together , establishing peace and harmony , promoting tolerance , etc . Haley leaned very heavily on this aspect of white supremacy in the process of pretending to reject it . So let us briefly consider each of these in turn .\nFirst , let ’ s reflect on white supremacy as a matter of organized social policy . There is nothing particularly difficult for people today to look back on past forms of white supremacy and reject them . It ’ s easy nowadays to see slavery or segregation as evil . Even Rand Paul , defending segregation in principle , said it was a bad business decision . But what about white supremacy policies today ?\nWhile part of the impetus to remove the Confederate battle flag in South Carolina came from respect for the Rev . Clementa Pinckney , the long-serving , highly respected member of the South Carolina State Senate , this only scratched the surface of Pinckney ’ s politics , as pointed out by North Carolina NAACP leader the Rev . William Barber on Democracy Now ! recently :\nReverend Pinckney , as a colleague in ministry , was not just opposed to the flag , he was opposed to the denial of Medicaid expansion , where now the majority of the state is opposing Medicaid expansion where six out of 10 black people live . He was opposed to voter suppression , voter ID in South Carolina . He was opposed to those who have celebrated the ending of the Voting Rights Act , or the gutting of Section 4 , which means South Carolina is no longer a preclearance state , and the very district that he served in is vulnerable right now . He was opposed to the lack of funding for public education . He wanted to see living wages raised .\nEvery item Barber mentioned is felt more deeply by the black community , so it ’ s not hard to grasp what a true rejection of white supremacy would look like . One might say that this calls for “ activist government , ” but the white South was all in favor of activist government `` When Affirmative Action Was White , '' as Ira Katznelson ’ s 2006 book explained . Thus , Barber continued :\nSo I would say to my colleagues , let ’ s take down the flag — to the governor — but also , let ’ s put together an omnibus bill in the name of the nine martyrs . And all of the things Reverend Pinckney was standing for , if we say we love him and his colleagues , let ’ s put all of those things in a one big omnibus bill and pass that and bring it to the funeral on Friday or Saturday , saying we will expand Medicaid to help not only black people , but poor white Southerners in South Carolina , because it ’ s not just the flag . Lee Atwater talked about the Southern strategy , where policy was used as a way to divide us . And if we want harmony , we have to talk about racism , not just in terms of symbol , but in the substance of policies . The flag went up to fight policies . If we ’ re going to bring it down , we ’ re also going to have to change policies , and particularly policies that create disparate impact on black , brown and poor white people .\nThe phrase “ disparate impact , ” which Barber used , is key to how white supremacy operates in the post-segregation era . It ’ s not that the races are treated entirely differently , only that the odds , burdens , privileges and benefits change , depending on the color of your skin . Often this happens without any conscious awareness , which is why Bonilla-Silva ’ s phrase , “ racism without racists ” is so apt . This is really not difficult to grasp — unless you ’ ve got a vested interest in not grasping it . In which case , welcome to the world of our second topic , the way in which white supremacy reorganizes itself from one historical regime to the next , and how\nTransitions between eras are often abrupt in some respects — the swift abolition of slavery in the final years of the Civil War , for example — while taking decades to work out in other ways . In order to first establish , and then fully stabilize the segregationist era , the meaning and purpose of the Civil War itself had to be reinterpreted through a white supremacist lens . The story of how that transpired over a fifty-year period is the subject of `` Race and Reunion : The Civil War in American Memory '' by David W. Blight . As I summarized in my review :\nBlight explains three broad visions of Civil War memory - reconciliationist , emancipationist and white supremacist . The first was born in wartime responses to its terrible brutality , epitomized by Walt Whitman 's experience of tending the wounded and dying of both sides . The second sprang not just from the war , but also from the Emancipation Proclamation and the more than 200,000 black combatants who joined the fight . The third gradually reformulated itself after the shock of military defeat , eventually dominating reconciliationist thinking by sacrificing racial reconciliation for the sake of sectional reunion .\nIt was not surprising that the reconciliationist view came to dominate — politically , materially , the nation needed sectional reintegration in a much more immediate way than it needed anything for its black citizens — a calculus that would eventually change over time . What ’ s striking is the relative ease with which the white supremacist vision came to merge with and dominate the reconciliationist view .\nThis is not the exception , but the rule in American history : any moves toward reconciling differences inevitably become infected with white supremacist aims — unless , of course , they are founded on them to begin with , as the case with American Colonization Society and the movement surrounding it , more on that below . A similar process has taken place with the end of segregation and the discrediting of overt racism which the norm in that era throughout the South , as well as in much of the North . This is essence of what Bonilla-Silva reveals in `` Racism Without Racists '' : a set of beliefs has emerged with superficially broad appeal , but which harbors a “ hidden ” white supremacist impact . Bonilla-Silva identifies four central frames at the core of colorblind racism : `` The central component of any dominant racial ideology is its frames or set paths for interpreting information , '' Bonilla-Silva writes . The first — and what I take to be the most significant and distinctive frame — is “ abstract liberalism , ” which he explains as follows :\nThe frame of abstract liberalism involves using ideas associated with political liberalism ( e.g . `` equal opportunity , '' the idea that force should not be used to achieve social policy ) and economic liberalism ( e.g. , choice , individualism ) in an abstract manner to explain racial matters .\nWhat abstract liberalism hides is virtually everything having to do with history and indeed all social science , outside the narrow framework of market economics . It hides all historical inequalities , which recent research suggests persists for as long as ten generations . It also hides subconscious racial preferences , which can create intense segregation without any overt centralized coercion . But above all , it creates the illusion of some idealized social order , which blacks objecting to can be portrayed as opposing in favor of racial preferences — aka “ reverse racism. ” In short , the moral burden of racism past can be shifted onto them : they are the “ real racists , ” not whites !\nThe three other frames Bonilla-Silva identifies also play significant roles , but I would argue they are less specifically tied to this era alone . These are “ naturalization , ” which “ allows whites to explain away racial phenomena by suggesting they are natural occurrences , ” “ cultural racism ” which “ relies on culturally based arguments such as ‘ Mexicans do not put much emphasis on education ’ or ‘ blacks have too many babies ’ to explain the standing of minorities in society ” and “ minimization of racism ” which “ suggests discrimination is no longer a central factor affecting minorities ' life chances ( ‘ It 's better now than in the past ’ or ‘ There is discrimination , but there are plenty of jobs out there ’ ) . ” All three of these frames have been used in past eras . For example , Booker T. Washington was a celebrated black figure precisely because he argued so powerfully that things were better than in the past , so segregation was something blacks could and should accept . Similarly , cultural racism was always part of the package in older forms of racism . But I believe Bonilla-Silva is essentially correct in identifying these a surviving frameworks as playing central roles in how racism functions in America today .\nAs I indicated above , not only does Bonilla-Silva ’ s concept of colorblind racism illuminate how white supremacy has transitioned from one formulation to another , it also shows how this new form of white supremacy “ naturalizes , normalizes and moralizes itself , so as to render itself difficult to clearly identify , much less name , and fight against. ” Indeed , this is the very essence of how one framework of white supremacy comes to replace another — a new framework of “ common sense ” emerges , responding to multiple different needs at once , most typically , a need to reject and distance society from older practices that have become indefensible , and a contrary need to retain as much of the underlying power relations as possible . The rejection of the old order may can even serve to infuse the new order with a presumption of moral rectitude , even as it maintains many of the features of the old order virtually intact . Meanwhile , those who might object can be cast as moral outsiders — even holdovers of the old order , even if they are among its most profound and strenuous critics .\nThis leads us directly to our fourth topic , the way in which white supremacy usurps otherwise noble ideals , such bringing people together , establishing peace and harmony , promoting tolerance and so forth . It is the very nature of social power that those with the most of it can use their power to define social reality for everybody else , and this is what white supremacist ideology has repeatedly done . Not only does white supremacy lay down the law , if conflicts arise in response , white supremacy takes the lead in naming , identifying and analyzing them , leading to proposed white supremacist solutions . On a macro scale , this is how one form of white supremacist society comes to be replaced by another — but it applies on every scale , from the lowliest parts on up to the whole .\nOne significant example of this can be found in the history of the American Colonization Society . It was originally founded to bring together two politically disparate groups , Northern abolitionists and Southern slaveholders , both united by the belief that free blacks faced a miserable future in America , and would be better off in Africa . This granddaddy of all “ grand bargains ” was laughable on its face — there hundreds of thousands of free blacks , far more than could ever be returned to Africa , even if they had all wanted to go — which most emphatically did not . But it was extremely popular with political elites , precisely because of its centrist power to “ bring people together ” — white people , that is . In his book , `` Of One Blood : Abolitionism and the Origins of Racial Equality , '' historian Paul Goodman had this to say :\nBy 1817 , African colonization had become more than a speculative idea . In the next decade , hundreds of prominent Americans -- political leaders including Presidents Madison and Monroe and religious leaders in most of the large denominations , from Presbyterian Lyman Beecher of Massachusetts to Episcopalian bishop William Mead of Virginia—threw their prestige and influence behind the America Colonization Society ( ACS ) , which established the colony of Liberia in West Africa . One of the most impressive voluntary societies of its day , the ACS boasted over two hundred state and local auxiliaries by 1830 . It was quietly assisted by President Monroe and endorsed by state legislatures and the major religious denominations , as well as by an illustrious panoply of notables .\nAs Goodman goes on to describe , the 19th-Century abolitionist movement was born out of free blacks ’ opposition to the ACS . It was precisely their unwillingness to be “ reasonable ” which formed the foundation of resistance which eventually spread to white abolitionists , and over a period five decades , eventually resulted in emancipation . Yet , almost up until Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation he himself continued to be a supporter of colonization — such was the power of this “ centrist ” white supremacist vision . In fact , the ACS lived on for almost 100 years after Lincoln ’ s death — it only shut down in 1964 !\nThere are many other instances in which the cause of black freedom only advanced by refusing to be “ reasonable ” or to live up to some purported virtue or another . That ’ s because white supremacy , in one form or another , has always had such an enormous say in dictating what it meant to be “ reasonable ” or virtuous . And so it ’ s been incumbent on blacks to learn to think outside the box — to find a broader framework of understanding on which to found their moral as well as their political analysis .\nThis is why Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. , once spoke to the American Psychological Association , and came out proudly for the cause of what he called “ creative maladjustment ” :\nI am sure that we will recognize that there are some things in our society , some things in our world , to which we should never be adjusted . There are some things concerning which we must always be maladjusted if we are to be people of good will . We must never adjust ourselves to racial discrimination and racial segregation . We must never adjust ourselves to religious bigotry . We must never adjust ourselves to economic conditions that take necessities from the many to give luxuries to the few . We must never adjust ourselves to the madness of militarism , and the self-defeating effects of physical violence… . Thus , it may well be that our world is in dire need of a new organization , The International Association for the Advancement of Creative Maladjustment .\nSimilarly , King ’ s “ Letter From Birmingham Jail ” was all about rejecting the framework of passive , superficial words of peace , moderation and restraint which the white ministers of Birmingham sought to impose on him . Here is just a small section of the wisdom it contains :\nI had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress . I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious negative peace , in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust plight , to a substantive and positive peace , in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human personality . Actually , we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension . We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive . We bring it out in the open , where it can be seen and dealt with .\nI could not help myself thinking about the profound wrong-headed of “ reasonable ” white supremacy as I heard Nikki Haley ’ s speech , which is why my enthusiasm for it was so dimmed . In perhaps her most deeply typical move , she said there didn ’ t have to be winners and losers . Folks who love the flag and folks who despise it can all get along just fine ! But , of course , that leaves the entire substantive agenda Reverend Barber spoke about dead on arrival — just as it was supposed to do . There is no real underlying intent to address and disown the evil of white supremacy . The only way that evil is faced is by projecting it onto the disowned Confederate son , Dylann Roof .\nA good way to understand what ’ s wrong with Haley ’ s speech is to compare it with a speech by a quintessential white Southerner , Strom Thurmond ’ s son , whose speech makes no such attempt to defend the blind worship of “ heritage. ” Here is what South Carolina State Senator Paul Thurmond said :\nI am aware of my heritage . But my appreciation for the things that my forebearers accomplished to make my life better doesn ’ t mean that I must believe that they always made the right decisions and , for the life of me , I will never understand how anyone could fight a civil war based , in part , on the desire to continue the practice of slavery . Think about it for just a second . Our ancestors were literally fighting to continue to keep human beings as slaves and continue the unimaginable acts that occur when someone is held against their will . I am not proud of this heritage . These practices were inhumane and were wrong , wrong , wrong .\nWhere Haley felt the need to comfort — even identify with — those who see the flag as a symbol of noble heritage , Paul Thurmond simply said , “ I am not proud. ” Simple as that . A clean break . And that , my friends , is what America needs , where white supremacy is concerned . A clean break — and then the real business of a creating a livable future for all of us can begin . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "230": "There was a predictable conventional wisdom heading into Wednesday 's post-election press conference that President Obama would need to announce some sort of vaguely defined course correction , or at least show contrition . That he would need to develop a list of center-right policy proposals to discuss with Mitch McConnell over some sort of ice-breaking lunch . That he would have to abandon the partisan posture that allegedly hung his party out to dry on Tuesday night .\nWhat a shocking development it must have been , then , to see the president not completely change his set of beliefs and priorities overnight after his party fared poorly in a midterm election .\nHe reiterated his intention to take whatever executive action on immigration he legally can by the end of the year while also encouraging Congress to deliver a comprehensive immigration reform bill that he knows will never come . He said he will veto the bills he believes are bad ideas , such as a repeal of the Affordable Care Act or of its most crucial components . He will be open to working on the right-of-center policy positions that he 's always been annoyingly open to : trade deals and corporate tax reform . He still wants to fix bridges and roads and increase the minimum wage . The only major policy that he seemed to introduce -- and it 's an important one -- was in welcoming an Authorization for Use of Military Force ( AUMF ) to define the war against ISIS .\nHe 's basically the same guy he was the day before the election , and that 's going to send many in Washington to their fainting couches . Why ca n't he abandon his plans for executive action on immigration ? Why wo n't he fire someone ? Why wo n't he agree to sign everything the Republicans send him ? Does n't he realize he has to change if he wants to accomplish things with Republicans ?\nLest we forget , though , he 's been through this once before , after the 2010 elections . And he appears to have learned the right lessons from that : No changes in his behavior are going to cause a rapprochement with Republicans .\nRemember the big , sad show he put on after 2010 , the last time he was pressured into changing his ways overnight ? It makes you wince . Hiring Bill Daley , a person who had no idea what he was doing , to serve as chief of staff in order to curry favor with the `` business community . '' Signing a two-year extension of the top-bracket Bush tax cuts . Allowing Republicans to trick him into negotiating over a raise in the debt ceiling . Trying countless times to pursue a `` grand bargain '' deficit deal on taxes and social insurance programs .\nWhat he got in return for these efforts was nothing . ( And thank God , by the way , that he did n't get a grand bargain . ) The Republican Party refused to negotiate with him , because the current Republican Party 's identity is forged on being oppositional to Barack Obama . If it were to agree with him on some significant piece of legislation , then that would make Barack Obama something less-than-Satan , which would make the Republican Party ... what ?\nLet 's do a thought experiment . Say Barack Obama dropped his plan to take executive action on immigration in order to foster cooperation with Republicans on passing comprehensive immigration reform . What would happen ? He 'd be denounced by a significant portion of the Democratic base , perhaps irreparably . And then the Republican leaders in the House and Senate would proceed to do exactly nothing on immigration , because it 's not in their members ' interests to cut a comprehensive immigration reform deal with Barack Obama . And then Obama , because he is the president , would get the blame for nothing `` getting done '' in Washington . What possible reason is there for him to delay executive action on immigration ? He can either improve the lives of millions of people , excite the members of his party , and have Republicans hate him or improve the lives of no one , depress the members of his party , and have Republicans hate him .\nOtherwise , it 's not exactly clear what he could do for a `` fresh start . '' The closest and therefore most lazily applied reference is to President George W. Bush 's response to his party 's 2006 midterm loss , when he fired Donald Rumsfeld . Obama could fire someone , but whom ? There is no equivalent to a Rumsfeld in this administration . Bush lost that election because of the Iraq War , and Rumsfeld was the surly household name running the Iraq War . There is no analogous figurehead in the Obama administration waiting to be lopped off . And it 's not like Rumsfeld 's firing ceased the Bush administration 's prosecution of the war , anyway . One of the first things Bush did with his new Democratic Congress was ask for ( and receive ) funding to deploy tens of thousands of additional troops to Iraq .\nIf Obama seemed unusually calm in his press conference Wednesday , it 's because he felt no pressure to present himself as something other than the center-left technocrat that he is . He learned after 2010 that it does n't matter whether he presents himself as a center-left technocrat , a center-right technocrat , a budget hawk , John Boehner 's golf buddy or whatever : Those who are intent on seeing him as a radical leftist hell-bent on America 's destruction will see him as a radical leftist hell-bent on America 's destruction , because that 's the narrative that works for them .\nBut sure , if Mitch McConnell wants to have a drink , they can have a drink . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

There were no deletions . There is no attempt to hide , ” Donald Trump ’ s daughter told ABC News in an interview aired on Wednesday morning .\nTrump insists daughter Ivanka 's private email use for work was 'very innocent ' Read more\nIvanka Trump reportedly used her personal account up to 100 times in 2017 to contact other Trump administration officials . The news drew immediate comparisons with Hillary Clinton ’ s use of a private server as secretary of state , which still prompts Donald Trump ’ s supporters to chant “ lock her up ” at rallies . The president apparently wanted Clinton prosecuted after he took the White House .\nBut on Wednesday Ivanka Trump insisted there was no comparison between the two cases .\n“ In my case , all of my emails are on the White House server . There ’ s no intent to circumvent , ” she told ABC . “ There ’ s no equivalency to what my father ’ s spoken about . ”\nOn the Clinton case , Ivanka Trump said : “ There were mass deletions after a subpoena was issued . My emails have not been deleted . Nor was there anything of substance , nothing confidential that was within them . So there ’ s no connection between the two things . ”\nRepublicans and Democrats in Congress have requested information from the White House to determine whether the first daughter complied with federal record keeping laws .

    "236": "Duane Miller realized at the “ very last minute ” last November that he was going to vote for a candidate he didn ’ t much like , Donald Trump . He did not even really vote for Trump , to hear him describe it .\nInstead , he voted against Washington fecklessness and corruption , which he saw as embodied by Hillary Clinton , in his eyes the ultimate establishment candidate , who was doubtlessly going to win anyway , he thought .\nTrump 's big test : will his swing voters stay loyal ? Read more\n“ I thought there was no way that Trump could beat Hillary , right up till the end , ” said Miller . “ Right up to the night before . ”\nThat was almost a year ago , now . Enough time for the surprise of Trump ’ s victory to sink in . Enough time to get a look at Trump in the White House , and to assess his performance as president .\nMiller , 79 , a Democrat and the former mayor of Bangor , Pennsylvania , has not been impressed by Trump – but it would be inaccurate to say that Miller is surprised , either , because , as he puts it , he never mistook Trump for a political savior . It is a view shared by many of the customers at his paint store , he said .\n“ Trump ’ s losing support because of his , of the complete stupidity – you know , maybe we should give him an IQ test with others , ” Miller said , referring to Trump ’ s recent challenge to secretary of state Rex Tillerson to compare IQ tests . “ People are getting fed up with that . But there ’ s not much of an alternative . We ’ ll elect someone in four years . So .\nConversations with Trump voters as the anniversary of the 8 November election nears do not typically reveal such regret . Most people who voted for the president are still solidly behind him , at least in Northampton County , Pennsylvania , which voted for Barack Obama twice before opting for Trump last fall .\nFor our series The Promise , ███ has been interviewing Trump supporters in Northampton since before the inauguration , to gauge whether support for the president in this key bellwether county is changing , and to find out whether Trump voters feel that the president has delivered on his promise to Make America Great Again .\nTrump ’ s core supporters in the region are still with him , although the president appears to have slipped with impulsive or protest voters like Miller , said Christopher Borick , director of the Institute of Public Opinion at Muhlenberg College in neighboring Lehigh County .\n“ There ’ s a difference , right ? ” said Borick . “ There ’ s the Trump voter , and there are people who voted for Trump last year . And Trump voters are still every bit as passionate , or even more so , than they were last year in Northampton County . Those folks are going nowhere .\n“ But there are those folks that made the call last fall – because they didn ’ t like Clinton , or they just wanted to blow things up – now a year in , that aren ’ t enamored any more . They kind of have a bit of buyer ’ s remorse . ”\nAre there enough of those “ buyer ’ s remorse ” people to reverse the presidential result and hand Trump a defeat in Northampton , if the election were held again tomorrow ?\n“ I think it would be a very close race , ” said Borick .\nIn 2012 , Obama beat Romney by 6,160 votes in the former steel industry heartland of Northampton County as he comfortably held on to the state of Pennsylvania . Last year , Clinton nearly matched Obama ’ s performance in Northampton , but she lost the county by 5,461 votes as Trump won some Democrats and saw a surge in first-time and dormant voter turnout on his way to narrowly winning the state by 0.7 % of the votes cast .\nIt ’ s too early to judge the battle lines for future elections . But it ’ s clear that the sense of disillusionment that created an opening for Trump in places like Northampton did not go away , and may only have deepened , with his victory .\nJeff Fox , 57 , of Pen Argyl , Pennsylvania , said he reluctantly voted for Trump “ given the situation ” . But Fox lamented the “ lack of civility ” in politics , frustration with which drove him to switch his party registration from Republican to Independent before last year ’ s election .\n“ I have very rarely heard the real reason I think that Donald Trump won , ” said Fox .\nFor many people who follow US politics from the coasts or overseas , Trump ’ s presidency can seem like a string of endless scandals . Trump personally promises $ 25,000 to the father of a fallen soldier which he then fails to deliver until it becomes a news story . Trump blasts football players for kneeling during the national anthem and calls press freedom “ frankly disgusting ” . Trump responds to a white supremacist march in Charlottesville , Virginia , by saying “ both sides ” were responsible for ensuing violence . The list goes on .\nBut viewed from the other end of the telescope , the list isn ’ t a parade of offenses . It ’ s a list of examples of how Trump ’ s words or his intentions are repeatedly twisted by the media , which seem to regard the president as an enemy . It ’ s also a list of examples of how Trump is in touch with the pulse of Main Street , USA .\n“ With the national anthem , that ’ s a really big thing among the little people , ” said Joe D ’ Ambrosio , a barber in Bethlehem , Pennsylvania , who switched his party registration from Democrat to Republican so he could vote for Trump in the state ’ s closed primary .\nD ’ Ambrosio said there was “ no question ” that the president was on the right side of the debate over National Football League players kneeling during the national anthem , which players have explained is a protest of police violence against African Americans but which Trump has framed , successfully it appears , as an attack on patriotism .\n“ What these guys ought to do is start looking at the History Channel and watch how many people died in our wars , and see what kind of contribution they made in the military , ” D ’ Ambrosio said . “ All they ’ re worried about is their millions . ”\nTrump ’ s response to the violence in Charlottesville had been similarly misinterpreted , many voters in Northampton told ███ .\n“ He isn ’ t the best public speaker , ” said Fox . “ And that ’ s Trump . That ’ s who he is . But I think to take what he said and twist it into , you know , ‘ He supports racists and white supremacists ’ – I mean , c ’ mon . No . Taking little soundbites – no . Not if you look at the whole picture .\n“ What I ’ m saying is that there are people that stir the pot and contribute to a lack of civility in discourse , that are blind to the fact that they themselves contribute to the lack of civil discourse , and blame it all on Trump , for example . ”\nFor 10 weeks every year , from mid-October through Christmas , the city of Bethlehem suspends an ordinance prohibiting the placement of debris in the street to allow for leaf clearance . Residents rake leaves off their lawns and into neat piles in the gutters , where eventually they are vacuumed up ( at some volume ) by city crews .\nOn a recent visit to town , the leaves were piled high streetside , and the ubiquitous American flags on porches had become crowded by seasonal Halloween company , in the form of carved pumpkins , fake cobwebs , giant plastic spiders and novelty skeletons .\nBy the numbers , the region is thriving in an America with Trump for president . Local cheers went up last month when the US commerce department released data showing that the Lehigh Valley , where Northampton is located , had set a record for economic output in 2016 , with gains in transportation , warehousing , insurance , real estate and manufacturing . Warehouse workers are enjoying a bidding war for their services , the local Morning Call newspaper reported recently . Economic clouds linger , especially in the county ’ s northern reaches . But , in general , the picture is sunny .\nMatthew Dietz , 40 , is a corporate pilot flying out of the Allentown airport who grew up in the Slate Belt in the north of the county . He ’ s busy , but a lot of people in the Slate Belt have not regained a level of employment they knew when the region ’ s clothing mills and slate quarries were still booming , he said .\nThough the area has not seen a direct economic bounce from Trump , Dietz said , support for him remains solid .\n“ I think those that were for him before the election are still there , and those that were against are still in that camp as well , ” he said . “ I agree with a lot of the stuff that he ’ s working towards , and of course if he wasn ’ t so vocal , I think he ’ d get a little bit more done . But that ’ s his style that he was elected on , so .\n“ Locally , we haven ’ t necessarily seen any new jobs or anything created up there , but obviously most everyone has retirement locked up in the stock market , which is great and gives them some security .\n“ On the local level , I ’ d say that ’ s the biggest impact that we ’ ve seen . ”\nTrump regularly touts the huge surge in the stock market since he was elected , and his supporters are likewise quick to point out the Wall Street gains as an example of how life is good under Trump .\n“ We ’ re full employment here , pretty much , ” said D ’ Ambrosio , the barber . “ The one thing that the little guy got for him is the Dow hit 23,000 , and if you have a 401 ( k ) [ retirement savings plan ] , they see it growing . Even the guys that don ’ t like him say it ’ s the Trump effect . ”\nFrank Hawkey , who worked at Bethlehem steel for 31 years and who brands Trump a “ psychopath ” , said that at his current job as a bus driver , “ tons ” of Trump voters had grown sour on the president , though “ you still have that few that say , ‘ he ’ s doing a great job , look at the stock market . ’\n“ Oh really ? That ’ s who he wants to help . The people who have stocks . You know , ‘ How many stocks do you have ? ’\nD ’ Ambrosio , who owns rental properties and does some investing on the side , is way more upbeat . “ I ’ m beating my broker ! ” he said . “ I ’ m actually doing so much better than my broker it ’ s unbelievable . ”\nBruce Haines , a former steel executive and local businessman , said he remained a strong supporter of the president , but he was concerned “ that the bold agenda will get watered down , ” especially on taxes .\nHaines was disappointed , he said , that Trump had caved to pressure from big business interests such as retail giant Walmart to remove a proposed border tax on US imports from his fiscal blueprint . Such a tax was needed , Haines said , to create the kind of renaissance in US manufacturing that Trump described during the campaign .\n“ I don ’ t think we ’ ve seen the dramatic changes with new manufacturing opening , coming back from overseas , for example , which you would hope to see – but it is going to take awhile , ” Haines said . “ With the exception of the border tax , I think he ’ s still trying to enact his bold agenda , and that ’ s why I support him . ”\nTrump voters who admit to impatience with the enactment of key planks in his agenda – tax cuts , border wall construction , healthcare reform , a travel ban – to a person blame Congress , not the president , for the delays .\nLance Prator , mayor of Portland in the extreme north-east of the county , said he wanted to see a border wall built “ because you need to take care of the home front , ” but he did not feel impatient about it .\n“ Even in Portland , we work at the speed of government , ” Prator said . “ I understand the speed of government . You can ’ t just magically wave a wand and build a wall . It ’ ll probably be 25 years after it ’ s all said and done that the first brick will be put down . ”\nIt was a nice day for a ballgame , but the IronPigs minor league baseball team had already lost their league and the season was long over . Instead , Coca-Cola baseball park in Allentown was hosting a forum for candidates in the county executive races to be held early next month .\nAudience members grazed the buffet , sponsored by regional manufacturing giant Air Products , and drained coffee from urns the shape of the iron ore blast furnaces as seen in a mural at the ballpark , or in person six miles away .\nRepublican John Brown , the current Northampton county executive , spoke at the forum about open space preservation , bridge maintenance and the slump in the Slate Belt . Afterwards , he observed that a climate of acrimony that seemed to seep into life in the region a year or two ago had not fully dissipated .\n“ Everything is an argument , ” he said . “ And I find that very interesting that that has not waned . That that has kind of expanded and accelerated . Things have taken on a much more abrasive nature . I ’ m not sure where it ’ s coming from .\n“ You can point to Trump ’ s election , but it ’ s not always political , and it ’ s almost as if there ’ s still a wake that ’ s following everything , that still – everything else is still getting washed through , after years of being submerged . It ’ s something else . ”\nJeff Fox , up in Pen Argyl , saw the same thing . “ I think if Trump ran today , it would be messy , ” Fox said . “ I think the problem is – me personally – I believe that the problem really goes beyond politics . It comes to how we treat one another , how we converse with one another . ”\nFor Duane Miller in his paint store , the picture was no rosier . “ The people are disgusted , ” he said . “ They ’ re absolutely saying , we don ’ t care . Tax cut – who believes it ? Healthcare – who believes it ?\n“ The political climate for the average American , from my point of view here in the little town of Bangor , is one of disbelief . The American people don ’ t believe anything any more .

    "238": "The Sky is Falling ! Maybe , but it really should n't be .\nThe Obama administration 's list of what will happen if upcoming spending cuts go into effect is downright terrifying . In recent days , officials have warned of more forest fires , workplace deaths and , heaven-forbid - chicken shortages .\nAnd today the White House brought out Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood to warn of big air travel delays across the country as air traffic controllers are forced off the job because of budget cuts .\nREAD : The full list of alleged consequences from the sequester\nLaHood even suggested that some smaller airports - he specifically mentioned the airport at golfing paradise Hilton Head , S.C. - might have to reduce hours of operation or even temporarily close . That should catch the eye of avid golfer and Speaker of the House John Boehner .\nThere 's no doubt that the automatic spending cuts set to go into effect on March 1 will cause some real pain and many economists believe they would hurt the economy . But all the dire warnings give the impression the cuts are much larger than they actually are .\nThe Department of Transportation 's budget for 2013 is $ 74.2 billion . The automatic spending cuts would slice $ 1 billion out of its budget : that is a cut of less than 1.4 percent .\nAnd consider this : even if the cuts go into effect , the Department of Transportation will spend more money this year ( $ 73.2 billion ) than it spent last year ( $ 72.6 billion ) .\nThe administration is saying that the Department of Transportation can not squeeze 1.4 percent of its budget without sending air traffic controllers home and that they can not find a way to operate effectively this year with a budget that is actually larger than the budget they had last year .\nThat may be true , but it raises larger questions about the government 's ability to find relatively modest savings without cutting essential services .\nI asked Secretary LaHood about this at today 's White House briefing :\nKARL : Ca n't you find some other way to cut without telling air traffic controllers to stay home ?\nLAHOOD : This has to be a part of it . DOT has 55,000 employees . The largest number of those employees are at the FAA , and the largest number of those employees are controllers , and they 're all over the country . There has to be some impact in order to save a billion dollars . A billion dollars is a lot of money .\nKARL : Let 's be clear : It 's less than 2 percent of your budget .\nAnother fact lost amidst all the dire warnings is that although the cuts go into effect on March 1 , most of the impact wo n't be felt until weeks or even months after that .\nHere 's why : On March 1 , the federal government will give employees 30 days notice that they may have to take unpaid leave ( furlough ) . That means the first furloughs can not happen until March 31 at the earliest . For employees of the Department of Transportation , the most they will be asked to take is one unpaid day off every two weeks .\nAt the White House today , Press Secretary Jay Carney insisted the administration is not exaggerating when it warns of more forest fires , chicken shortages and long air travel delays .\n`` I think all of those things come from reduced , you know , numbers of people fighting fires , you know , reduced numbers of people doing inspections of our food , reduced numbers of people , you know , engaging in air traffic control , '' Carney said . `` I mean , those are just the facts .

    "239": "( CNN ) – Political figures reacted to the release of Supreme Court rulings Monday on the controversial Arizona immigration law and over campaign finance .\nThe high court struck down key parts of the Arizona bill , voting 5-3 that the federal government has the power to block the state 's measure . However , the court upheld one of the most controversial parts of the bill – a provision that allows police to check a person 's immigration status while enforcing other laws if `` reasonable suspicion '' exists that the person is in the United States illegally .\nThey also turned aside another chance to revisit one of its most controversial decisions in recent years , rejecting a pending state appeal over whether corporations have explained `` free speech '' power in independent election expenditures .\nPresident Barack Obama : `` I am pleased that the Supreme Court has struck down key provisions of Arizona 's immigration law . What this decision makes unmistakably clear is that Congress must act on comprehensive immigration reform . A patchwork of state laws is not a solution to our broken immigration system – it 's part of the problem .\nAt the same time , I remain concerned about the practical impact of the remaining provision of the Arizona law that requires local law enforcement officials to check the immigration status of anyone they even suspect to be here illegally . I agree with the Court that individuals can not be detained solely to verify their immigration status . No American should ever live under a cloud of suspicion just because of what they look like . Going forward , we must ensure that Arizona law enforcement officials do not enforce this law in a manner that undermines the civil rights of Americans , as the Court 's decision recognizes . Furthermore , we will continue to enforce our immigration laws by focusing on our most important priorities like border security and criminals who endanger our communities , and not , for example , students who earn their education – which is why the Department of Homeland Security announced earlier this month that it will lift the shadow of deportation from young people who were brought to the United States as children through no fault of their own .\nI will work with anyone in Congress who 's willing to make progress on comprehensive immigration reform that addresses our economic needs and security needs , and upholds our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants . And in the meantime , we will continue to use every federal resource to protect the safety and civil rights of all Americans , and treat all our people with dignity and respect . We can solve these challenges not in spite of our most cherished values – but because of them . What makes us American is not a question of what we look like or what our names are . What makes us American is our shared belief in the enduring promise of this country – and our shared responsibility to leave it more generous and more hopeful than we found it . ''\nMitt Romney , presumptive Republican presidential nominee : `` Today 's decision underscores the need for a President who will lead on this critical issue and work in a bipartisan fashion to pursue a national immigration strategy . President Obama has failed to provide any leadership on immigration . This represents yet another broken promise by this President . I believe that each state has the duty–and the right–to secure our borders and preserve the rule of law , particularly when the federal government has failed to meet its responsibilities . As Candidate Obama , he promised to present an immigration plan during his first year in office . But 4 years later , we are still waiting . ''\nRepublican Arizona Gov . Jan Brewer : `` Today 's decision by the U.S. Supreme Court is a victory for the rule of law . It is also a victory for the 10th Amendment and all Americans who believe in the inherent right and responsibility of states to defend their citizens . After more than two years of legal challenges , the heart of SB 1070 can now be implemented in accordance with the U.S . Constitution . ''\nFormer Sen. Rick Santorum , R-Pennsylvania : `` It 's time for the federal government to step up to its constitutional responsibility to secure our borders , enforce our immigration laws fairly , and to partner with states rather than sue them to accomplish this important objective . ''\nSen. Chuck Schumer , D-New York : `` This is as strong a repudiation of the Arizona law as one could expect given that the law has not been implemented yet . Three linchpins of the Arizona law were struck down by a convincing majority of the Court as clearly violating federal law , and a fourth is on thin legal ice . The Court is sending a stern warning to Arizona that the provision allowing local law enforcement to check people 's immigration documents can not be implemented in a discriminatory or draconian way , or it will be thrown out like the rest of the law .\nThis decision tells us that states can not take the law into their own hands and makes it clear that the only real solution to immigration reform is a comprehensive federal law . The decision should importune Republicans and Democrats to work together on this issue in a bipartisan way . ''\nSens . John McCain and Jon Kyl , R-Arizona : “ While we still want to fully review the Supreme Court ’ s decision , today ’ s ruling appears to validate a key component of Arizona ’ s immigration law , SB 1070 . The Arizona law was born out of the state ’ s frustration with the burdens that illegal immigration and continued drug smuggling impose on its schools , hospitals , criminal justice system and fragile desert environment , and an administration that chooses to set enforcement policies based on a political agenda , not the laws as written by Congress . We will continue our efforts on behalf of the citizens of Arizona to secure our southern border . We believe Arizonans are better served when state and federal officials work as partners to protect our citizens rather than as litigants in a courtroom . ”\nSen. Harry Reid , D-Nevada : `` The Supreme Court was right to strike down the vast majority of the Arizona law . With three out of the four provisions being struck down , the ruling shows that the Obama administration was right to challenge this law , which was not just ill-advised but also unconstitutional . I am greatly concerned that the provision putting American citizens in danger of being detained by police unless they carry their immigration papers at all times will lead to a system of racial profiling . This is a strong reminder that ultimately , the responsibility for fixing our nation ’ s broken immigration system lies with Congress . ''\nSen. Scott Brown , R-Massachusetts : `` The Court 's decision today is another reminder that the federal government needs to deal with our broken immigration system . I believe the first step is securing the border and turning off the magnets that encourage people to come into country illegally . We are a nation of immigrants and should fix the system to make it easier for people seeking to enter our country legally , but we are also a nation of laws that have to be respected and observed . Elizabeth Warren has the wrong approach . She supports amnesty and taxpayer funded benefits , including in-state college tuition , for those in the country illegally . She wants to make illegal immigration more attractive . I want to strengthen our legal immigration system and provide more opportunities for those who have played by the rules . ''\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus : `` Once again we are reminded that President Obama has failed to keep his promise on immigration reform . In the absence of presidential leadership , states have acted on their own to serve their people and enforce the law , but the issue can not fully be resolved with a president unwilling to keep his promises . This decision makes that job even more difficult , and it leaves Americans waiting for a plan the president promised to deliver years ago . ''\nRep. Charles Gonzalez , chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus : `` When three out of four provisions of a state 's law are struck down , it obviously ca n't be viewed as a victory for the state . Nor can an unconstitutional law be used a model for the nation , as Governor Romney suggested . The fact the Romney has said that as president he would not even challenge Arizona 's law , shows what a sad direction our country 's immigration laws would go under his administration .\n`` The 'show me your papers ' provision , that institutionalizes racial profiling , remains a very important element that needs to be addressed . The CHC will coordinate with civil rights groups and immigration law organizations to follow up on a challenge to this provision , which is still an open legal question . We will be watching very closely how Arizona exercises this part of the law and will continue to fight against instances of racial and ethnic profiling . ''\nAttorney General Eric Holder : “ I welcome the Supreme Court ’ s decision to strike down major provisions of Arizona ’ s S.B . 1070 on federal preemption grounds . Today ’ s ruling appropriately bars the State of Arizona from effectively criminalizing unlawful status in the state and confirms the federal government ’ s exclusive authority to regulate in the area of immigration .\n“ While I am pleased the Court confirmed the serious constitutional questions the government raised regarding Section 2 , I remain concerned about the impact of Section 2 , which requires law enforcement officials to verify the immigration status of any person lawfully stopped or detained when they have reason to suspect that the person is here unlawfully . As the Court itself recognized , Section 2 is not a license to engage in racial profiling and I want to assure communities around this country that the Department of Justice will continue to vigorously enforce federal prohibitions against racial and ethnic discrimination . We will closely monitor the impact of S.B . 1070 to ensure compliance with federal immigration law and with applicable civil rights laws , including ensuring that law enforcement agencies and others do not implement the law in a manner that has the purpose or effect of discriminating against the Latino or any other community .\n“ We will also work to ensure that the verification provision does not divert police officers away from traditional law enforcement efforts in order to enforce federal immigration law , potentially impairing local policing efforts and discouraging crime victims , including children of non-citizens , victims of domestic violence , and asylum seekers , from reporting abuses and crimes out of fear of detention or deportation . We will continue to use every federal resource to protect the safety and civil rights of all Americans . ”\nSen. Mitch McConnell , R-Kentucky : `` In another important victory for freedom of speech , the Supreme Court has reversed the Montana Supreme Court , upholding First Amendment free speech rights that were set out in Citizens United . As I pointed out in an amicus brief that I filed in the Montana case , a review of Federal Election Commission records of independent spending supporting the eight Republican presidential candidates earlier this year showed only minimal corporate involvement in the 2012 election cycle . Not one Fortune 100 company contributed a cent to any of the eight Republican Super PACs , as of the end of March , according to FEC records . The records also showed that of the $ 96 million contributed to the eight Super PACs through March 31 , an overwhelming 86.32 percent of that money came from individuals while only 13.68 percent came from corporations and 0.81 percent from public companies . Clearly , the much predicted corporate tsunami that critics of Citizens United warned about simply did not occur . ''\nSen. Chuck Schumer , D-New York : “ Even as the current election cycle exposes the folly of the reasoning behind the Citizens United decision , the Supreme Court persists with its anything-goes interpretation of the First Amendment . For apparently political reasons , the Supreme Court is further tipping the balance of power in America in favor of deep-pocketed , outside interests . ”\nRep. Nancy Pelosi , D-California : `` Today , the Supreme Court kept open the floodgates to uninhibited special interest spending in our campaigns and in our politics . Their disappointing decision to uphold Citizens United deals yet another blow to a fundamental American value : that the voices of the people determine the outcome of our elections , not the checkbooks of the few .\n`` Democrats are committed to restoring transparency , accountability , openness , and fairness to our political process . Our strategy is simple : we must DARE – to fight for disclosure and shine a bright light on secret donations ; to amend the Constitution to overturn the crushing Citizens United ruling ; to reform the system and empower small donors and the grassroots ; and to elect reform-minded candidates and leaders to office .

    "240": "Washington ( CNN ) - Saying `` we will respond to the threat of climate change , '' President Barack Obama used his second inaugural address to put the divisive issue back on the front burner . But according to a new national survey , Americans are divided over whether global warming is a man made phenomenon .\nThe president also used his speech to highlight the controversial issue of illegal immigration , and a CNN/ORC International survey released Tuesday also indicates that a bare majority of the public says the main focus of the federal government should be on developing a plan that would allow undocumented immigrants to become legal residents , rather than deporting them .\nThe president warned in his Monday address that failure to respond to climate change `` would betray our children and future generations . Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science , but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires , and crippling drought , and more powerful storms . ''\nAccording to the poll , which was conducted last week , 49 % agree with the White House that global warming is a proven fact and is due to emissions from cars , power plants and factories . That 's twice as high as the number who say that global warming has not been proven , as well as the 24 % who say that it is a proven fact but is not due to manmade sources . But the 49 % figure is down seven points from 2007 .\nThere 's an expected partisan divide on the question , with two-thirds of Democrats saying global warming is man made . That number drops to 48 % among independent voters and is at 28 % among Republicans .\nThe president tried and failed in his first term to get a climate change bill through Congress . The president also came up empty during his first four years in the White House in trying to pass comprehensive illegal immigration reform though Congress .\nBut Obama has put the issue on his to-do list this year , and in his inaugural address he said `` our journey is not complete until we find a better way to welcome the striving , hopeful immigrants who still see America as a land of opportunity ; until bright young students and engineers are enlisted in our workforce rather than expelled from our country . ''\nBy a 53 % -43 % margin , people questioned in the poll say that main focus of the federal government should be on developing a plan that would allow undocumented immigrants to become legal residents , rather than deporting them .\nThat 's a switch from 2011 , when by a 55 % -42 % margin , Americans said that deporting undocumented residents and stopping more of them from coming into the country should be the main focus of U.S policy on illegal immigration .\nAs expected , the poll indicates a partisan divide on the issue , as well as a generational divide , with younger people saying allowing undocumented immigrants to become legal should be the top priority , and a slight plurality of those 50 and older saying the emphasis should be on deportation and border security .\nOne of the president 's biggest domestic accomplishments in his first term was passing a sweeping health care bill through Congress in 2010 . In his inauguration address , Obama acknowledged that there is still much work ahead on this issue , saying `` we must make the hard choices to reduce the cost of health care . ''\nAccording to the poll , 51 % favor all or most of the provisions in the Affordable Care Act , the official name of what many people refer to as `` Obamacare , '' with 44 % opposed to all or most of the provisions in the law .\n`` That 's a switch from 2011 , when a CNN poll indicated that a majority opposed all or most of the provisions in the health care bill , '' says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland .\nMinutes after his inauguration speech , the president signed documents making official his nominations for some top Cabinet posts , including former Sen. Chuck Hagel as defense secretary . The Nebraska Republican 's nomination has been met with reservations , and even outright opposition , by some senators of both parties , who point to past positions he has taken on Israel , Iran and the war in Iraq .\nAccording to the poll , 48 % think the Senate should confirm Hagel .\n`` That 's twice as high as the number who oppose his confirmation , but with three in ten uncertain of how they feel about the issue , the White House might breathe a little easier if support for Hagel were just over 50 % rather than just under that mark , '' adds Holland .\nThe poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International on Jan. 14-15 , with 814 adults nationwide questioned by telephone .

    "241": "Washington ( CNN ) – The push in Washington over reducing the federal deficit and producing a balanced budget should n't be at the expense of vulnerable Americans , President Barack Obama said in an interview on Tuesday .\nHis comments came the same day Rep. Paul Ryan , the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee , unveiled a plan that aims to balance the budget in 10 years .\nObama said his own plan , which the White House said should be out the week of April 8 , would not include that objective .\n`` My goal is not to chase a balanced budget just for the sake of balance , '' Obama told ABC News . `` My goal is how do we grow the economy , put people back to work , and if we do that we are going to be bringing in more revenue . If we control spending and we have a smart entitlement package , then potentially what you have is balance – but it is not balance on the backs of the poor , the elderly , students who need student loans , families that have disabled kids . That is not the right way to balance our budget . ''\nIn the budget presented Tuesday , Ryan proposes balancing the budget over a decade , finding savings in government spending by eliminating most of Obama 's health care reforms and streamlining the federal tax code . The plan closely mimicked Ryan 's previous budget plans , which have been harshly criticized by Democrats , including Obama .\nThe president was n't any less biting in his assessment of Ryan 's plan Tuesday , saying the cuts included in the budget were indefensible .\n`` We 're not going to balance the budget in 10 years , '' Obama said . `` If you look at what Paul Ryan does to balance the budget , it means that you have to 'voucherize ' Medicare , you have to slash deeply into programs like Medicaid , you 've essentially got to either tax middle class families a lot higher than you currently are , or you ca n't lower rates the way he 's promised . ''\nInstead , Obama pointed to measures enacted during the presidency of Bill Clinton – where his interviewer , ABC 's George Stephanopoulos , served as an adviser .\n`` Balancing the budget depends , in part , how fast you grow . You remember , you were in the Clinton administration . The reason you guys balanced it was a combination of tax hikes , spending cuts - and the economy grew , '' Obama said . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "242": "The National Enquirer boss ’ s deal appears to be more bad news for the president in a bad week\nAfter Michael Cohen stood in court Tuesday and said that a candidate for office – Donald Trump – had directed him to broker hush payments to two women , the details of the payments and the nature of their illegality became extremely urgent questions .\nDavid Pecker : Trump confidant and National Enquirer boss was given immunity in Cohen case Read more\nIt was suddenly clear that a sitting president might have committed a crime during his candidacy . As Cohen ’ s attorney Lanny Davis put it : “ If those payments were a crime for Michael Cohen , then why wouldn ’ t they be a crime for Donald Trump ? ”\nBut federal prosecutors were a step ahead , it appears . In bombshell news stories Tuesday , Vanity Fair and the Wall Street Journal reported that two witnesses – the magazine publisher David Pecker and one of his chief officers , Dylan Howard – had been granted immunity in exchange for their testimony in the matter .\nThe negotiations between prosecutors in the southern district of New York and Pecker and Howard had not been previously disclosed before Thursday . Trump has denied all wrongdoing .\nThe immunity deals appear to be more bad news for Trump in a bad week . If Trump did break the law in connection with the hush payments , the testimony of Pecker and Howard could provide evidence of the crime , because they were involved in both transactions , the Wall Street Journal reported . Or their testimony could be used to prosecute someone else in the Trump Organization or his presidential campaign .\nIn one transaction , the executives helped to arrange for one of their publications , the National Enquirer , to pay $ 150,000 to the former Playboy model Karen McDougal for exclusive rights to her story of an alleged affair with Trump . The story was never published .\nIn a second transaction , Cohen contacted the lawyer who had brokered the McDougal deal , Keith M Davidson , to reach a deal with the pornographic actor Stormy Daniels for a $ 130,000 payment . The role of Pecker and Howard in that second transaction was unclear .\nPecker is a longtime friend of Trump ’ s , a past frequent guest at the president ’ s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and the former publisher of a magazine called Trump Style . During the 2016 presidential campaign , the National Enquirer was an essential ally of the Republican known for railing against “ fake news ” , publishing one cover story announcing that Hillary Clinton had six months to live and another that Ted Cruz ’ s father was “ linked to JFK assassination ! ” .\nTrump repeated the latter story on Fox News in May 2016 , when Cruz was a primary opponent , saying : “ His father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald ’ s being – you know , shot . I mean , the whole thing is ridiculous. ” ( Indeed the allegation is ridiculous . )\nDoes the prosecutors ’ interest in Pecker and Howard mean that they are investigating someone higher up than Cohen , who has already pleaded guilty ?\nDavid Pecker , the tabloid king : meet Trump 's friend and fixer Read more\nThat depends on when the reported immunity deal was made , said Ryan Goodman , a professor at the NYU School of Law and founding co-editor-in-chief of the website Just Security .\n“ A lot might turn on when prosecutors granted immunity to Pecker and Howard , because if it ’ s earlier on in time , it could mean that they were simply building the case against Michael Cohen , ” Goodman said .\n“ But the wording of the reporting in Vanity Fair , if true , suggests that the prosecutors are looking specifically at the president himself .\n“ The president himself can ’ t sleep easy knowing that this is what ’ s occurred in the case . ” \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "243": "Nowadays , states are often referred to as `` laboratories of democracy , '' based on a line from Justice Louis Brandeis stating federalism allows that `` a single courageous State may , if its citizens choose , serve as a laboratory ; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country . ''\nImplicit in this formulation is the scientific method—trying things out , and learning from the results . But science is in ill repute with the increasingly rigid , ideological GOP these days . For them , the question of what 's to be learned is not how to produce beneficial results , but how to repackage and sell disasters as shining examples of “ success . ”\nWhich helps explain how it comes that two of America 's most ambitious GOP governors are now deep in denial that their imaginary budget schemes lie in ruins .\nAs their state 's legislative sessions came to an end , Kansas Gov . Sam Brownback and Louisiana Gov . Bobby Jindal could both claim they were about to sign balanced budgets—by law , they had no choice—but Brownback did so only with a massive sales tax hike , while Jindal raided the piggy bank for one-time funds that will only make things more difficult for his successor .\nBoth men deeply antagonized their state legislatures in the process—legislatures dominated by their own party . Brownback once harbored White House dreams , but has since put away childish things . Jindal has yet to grow up . And why should he ? He 's much more popular in New Hampshire than in his home state , as USA Today noted in May .\nBoth governors ' budget shenanigans are reminiscent of how George W. Bush made the case for WMD in Iraq , but without even the thinnest veil of secrecy hiding the arm-twisting , manipulation and outright lying . Talking points and Fox News headlines—the only justifications GOP spinmeisters care about—leave both men in a credible light for those viewing them at a distance or through a partisan lens .\nBut on-the-ground blow-by-blow accounts reveal both men as bullies , liars and fools , who 've gotten what they wanted—not their original goals , but ( barely ) face-saving measures—by threatening the most vulnerable and imperiling future generations . In Kansas , the Wichita Eagle story on the budget accord recounted the threats that were raised :\nThe Brownback administration warned Thursday that it would cut the budget Monday if lawmakers had not acted by then . Officials raised the specter of either a 6.2 percent across-the-board cut , which would cost schools nearly $ 200 million , or a veto of budgets for the state ’ s regents universities .\nRep. Jim Ward—a Democrat representing southeast Wichita—tweeted his translation : `` Brownback message to Republicans-Do it my way or I shoot the hostages ( school kids , college kids , disabled ) # ksleg ''\nAnd Sen. Jeff Longbine—a Republican representing Emporia—said , “ I am sick of being blackmailed . ”\nKansas City Star opinion writer Yael T. Abouhalkah provided more details in his blog :\nFiguratively , the governor appears willing to shoot the already-beleaguered schools in the foot , making them bear further financial pain because his cherished income tax breaks for businesses have drained money needed to provide crucial state services . It ’ s the newest ploy being used by Brownback to force the Kansas Legislature to pass the largest tax increase in state history and close a $ 400 million budget gap . On Tuesday , officials in the Kansas City , Kan. ( $ 11 million in potential lost funds ) , Olathe ( $ 10 million ) , Shawnee Mission ( $ 8 million ) and Blue Valley ( $ 6 million ) districts were scrambling to find out what they could do to protect the educational needs of their students . In addition , higher education leaders were looking at cutbacks of about $ 50 million .\nBrownback repeatedly threatened to veto any attempt to repeal the business income tax breaks , which are now more psychologically important to him than ever . The broad case for cutting taxes has become untenable—Brownback himself pushed for a sales tax increase to 6.65 percent , the legislature settled on 6.5 percent , up from 6.15 percent—leading Brownback to shift ground : taxing income is bad , taxing spending is good .\nBrownback praised what he called “ a pro-growth tax policy ” after its passage . “ This bill keeps the state on a path of economic growth , creating well-paying jobs that benefit all Kansans . It continues our transition from taxes on productivity to consumption-based taxes , ” he said in a statement .\nBut this revised claim is utterly bogus . We can see this in broad terms , as Kansas continues to lag behind national job-creation rates , as it has ever since Brownback took office in January 2011 . We can understand its bogosity more precisely by taking a close look at what it actually does , as the Kansas Center for Economic Growth did on its website with a May 28 post , “ Business Tax Exemption Not a Roadmap to a Stronger Economy , ” in which it pointed out :\nLess than 1 percent of all Kansas small businesses saw a tax savings of just over $ 38,000 . This might be enough to hire one worker full-time , depending on wage and benefits . But , if you were to hire a full-time employee with that money , after paying for benefits the take-home pay would be $ 26,600 or about $ 12.80 an hour . That ’ s barely above the federal poverty level for a family of three – not a roadmap to a stronger economy .\nGiven the magnitude of the lie Brownback was pushing , it was n't enough to just threaten children 's education ; lawmakers themselves had to be bullied and abused . Daily Kos blogger Chris Reeves , whose Kansas budget coverage has been cited by the Columbia Journalism Review , focused on what the lawmakers had been through after a 4 a.m. final vote :\nFor one moment , I want to put aside the bill and talk about our citizen legislators , Republicans and Democrats , who subjected themselves to what the Geneva convention refers to as torture - a 24-hour period with no schedule of sleep available of more than 4 contiguous hours .\nSuch treatment is abhorrent for anyone , of course . But what of those who should err on the side of more rest ? A key figure Reeves writes about is Heinz Dierks , a man in his 70s whose wife , Diana Dierks , 71 , a moderate Republican , represents Salina . `` I 'm here to look out for her , '' Heinz Dierks said . And she was there to do her civic duty—a concept utterly foreign to men like Brownback and Jindal .\nIn some respects , what happened in Louisiana was even worse . The pure chaos and dysfunction in Louisiana—and Jindal 's utter failure as a political leader—was widely commented on by those who cover such things .\nThe tone was set back on May 20 , just after the legislature had definitively killed action on Jindal 's proposed so-called religious freedom law , which , like Indiana 's hastily withdrawn version , would have been a license to discriminate , when Julia O'Donoghue wrote a piece for the Times-Picayune , “ Louisiana lawmakers have trashed Bobby Jindal 's legislative agenda. ” Not only had legislators rebuffed Jindal on the right to discriminate—the only piece of legislation he mentioned specifically in his opening speech to the legislature this year , and the subject of almost a third of that speech—but they also refused to follow his lead on two other top priorities :\nIn his opening remarks for the legislative session , Jindal laid out three priorities—the state budget , Common Core and the religious freedom bill . The Legislature has n't taken his lead of any of these issues , choosing instead to come up with their own solutions to these problems .\nHowever , as the legislature finished up its business , Will Sentell of the Advocate wrote a piece , “ Budget problems easily dominate 2015 Legislature , ” quoting key legislators and noting that everyone expected the budget “ would be the key topic , ” but that “ bitter and time-consuming debates over how to address the problem all but drowned other topics expected to draw attention . ”\nIn short , the legislature passed a budget , and that was pretty much it . But as Tyler Bridges also reported for the Advocate , “ while they solved the immediate crisis , Jindal and legislators fumbled the more arduous task of putting the state ’ s finances on sounder footing for the coming years , ” going on to say :\nThe $ 24.5 billion budget passed Thursday night contains so many short-term fixes that next year ’ s governor and Legislature will inherit a budget deficit of an estimated $ 1 billion , documents show , and the size of the deficit is only projected to grow in the following years .\nIn light of all this , not surprisingly , two different lists of winners and losers pegged Jindal as loser in all this , and Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform as a big winner—though as Louisiana political journalist and historian Robert Mann noted here at ███ , Norquist 's smoke-and-mirrors-based victory may well have been Pyrrhic . At its heart lies Jindal 's SAVE program , as Mann explained :\nJindal and his staff proposed a convoluted , confusing student fee/tax credit “ offset , ” devised only so Jindal could claim his actions were “ revenue neutral ” and , therefore , did not increase taxes . With Norquist ’ s approval , Jindal pushed the so-called Student Assessment for a Valuable Education ( SAVE ) Credit Program .\nUnder SAVE , students will be assessed a $ 1,500 fee , which will be offset by a $ 1,500 tax credit . No actual money will change hands , but as the Advocate of Baton Rouge explained , “ the SAVE fund would create a tax credit for the $ 350 million that Jindal could use to offset $ 350 million of the new revenue that legislators are proposing to raise. ” The student fees magically disappear from this accounting , because # Freedom ! But the magic will likely have a very short half-life . As Mann goes on to say , “ The real impact of what should be called 'the Jindal-Norquist Tax Cover-up Bill of 2015 ' may be the eventual destruction of ATR ’ s anti-tax increase pledge . ”\nIn her winners and losers roundup for the Times-Picayune , Julia O'Donoghue made the case for Norquist as winner , stressing his rule-setting role , though noting his embattled national status at the end :\nBack in February , Jindal put forward an initial budget proposal that he knew Norquist would approve . The Louisiana Senate also mostly worked within the parameters laid out by Norquist . Every financial decision was shaped by the anti-tax advocate and his supporters . At one point , some Louisiana legislators reached out to Norquist directly to try to convince him to change his opinion on one piece of legislation . [ Story here . Mann 's scathing take here . ] Jindal may be courting Norquist because his organization is influential in national Republican politics and the governor is expected to run for president in 2016 . But Norquist also has an interest in keeping Jindal on his side , as he faces fallout from Republicans in a few other states—notably Alabama and Kansas .\nBut Clancy DuBos offered a grittier take at the Best of New Orleans , with his list of “ Da winnas & da loozas , ” which cited Norquist as a winner because “ he has more sway in the Louisiana Legislature than the current governor , ” adding hastily that “ It ’ s not because he ’ s so powerful , but rather because our governor and too many lawmakers are so spineless — proving once again that in politics , as in tennis , it ’ s possible to win by default . ”\nAs for Jindal , heading up the list of “ da loozas , ” DuBos left no doubt as to why :\nHe pitched three priorities on Opening Day : repealing Common Core , passing a “ religious freedom ” bill , and ending “ corporate welfare ” ( the state-funded inventory tax rebate ) . He went 0 for 3 , gave Louisiana its largest tax hike in memory , spent most of his time campaigning for president , and managed to sink even lower in public opinion polls . His last-minute save of “ SAVE ” will be repealed in January by the next Legislature and governor , and his post-session claim of “ revenue neutrality ” will rank alongside George W. Bush ’ s “ Mission Accomplished ” as one of the great Orwellian claims by an American politician . More important , the world now knows that Bobby Jindal is the fiscal equivalent of Bernie Madoff — only nobody actually buys into his budgetary Ponzi scheme . If Jindal somehow gets elected president , his policies will put the U.S. economy on par with that of Greece before the end of his first term .\nShifting focus from Jindal to the political environment he 's damaged so completely , a case can be made that institutional damage in Louisiana was deeper than in Kansas , but at least politicians have begun to fight back . Hence AP 's wrap-up analysis headline “ Frayed relations could lead to significant change. ” The story by Melinda Deslatte began with the sort of blunt on-the-ground reporting that ought to end Jindal 's career :\nFrustration , even outright anger , with Gov . Bobby Jindal has been simmering in the Louisiana Legislature for years , building as the Republican governor ’ s presidential ambitions grew more obvious . But widespread legislative sentiment that Jindal has been making decisions based on a GOP presidential campaign he ’ s expected to announce June 24 may have a silver lining for the state , possibly putting limits on the next Louisiana governor ’ s power and forcing sweeping change for state budget and tax policy . In the just-ended legislative session , senators enacted changes to their leadership selection process aimed at limiting a governor ’ s meddling and increasing legislative independence . Lawmakers in both the House and Senate agreed to curtail the broad records exemptions granted to the governor , to provide more information to the public . And the state ’ s financial situation — hamstrung by Jindal ’ s rigid positions on tax discussions — has become so troubled that the next governor elected this fall will almost certainly hold a special session to allow the type of wide-ranging , needed debate on the budget and taxes that lawmakers haven ’ t had for years .\nIf the dysfunction in Baton Rouge sounds like Washington , and Jindal 's hostile relationship with his legislators sounds like Obama 's relationship with Congress , there are two little facts to add to sweeten the mix : The first is that Jindal loves to portray himself as the anti-Obama , and the second is that he may have a point : his hostile relationships are with chambers his own party controls .\nJindal 's insistence on being the anti-Obama requires him to produce a conservative policy miracle , and if one ca n't be created in reality , then every piece of smoke and mirrors must be perfectly arranged and dogmatically defended . ( His intensely focused devotion to this is what sets him apart from Brownback . ) We 've already had a peek at the most absurd example of this , Jindal 's SAVE program , but its absurdity needs to be understood as part of a much larger project—a project to make him president . Integral to this project are a set of related claims about how well Jindal has supposedly done in shrinking the size of government—supposedly cutting state payrolls by 30,000 [ shifting them to private contractors , actually ] and cutting state spending by 26 percent , claims he 's repeatedly made to the national political media , such as George Stephanopoulos on ABC 's “ This Week ” on May 31 .\nBut as Mann explained in detail on his blog Something Like the Truth , after that appearance , anyone with an Internet connection could check out state documents and easily see that Jindal was lying . Looking at the budget record during Jindal 's time in office , Mann concludes :\nCalculating the difference between Jindal ’ s first full budget year and his most recent complete budget year ( 2008-09 to 2014-15 ) , total state expenditures actually increased by $ 780 million ( $ 25.06 billion in 08-09 to $ 25.84 billion in 14-15 ) .\nBut that 's not the comparison Jindal is making , Mann notes . He 's comparing himself to his predecessor , Kathleen Blanco 's last year in office—which makes him look better , but still not good enough :\nThe actual difference between Jindal ’ s most recent budget and Blanco ’ s last budget ( $ 2.75 billion ) is a mere 9 percent cut in state expenditures . And here ’ s the kicker : Whatever budget cutting Jindal has achieved appears to come primarily from a decrease in federal funding flowing into the state ’ s coffers ( something largely out of Jindal ’ s control ) .\nThat 's actually an understatement in light of the very next thing Mann tells us :\nBlanco ’ s last budget contained $ 12.88 billion in federal funds . Jindal ’ s last budget contains $ 10.07 billion in federal funds – a drop of $ 2.81 billion . That figure is greater , of course , than the $ 2.75 billion difference in Blanco ’ s last budget and Jindal ’ s most recent .\nSo more than 100 percent of the decrease was outside of Jindal 's control . I 'm really not sure if that 's a good thing or a bad thing , per se . What I do know is that it 's proof he 's a liar .\nDid Jindal cut his state ’ s budget by 26 percent ? Not even close . His own budget figures disprove his claim . The real question is , why do journalists like Stephanopoulos and other national media figures allow Jindal to keep making this false assertion without ever challenging him ?\nWhatever the reason , it 's a profoundly perverse belief . By trusting whatever a politician says , they give the advantage to whichever one tells the outrageously self-serving lie . It 's the worst sort of competition imaginable to encourage . If the aim is to get at the truth , this is exactly the wrong way to go about doing things .\nAs folks in the media ought to know , the way to get at the truth is to start with reporting facts . Then you assemble them and proceed to make sense of their evolution over time . Mann provides an example of this in a piece published at the Times-Picayune website after the budget deal was done , “ Bobby Jindal 's disgraceful fiscal legacy ” picks out a few highlights that illuminate the recurring themes that have run throughout Jindal 's tenure .\nPerhaps the most basic of these is a complete inability to think of anything beyond the immediate—or even to see that clearly . It started with spending the surplus left by his predecessor :\nIn 2008 , Jindal inherited an $ 865 million surplus . He and legislators promptly spent it . That should have been the first hint that he knew little about sound fiscal management .\nThis was followed by misjudging state revenues , and deciding to cut taxes :\nNext , Jindal mistook the post-Katrina revenue boom ( due to a massive infusion of federal money ) for a permanent economic recovery . So , he slashed income taxes in his first regular session . Combined with ill-advised income tax cuts signed earlier by Gov . Kathleen Blanco , it was a mistake that blew an $ 800 million hole in the budget and launched us down the road to our present sad condition .\nWhich in turn created a state of perpetual dishonesty and de facto stealing :\nBecause he surrendered so much revenue in the beginning , Jindal 's budgets have always included obscene amounts of one-time money . Despite bragging that he 's balanced every budget , Jindal ended most fiscal years with a `` structural '' deficit . In other words , he only `` balanced '' the books by draining various savings accounts and trust funds . Those funds were intended for specific purposes , which did not include serving as piggy banks for times when the state 's treasury ran short of cash .\nJindal is hardly unique in this regard . Arnold Schwarzenegger engaged in the exact same sort of short-term juggling act throughout his tenure as governor of California , initiated by blowing a $ 6.5 billion hole in the budget with his grandstanding rollback of the state 's vehicle license fee , then turning to borrowing and gimmickry . The state only regained its long-term fiscal balance after Democrat Jerry Brown was elected in 2010 . It 's not that Brown succeeded where Schwarzenegger failed , the two men were trying to do fundamentally different things . Schwarzenegger was trying to make everything look good on paper , at least for the moment . Brown was trying to run a state , as a steward of it for future generations .\nAlthough Schwarzenegger was widely seen as an anomalously liberal Republican on issues like gay rights and the environment , his budget record clearly revealed the narrow limits , not of Republican solutions to economic challenges , but of Republicans ' ability to even see problems are , as opposed to the secondary and tertiary problems that are entirely of their own making . And the rest of us will be dragged along for the ride , at least as things stand now . As long the national media takes the George Stephanopoulos approach of swallowing GOP lies whole , we will remain mired in failure after failure , without even a clue to what 's going on . If we want to stop being clueless—about the problems as well as the solutions—we 've got to watch what they do , not what they say . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

Sessions didn ’ t deny making any of those vile comments , but he did say he ’ d been quoted out of context .\nWhich is exactly what our fine , upstanding attorney general was forced to explain all over again on Tuesday . Senator Al Franken had asked what Sessions called “ a rambling question after some six hours of testimony ” about Trump campaign contacts with Russians .\nHow could Sessions know that Franken meant “ contacts with Russians ” when he used those words ? Once again , this was plainly a confirmation hearing taken out of context .\n“ I was responding to the allegation that surrogates had been meeting with Russians on a regular basis , ” he said . “ It simply did not occur to me to go further than the context and to list any conversations that I may have had with Russians in routine situations , as I had many routine meetings with other foreign officials . ”\nFor normal folks , meeting with people on a regular basis is the same as meeting with people in routine situations . But not for Jeff Sessions .\nThis isn ’ t the first time Sessions has struggled to tell his side of the story . Back when people were accusing him of racism in Alabama , he admitted he may have called a white civil rights lawyer a “ disgrace to his race ” .\n“ Trying to recollect on it the best I can recall was , and I say , well , he ’ s not that popular around town , ” Sessions told senators in 1986 . “ I ’ ve heard him referred to as a disgrace to his race . ”\nA month later , he insisted he had never said any such thing . “ I am absolutely convinced that I did not call [ him ] a disgrace to his race , and I did not acknowledge it in any form . ”\nWhy this great man finds himself so often ensnared in such confusion remains a puzzle .\nJeff Sessions on Hawaii gaffe : 'Nobody has a sense of humour any more ' Read more\nRecently , he told a conservative radio host that it was incredible that some Hawaii judge could overturn his boss ’ s travel ban on Muslims . “ I really am amazed that a judge sitting on an island in the Pacific can issue an order that stops the president of the United States from what appears to be clearly his statutory and constitutional power , ” Sessions said .\nThat island in the Pacific may be a state with the same statutory and constitutional position as Alabama . But the words of Jeff Sessions were once again being taken out of context .\n“ Nobody has a sense of humor any more , ” he told ABC . “ I wasn ’ t criticizing the judge or the island , ” he told CNN . It ’ s almost like you can ’ t tell KKK jokes any more . What is this country coming to ?\nIt ’ s true that Sessions has moments of memory failure , but the good news is that when confronted with reality , he has immense powers of recall . Even though he initially forgot about meeting the Russians a couple of times , when a reporter asked about those meetings , “ we immediately recalled the conversation , ” he told the senators . “ I never intended not to include that . ”\nAs for a third meeting in the Mayflower Hotel in Washington , Sessions cleared up the confusion in the same way his boss is draining the swamp . “ I would have gladly reported the meeting and encounter that may have occurred , and some say occurred in the Mayflower , if I had remembered it , or it actually occurred , which I don ’ t remember that it did . ”\nTrust Kamala Harris , another Democratic senator with lots of pesky questions , to fail to recognize the deeply honorable nature of our amnesiac attorney general . As she peppered him with questions about whether he communicated with any Russian nationals , Sessions almost let it slip that he might have met a few at the Republican convention . Then he quickly tried to qualify his words to the point of meaninglessness .\n“ I ’ m not able to be rushed this fast , ” he complained . “ It makes me nervous . ”\nThe truth can make you feel nervous . Especially when you ’ re not the man you think you are , if you actually ever were , which you don ’ t remember saying you were . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "245": "“ Equal rights for all , special privileges for none. ” That was the motto of Jacksonian democracy . I ’ m generally not a fan of Jacksonian politics in general , but Jacksonian hostility to “ class legislation , ” or different policies for different classes and categories of citizens , is an idea that people on left , right and center can embrace . Case in point : We need to replace a bewildering miscellany of tax and economic security programs targeted at different constituencies with a few simple and universal policies that are identical for every Americans , rich , poor and middle class .\nLet ’ s start with health care . Following the passage of the Affordable Care Act , we Americans now have a means-tested program for the poor , Medicaid , divided between the federal government and the states ; another means-tested , state-based program for children , SCHIP ( State Children ’ s Health Insurance Program ) ; a purely federal system for the elderly , Medicare ; employer-based health insurance subsidized by the tax code ; a system of tax-subsidized individual health insurance for working-age people purchased through exchanges ; and the Veterans ’ Administration , a separate system for retired military personnel . And those are only the major public health care programs .\nThat ’ s right . We have six separate , major American health care programs , with different streams of revenue and based on different systems . Medicaid and Medicare are single-payer , multiple provider . The Veterans Administration is single-payer/single-provider . The ACA exchanges are based on an individual mandate . Medicare and the VA system and the subsidy to employer-provided health insurance provided by the federal tax code are purely federal policies . Medicaid and the exchanges and SCHIP are partly federal , partly state-based .\nAmerica ’ s health care policies are a dog ’ s breakfast . America ’ s retirement policies are a dog ’ s breakfast that a dog barfed up later .\nWe have a universal , federal public defined benefit ( DB ) system : Social Security . We have federal tax subsidies to employer-based DB pensions . And that ’ s not all . We have a variety of tax-favored private defined contribution ( DC ) systems , including IRAs and 401 ( k ) s. Oh , and most public employees—teachers , fire fighters , police—are covered by separate , public DB pension plans—huge pools of state-controlled money frequently raided by state legislators or milked by finance-industry friends of corrupt state governors and mayors .\nBy my count , that ’ s four distinct major retirement systems in the U.S .\nEducation ? We have public provision : public K-12 and public community colleges and state universities . Outside of this system of direct public educational provision , we have a separate system of federal student loans . And a third system of federal grants . And because three incompatible systems of aiding higher education are not enough—this is America ! —we have yet a fourth , completely different system of tax-favored college savings accounts . America ’ s system of funding higher education is not quite as insanely complicated as our health care and retirement systems . But we ’ re getting there !\nThe political scientist Steven Teles calls this kind of baroque public policy “ kludgeocracy. ” Another way to describe it would be that Rube Goldberg gets elected and promotes various goals—health care , retirement security , educational access—by means of needlessly elaborate contraptions involving candles , levers , and gerbils running on wheels .\nWho benefits from this complexity ? Lobbyists , tax preparers , accountants , and rent-seeking parasites in the private sector who figure out how to game these needlessly elaborate systems to skim money from taxpayers and rate payers . Complexity is the friend of corruption . Simplicity , on the other hand , promotes democracy . So here ’ s a suggestion , in the spirit of Jacksonian frontier violence as well as Jacksonian democracy : Blow it up .\nBlow it all up . Blow up retirement policy , health care policy , and education policy . Replace them with simple , universal , purely federal policies that are the same for everybody , no matter what your income or age or state of residence .\nTotal demolition is not necessary . We can pick one or two of the existing systems in each area and expand them and universalize them , while demolishing the other policies .\nLet ’ s start with health care policy . What should stay and what should go ?\nIn good Jacksonian fashion— “ equal rights for all ” —we prefer universal programs which treat all citizens of all economic classes identically to means-tested programs based on income . So we will keep Medicare and Obamacare ( the exchanges ) and get rid of the means-tested programs , Medicaid and SCHIP . It also makes no sense to maintain a separate medical system for retired military personnel , and recent scandals have cast doubt on the argument that the VA is a model of good medical practice . So let ’ s scrap the VA as well .\nWe could combine universal Obamacare for working-age people with universal Medicare for the elderly . Or we could choose between two universal , lifelong systems : universal , lifelong Medicare or universal , lifelong Obamacare .\nThe main problem with U.S. health care is not on the payer side , but on the provider side—the Big Pharma oligopoly , the hospital oligopoly and the physician cartel use their monopoly power to extort excessive payments from American society . The solution , used even by countries like Switzerland with purely private , individual-mandate systems , is “ all-payer regulation ” —the conversion of the medical-industrial sector from a group of price-gouging profiteers into a publicly-regulated utility with regulated prices . As long as medical prices are regulated and profiteering drug companies , hospitals and doctors are reined in , then health care will be affordable whether you have lifelong universal Medicare or lifelong universal Obamacare .\nNext let ’ s blow up American retirement policy . Let ’ s begin by phasing out employer defined benefit ( DB ) pensions . Your retirement income , like your health care access , should not depend on particular employers .\nThe biggest employer pensions are those of state employees . Many state employees were left out of the Social Security system in 1935 because state public pension systems already existed . That was 80 years ago . It ’ s the 21st century . All American workers—public and private alike—should be part of a single universal retirement system , independent of particular employers .\nIf we get rid of tax-favored pensions from public and private employers alike , we are left with a public DB pension—Social Security—and various private defined contribution ( DC ) plans like IRAs and 401 ( k ) s. Most other democracies have a mix of both systems . We can as well . Let ’ s have a two-tier system : Social Security plus a federal , tax-favored DC plan on top of it ( preferably one less easily gamed by sleazy , fee-skimming money managers ) . The left and right can fight over the relative proportions of Social Security and the tax-favored defined contribution plan . But progressives and conservatives might be able to agree to phase out public and private defined benefit pensions .\nEducation policy ? Here , too , there is a need for incineration , followed by reconstruction .\nThe student loan system has turned out to be one of the biggest policy errors in American history—saddling students with debt while enriching bankers and indirectly subsidizing bloated university administrations . So let ’ s get rid of federal student loans .\nLet ’ s get rid of Pell grants , too . Pell grants go to students who can ’ t afford to pay for college . But this misdiagnoses the problem , which is affordability on the provider side , not lack of income on the part of the student . We already have a system of public community colleges and state universities . Why not make admission free to all students who get in , as President Obama has suggested in the case of community colleges ? We don ’ t charge students admission to public K-to-12 education . We pay for it with taxes . Let ’ s have a taxpayer-funded K-16 system .\nMost American students go to public institutions of higher education . What about the minority of students who go to private colleges and universities ? Wealthy private universities , like Yale and Harvard ( I went to the former , and have taught at the latter ) could afford free admission for everyone , not just the needy . If their greed leads them to continue to soak middle-class and upper-class students , at least the Ivies and other private universities can provide scholarships for low-income students . Private universities are tax-exempt institutions . They ought to act like charities , not hedge funds or for-profit conglomerates . So here ’ s an idea : Limit tax-exempt status to private universities with free tuition for all students . If schools want to charge tuition , let them be taxed as for-profit corporations .\nWe have now , in our thought experiment , blown up and burned down American health care policy , American retirement policy , and American higher education policy . We have then built , upon the smoldering ruins of present-day complexity , a new , simple , universal , purely national system that is the same for every citizen , rich and poor .\nIn health care , there is only universal , lifelong Medicare or lifelong Obamacare—a single federal program with portable benefits , the same for everybody , with no role for the states or private employers at all . Simple .\nIn retirement policy , there are only two universal federal programs : Social Security , and a simple , universal defined contribution private savings plan on top of it .\nIn higher ed policy , we now have two simple systems of free higher education . All public community colleges and state universities now offer free tuition , paid for by state taxes and federal grants . Tax-exempt private colleges and universities also offer free tuition , paid for out of their tax-favored endowments .\nFantasy ? In the short term , sure . The well-paid parasites who profit from complexity will see to that . But there are two kinds of politics : Moving the ball and moving the goal-posts . This is about moving the goal-posts . This is about the next generation , not the next election .\nRome was not built in a day , and the antiquated , crumbling , rat-infested fire hazard that is American public policy will not be condemned , demolished and replaced by a clean , modern , solid structure overnight . But the sooner we start the demolition , the better . In the meantime , “ Equal rights for all , special privileges for none ” would make a good campaign slogan in 2016 . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "246": "Since the publication of his attorney general ’ s short report on the outcome of the Mueller investigation , Donald Trump has looked like a president unleashed . He has attacked his enemies , demanded the resignation of journalists who he says peddled “ fake news ” , and advanced controversial policies on health and immigration . With a cloud over his presidency lifted , he is free to act like never before . Meanwhile , Democrats feel under pressure to move on to discussing other issues or risk looking like McCarthyite obsessives .\nSuch , anyway , is the conventional wisdom . But what if it is wrong ?\nWhen Trump is caught red-handed in a lie or scandal , he has a time-worn playbook for weathering it . First , he lies about the facts of the matter , attempting to create enough uncertainty to inoculate his base and a portion of the rest of the population against accepting the reality of what has happened . Second , he pivots to attacking his antagonists ( which in the past have included a dead senator , the father of a fallen soldier , and judges of Mexican heritage ) . Finally , he tries to change the subject .\nFar from Trump emerging into a new phase of his presidency with the release of the Barr report , he has in fact lapsed into this age-old pattern . Phases one and two came quickly , with Trump and his surrogates claiming that the president had been completely exonerated even though Mueller explicitly did not make this judgment . They then accused the media and Democrats of corruptly conspiring to bring down the president .\nBefore we can move on from the Mueller report , we need to know much more\nBut it is the next part of the administration ’ s response , phase three , which is so uniquely Trumpian . The president has frequently managed to survive scandals that might have felled other politicians because he is so adept at changing the conversation by sparking a new furor , which eclipses the old one . The result has been a presidency of serial scandals which can easily induce a sense of numbness in his opponents , while making himself appear invulnerable to any particular one of the hundreds of controversies encircling him .\nSince the release of the Barr report , Trump has attempted to change the topic in two ways . The first is on healthcare . Last Monday , the Trump administration filed a letter in a Texas court declaring that it would like to see the entirety of the Affordable Care Act – also known as Obamacare – declared unconstitutional . Backing a wacky legal challenge that has been levied against the ACA , the administration is advocating stripping healthcare benefits from tens of millions of Americans with no plan for how to provide them with alternative coverage . Although the move is a sure political loser for Republicans , Trump charged ahead anyway .\nSecond , Trump has stepped up his anti-immigrant rhetoric and threatened to close the US border with Mexico , another self-destructive move which would harm millions of Americans . Nearly $ 1.7bn in commerce flows over the border daily , and automakers and farmers – exactly the Americans who Trump claims to stand up for – would be most affected by the closure . It would also undermine cooperation with Mexico , which is necessary to handle the migrant crisis . For good measure , Trump announced last week that he would cut off aid to Central American countries that need it in order to stem the flow of refugees .\nCongress must investigate Trump . But it must also be strategic about it | Laurence H Tribe Read more\nSuch self-destructive measures on healthcare and immigration demonstrate that what Trump is really after is headlines , not solutions . The fact that the president is so keen to change the subject now ought to make Democrats think twice about the wisdom of going along with his wishes . Instead , they need to stay focused on obtaining a full copy of the Mueller report and making its contents known to the public .\nIn 2016 , the integrity of America ’ s electoral process was attacked by a foreign power . Since that time , the president and his allies have engaged in a sinister and baffling pattern of behavior designed to hide their own connections to that power . All we know so far is that Mueller was not able to prove that they criminally colluded with Russia , and that he was unable to exonerate the president of criminally obstructing the inquiry . Before we can move on , we need to know much more .\nThis is not about relitigating the 2016 election , as some Republicans claim . It is about establishing the principle that America has a president , not a king , and that the president is bound by the rule of law . It is about returning a bare modicum of accountability to American public life after years of congressional Republicans shirking their constitutional duty to hold the executive branch to account . It is about finding out exactly how American national security was compromised in 2016 , and why the president and his surrogates are so keen to pretend it wasn ’ t . Finally , it is about restoring faith in American government among the public , who polls show are waiting for the final conclusions of Mueller ’ s investigation before they believe that the president is exonerated .\nPerhaps that ’ s why Donald Trump won ’ t just release the report , and instead wants to change the subject . Democrats shouldn ’ t let him . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

Kirsten Gillibrand criticized Obama for failing to show leadership on the fight against military sex crimes , saying he didn ’ t live up to his December 2013 promise to force an overhaul of the Defense Department ’ s judicial system if it didn ’ t make progress within a year .\n“ A year has long passed and we haven ’ t seen the kind of changes that we need. ” Gillibrand said . “ I do not believe they are taking the issue as seriously as they should and they should not be resisting the professionalization of the military justice system . ”\nShe made these remarks after the Senate voted down an amendment she sponsored that would change the way sexual assault is prosecuted in the military , removing it from the military justice chain of command .\nGillibrand ’ s public , Democrat-vs-Democrat rebuke comes just days after Obama ’ s top ally and House democratic leader Nancy Pelosi delivered a stinging blow to the administration by voting against two related trade bills .\nPelosi had been seen as a silent ally to Obama and Republicans running the House in promoting Obama ’ s trade agenda , though she kept her position secret until the end of Friday ’ s debate , when she stunned observers by saying she would vote against the bills .\nPelosi said her opposition was to win a broader fight . “ Our people would rather have a job than trade assistance , ” she said , adding that that while she supported a bill to help workers who lost their job because of foreign trade , she opposed fast-track legislation — which would allow the president to negotiate trade deals with limited Congressional interference — which prevented her from supporting the bills in the House from going forward .\n“ I will be voting today to slow down the Fast Track , to get a better deal for the American people — bigger paychecks , better infrastructure , help the American people fulfill the American dream , ” she explained .\nAfter Pelosi ’ s bombshell , intra-party resistance to Obama ’ s trade efforts continued as Hilary Clinton , the Democratic front-runner in the 2016 presidential election , appeared to back the Democratic leader over President Obama .

    "248": "The special investigation into Russian election meddling has closed in dramatically on Donald Trump after news broke on Monday that a former foreign policy adviser pleaded guilty to perjury over his contacts with Russians linked to the Kremlin , and the president ’ s former campaign manager and another aide faced charges of money laundering .\nIn a day of rapid and surprising developments in Washington , George Papadopolous , the former foreign policy adviser , was revealed to have pleaded guilty earlier this month to lying to FBI investigators over his contacts last year with two people with apparently close ties to the Russian government .\nOne was an unnamed professor – identified by the Washington Post as Joseph Mifsud – who offered “ dirt ” on Hillary Clinton . Another was a woman who portrayed herself as “ Putin ’ s niece ” .\nQuick guide What you need to know about the Trump-Russia inquiry Show Hide How serious are the allegations ? The story of Donald Trump and Russia comes down to this : a sitting president or his campaign is suspected of having coordinated with a foreign country to manipulate a US election . The story could not be bigger , and the stakes for Trump – and the country – could not be higher . What are the key questions ? Investigators are asking two basic questions : did Trump ’ s presidential campaign collude at any level with Russian operatives to sway the 2016 US presidential election ? And did Trump or others break the law to throw investigators off the trail ? What does the country think ? While a majority of the American public now believes that Russia tried to disrupt the US election , opinions about Trump campaign involvement tend to split along partisan lines : 73 % of Republicans , but only 13 % of Democrats , believe Trump did “ nothing wrong ” in his dealings with Russia and its president , Vladimir Putin . What are the implications for Trump ? The affair has the potential to eject Trump from office . Experienced legal observers believe that prosecutors are investigating whether Trump committed an obstruction of justice . Both Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton – the only presidents to face impeachment proceedings in the last century – were accused of obstruction of justice . But Trump ’ s fate is probably up to the voters . Even if strong evidence of wrongdoing by him or his cohort emerged , a Republican congressional majority would probably block any action to remove him from office . ( Such an action would be a historical rarity . ) What has happened so far ? Former foreign policy adviser George Papadopolous pleaded guilty to perjury over his contacts with Russians linked to the Kremlin , and the president ’ s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and another aide face charges of money laundering . When will the inquiry come to an end ? The investigations have an open timeline .\nMeanwhile , in a federal courthouse in central Washington , Trump ’ s former campaign manager , Paul Manafort , and a business associate , Rick Gates , pleaded not guilty to an indictment for money laundering , tax evasion , failure to register as agents for foreign interests and conspiracy to defraud the US government .\nA federal judge ordered Manafort and Gates to be confined at home and set bail at $ 10m for Manafort and $ 5m for Gates .\nThe indictments were the first issued by Robert Mueller since he was appointed special counsel in May , with broad powers to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion by members of the Trump campaign .\nAfter the indictment of Manafort and Gates was revealed on Monday morning , Trump tweeted : “ Sorry , but this is years ago , before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign . But why aren ’ t Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus ? ? ? ? ? ”\nLater , the White House press secretary , Sarah Huckabee Sanders , played down the connection between the three men and the Trump campaign . She said of Manafort and Gates ’ s indictment : “ Today ’ s announcement has nothing to do with the president , presidential campaigns or any campaign activity . ”\nManafort joined the Trump campaign in March 2016 as convention manager , focusing on winning delegates at the 2016 Republican convention , and was promoted to campaign manager in June 2016 before resigning in August over his links to Ukraine .\nSanders said : “ Paul Manafort was brought in to lead the delegate process , which he did , and was dismissed not too long after that . ”\nShe also insisted Papadopoulos ’ s lies to the FBI about his contacts with Russia on behalf of the Trump campaign had “ nothing to do with the activities of the campaign ” , and repeatedly dismissed Papadopoulos as “ a volunteer member on an advisory council ” .\nPlay Video 0:44 White House : No sign of collusion in campaign aides ' indictments – video\nHowever , Trump himself had announced Papadopoulos ’ s appointment as a foreign policy adviser in March 2016 , describing him as “ an excellent guy ” . The charges , which Papadopoulos accepted as accurate as part of a guilty plea on 5 October , said Trump was present at a meeting of national security advisers where Papadopoulos boasted of his Russian connections and said he could help organise a meeting with Putin .\nThe charges state that the unnamed woman he was in contact with was not related to the Russian president . But Papadopoulos ’ s links with her and the professor led to extensive contacts with Russian officials regarding a Putin-Trump meeting and other high-level exchanges .\nThe professor referred to in the charges against Papadopoulos is said to have told him that the Russians had “ dirt ” on Clinton in the form of “ thousands of emails ” at a meeting around 26 April 2016 , months before the Russian hack of Democratic party emails became publicly known .\nA prosecutor representing Mueller ’ s office , Aaron Zelinsky , said at the October hearing that the Papadopoulos case was just a “ small part ” of “ a large scale ongoing investigation ” , according to a transcript of the court session , adding weight to anticipation that Monday ’ s charges are the tip of an iceberg .\nCollusion itself is not a crime , unless it rises to the level of espionage or treason . Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to making false statements to FBI agents about the extent and timing of his contacts with Russians , and about his awareness of their links to the Kremlin .\nPapadopoulos was arrested in July at Dulles airport when he returned from a trip abroad . The court papers note that he subsequently “ met with the government on numerous occasions to provide information and answer questions ” . He was charged more than two months later .\nSummarising the day ’ s developments , Susan Hennessey and Benjamin Wittes , editors of the Lawfare blog , wrote : “ President Trump , in short , had on his campaign at least one person , and allegedly two people , who actively worked with adversarial foreign governments in a fashion they sought to criminally conceal from investigators . ”\nUltimately , the question over whether Trump committed “ high crimes and misdemeanours ” through his camp ’ s contacts with Moscow during the election will be decided by Congress , where Republicans control both chambers .\nMark Warner , the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee , said after the charges were made public : “ This is just the latest in a series of undisclosed contacts , misleading public statements , potentially compromising information and highly questionable actions from the time of the Trump campaign that together remain a cause for deep concern and continued investigation . ”\nManafort and Gates pleaded not guilty to 12 charges . The first was “ conspiracy against the United States ” , an overall charge that refers specifically to the failure to inform the government of foreign income and foreign bank accounts , and failing to register lobbying work for foreign interests .\nManafort 's 'lavish lifestyle ' laundered illicit cash through property loans – and Airbnb Read more\nThe indictment focuses on the business activities of the two men before Manafort joined Trump ’ s campaign , in March 2016 , and Gates became a senior fundraiser .\nThe charges allege the two men worked extensively for political figures and parties in Ukraine and laundered millions of dollars in payment for that work by channelling it through a web of companies , mostly in the US and Cyprus . They are accused of constructing elaborate schemes to hide their earnings from the US government , and failing to register the foreign interests for which they were lobbying .\nThe indictment alleges $ 75m in payments flowed through offshore accounts , of which Manafort laundered more than $ 18m to buy property , goods and services in the US , hiding the income from the government . It says Gates transferred $ 3m from the offshore accounts to other accounts he controlled .\n“ In order to hide Ukraine payments from United States authorities , from approximately 2006 to at least 2016 , Manafort and Gates laundered the money through scores of United States and foreign corporations , partnerships and bank accounts , ” the indictment claims .\nIt notes that Manafort used “ his hidden overseas wealth to fund a lavish lifestyle , without paying taxes on that income ” .\nThe charges were approved by a grand jury on Friday . Although the indictment says the two men ’ s moneymaking activities lasted until at least 2016 , the charges do not mention the role of the two men in the Trump campaign .\nAn attorney for Manafort , Kevin Downing , said there was no evidence the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government .\n“ Mr Manafort represented pro-European Union campaigns for the Ukrainians and in the course of that representation he was seeking to further democracy and to help the Ukrainians come closer to the United States and to the EU , ” Downing said in a statement . “ Those activities ended in 2014 , two years before Mr Manafort served in the Trump Campaign . ”\nTrump ’ s lawyer , Ty Cobb , told ███ there was “ no angst at the White House ” . Manafort had been warned to expect an indictment and Cobb recently told the New York Times he was confident the former Trump campaign chair had no damaging information on the president to offer in exchange for leniency .\nHowever , the Mueller investigation is widely expected to produce further indictments and many legal observers had predicted it would start with charges related to financial crimes as a way of pressuring defendants to provide more information on the Trump team ’ s relationship with Moscow .\nRussia inquiry charges : how close does this get to Trump ? Read more\n“ The amount of money that Manafort received is staggering , ” said Scott Horton , a US expert on international law with extensive experience of financial cases and eastern Europe . “ The Russian/Ukrainian side is complicit in its routing and obscuring the fact of payment .\n“ That ’ s significant because it means they had knowledge of serious criminal acts by Manafort which they could hold over his head and use to force him to do their bidding . The suspicion would naturally be that they were a driving force behind his volunteering to serve the Trump campaign for free . ” \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "249": "Last week , I had the opportunity to participate in local protests in Madison , Wisconsin , over the killing of Tony Robinson , a 19-year-old unarmed Black teenager killed by a police officer . It was an unusually warm early March day in the city , which encouraged several hundred people and many media outlets to show up for the protests . Despite my fatigue at yet another killing of an unarmed Black youth , I took heart in the sincere rage and unapologetic stance of the people . Their presence at the protests proved wrong all those naysayers who hoped that the burning embers of the Black Lives Matter movement would be extinguished in the harsh cold of winter .\nIndeed this movement has its fair share of skeptics , including Black folks quick to declare the movement dead on arrival . When I listen to these people , I can never quite detect whether they are being descriptive or prescriptive , but frequently I ’ m convinced it ’ s the latter .\nThere is also a more insidious kind of participant in the movement , the moderate Black folks , the Respectables , I call them , who still believe that our energies should be spent demonstrating to white people that Black people can be self-critical . One such person is Jonathan Capehart . In a recent column for the Washington Post , Capehart argues , on the heels of the release of the official Department of Justice report on the shooting of Michael Brown , that Brown is an “ inappropriate symbol ” for this new , burgeoning movement . The DOJ report does ultimately back Wilson ’ s recounting of events , that Brown reached into his car , punched him , tried to take his gun , ran after being shot , and then turned around and came forward . Thus Capehart concludes that :\n“ now that black lives matter to everyone it is imperative that we continue marching for and giving voice to those killed in racially charged incidents at the hands of police and others . But we must never allow ourselves to march under the banner of a false narrative on behalf of someone who would otherwise offend our sense of right and wrong . And when we discover that we have , we must acknowledge it , admit our error , and keep on marching . ”\nI get Capehart ’ s play . He ostensibly believes in the rightness of the Black Lives Matter movement , and he hopes that if as a Black person , he acknowledges that “ we ” were wrong in our assumptions about Mike Brown ’ s innocence , then he , and by extension “ we , ” will retain the moral high ground upon which the movement is built . Our claims will be more credible to “ reasonable ” white people , who want to believe us , but can ’ t because of their innate disposition toward believing that nothing is racist , unless the N-word is used .\nModerate Black people – Barack Obama included – continue to believe that the way to bring white people into the anti-racist fold is by conceding some ground in order to gain more ground . It ’ s an old debate tactic , but it only works if everyone plays fair . There are two problems with this . First , those with racial privilege generally don ’ t play fair in racial discussions . More than that , they play downright dirty , denying the persistence of racism , trotting out erroneous statistics , blaming Black behavior for white racism . The Ferguson Police Department , for example , has conceded nothing even after being found guilty of decades of egregious , consistent and systematic violations of the rights of Ferguson ’ s Black citizens . Second , Capehart implicitly concedes that it is Black people who must prove that incidents are racially inflected , rather than white people who must prove that they are not . Since we now know for a fact that Darren Wilson policed in a racially hostile city and police department , and since Ferguson residents – Michael Brown included – knew that long before a Justice Department report merely affirmed their experience , it is perfectly reasonable for Black folks to view Ferguson police and police around the country with suspicion . And it is reasonable for Black folks to want clear evidence that this incident was not racial . The DOJ ’ s own report foregoes such conclusions .\nMoreover , though I am absolutely fatigued in my relitigation of the events of Aug. 9 , I do want to point to two statements in the DOJ report on the killing of Brown , that Capehart glosses over in his attempt to be undeservedly magnanimous to Darren Wilson . First , the report states that though Wilson , knowing of the incident with the Cigarillos at the convenience store , suspected Brown and his friend Dorian Johnson of the petty crime , when he initially saw them , he told them to “ walk on the sidewalk . ”\nThey refused . Having visited Canfield Drive , and seeing the narrowness of the street , I can attest that such a request would have seemed ridiculous and unnecessarily harassing . Coupled with the generally hostile context in which the FPD polices , the resistance from the two teen boys makes sense . Wilson did not approach them and say he wanted to question them about a crime at a convenience store . He approached them and told them to “ walk on the sidewalk , ” according to the DOJ , or “ get the fuck up on the sidewalk , ” according to Michael Brown ’ s friend .\nThen the report says that Wilson parked his car at an angle to keep the two young men from walking any further . “ Wilson attempted to open the driver ’ s door of the SUV to exit his vehicle , but as he swung it open , the door came into contact with Brown ’ s body and either rebounded closed or Brown pushed it closed . ”\nThen the altercation where Brown allegedly reached into Wilson ’ s vehicle happened . Now let us lay that aside for a moment , to consider that during this entire time , Wilson has not let these young men know what his business is with them . He rolled up on them and demanded that they get on the sidewalk in a small apartment complex . Beyond that point , the report remains inconclusive on the question of the door making initial contact with Brown ’ s body . His friend said the officer slammed the door into Brown ’ s body , while Wilson says the door either rebounded closed or Brown pushed the door closed .\nThis is not insignificant . If these boys perceived this officer as harassing them about the sidewalk and then slamming a door into Brown ’ s body , then certainly Brown may have reacted aggressively .\nI do not know , and won ’ t further speculate . I will say , however , that Wilson receives the benefit of the doubt even though he works for a corrupt police department with a hostile relationship to the community . Are police always worthy of the benefit of the doubt ? Are young Black men ever deemed worthy of the benefit of the doubt ?\nMoreover , there are the pure shenanigans that took place in the grand jury in which the prosecutor used an out-of-date and unconstitutional statute about an officer ’ s right to shoot a fleeing suspect in his statements to the grand jury . One of those grand jurors later sued because of blatant irregularities in the legal procedure .\nBut none of this matters in determining Mike Brown ’ s appropriateness for movement work .\nFirst , Brown does n't have to be a perfect victim to be deserving of a place in movement history . The Department of Justice would never have investigated the Ferguson Police without Brown being killed and the people rising up in protest .\nSecond , even if , for the sake of argument , I concede that Brown did everything Wilson said he did ( and I ’ m not conceding any of this , mind you ) , we must ask why we are outraged at these two young men for not respecting the rule of law in a city where a corrupt police force has exploited and abused its Black residents for decades . Those who take an oath to uphold the law and protect citizens surely are held to a higher standard than two teen boys engaged in youthful mischief .\nThree , there is no scenario in which a teenager or any other person should be dead for stealing cigarillos and not walking on the sidewalk . Period . The Black Lives Matter movement is asking us at base level to reject many of the assumptions that undergird our current thinking about how policing takes place in Black and Brown communities . Why are the police trained to shoot-to-kill rather than to shoot to disarm ? Why do police use authority and weapons to escalate situations rather than deescalate them ? And why , then , are Black men the most frequent casualties of these severe police tactics ?\nThese are not the kinds of questions that can be asked when the victim is a perfect victim .\nWhat , then , is to be gained by arguing that Wilson was justified for shooting a kid who allegedly took some cigarillos ? To me , this killing is evidence at best of a piss-poor policing structure .\nMoreover , while some witnesses may have been mistaken , all of them were not . Just because Brown had no bullet wounds in his back , does not mean Wilson did not shoot at him as he ran away . The bullet wounds in his forearms very easily could have entered his body while he was running away . The report remains inconclusive on this point , and it is a major point . The report is also inconclusive about whether Brown was in fact charging Wilson . It concludes only that Brown was “ coming towards Wilson . ”\nMichael Brown remains an appropriate symbol of this movement . For one , his acts of resistance and refusal – and I do see them as such – pointed us to a city that balances its budget on the backs of poor Black residents . The police merely act as thuggish enforcers for the racket that constitutes city government .\nBeyond that , this movement , before it is all said and done , will force all of us to grow up and stop believing in the myth of our own purity . We must stop believing that our lives only have value , that they are only worthy of protection , when we ’ ve done everything right . Even though I am no believer in capital punishment , we do have an understanding in this country that capital punishment is reserved for capital crimes .\nIf Michael and Dorian were two white teenagers , it would be easier for us to look at the adult and the person with more power in this situation – Darren Wilson – and hold him responsible for escalating a conflict and devastating a community over a pack of cigarettes .\nIn his desire to placate white folks and appear reasonable , Jonathan Capehart lets Wilson off the hook . The implication of Capehart ’ s argument is that Michael Brown is an acceptable , justifiable casualty in this decades-long police war on a small Midwestern community . But if you believe that All Black lives matter , that is an unconscionable conclusion , one that “ offends my sense of right and wrong. ” As “ respectable ” Blacks are wont to do , the Capeharts of the world need to believe that if Black people would just “ act right ” and “ do right , ” we would be all right . But in a system of white supremacy , there isn ’ t that much act right in the world .\nJonathan , surely you know a suit and tie won ’ t protect you . So we ’ re going to keep on marching , as you said . And we will keep holding aloft the banner of Michael Brown . We will do so , because Black folks have already tested out your theory of respectability . We ’ ve been trying to save our lives by dressing right , talking right and never , ever fucking up since about 1877 . That shit has not worked .\nIn an ideal world of crime and punishment , the officer would have had the legal leeway and good sense to pick these boys up , take them back down to the convenience store , make them apologize and work out an arrangement to work off the cigarillos they stole . That is one example of restorative justice and of the world we are fighting for . We are trying to get free , and that means we bring everybody with us , whether your suit is tailored or your pants sag . When the revolution comes , we will leave no one behind . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "250": "House Speaker John Boehner is about to begin another attempt at a grand bargain deficit reduction deal with President Obama , a high wire act in which he will be buffeted by demands from the White House as well as from House Republicans .\nThe difficulty of keeping in step with the hard line approach of his fellow Republicans has been on view since the presidential election .\nOn Thursday , Boehner told ███ ' Diane Sawyer that repealing Obamacare was no longer his party 's most pressing concern , saying , `` Obamacare is the law of the land '' and the election settled the dispute over repeal .\nShortly after his comment was aired , Boehner put out a tweet saying , `` ObamaCare is law of the land , but it is raising costs & threatening jobs . Our goal has been , and will remain , # fullrepeal . ''\nDuring that interview , the Speaker also told Sawyer that comprehensive immigration reform is a top priority in his legislative agenda during the next Congress . Republicans within his conference , like Rep. John Fleming , were livid .\n`` I 'm concerned that Speaker Boehner is getting ahead of House Republicans when he commits to getting a 'comprehensive approach ' to immigration taken care of 'once and for all . ' There 's been zero discussion of this issue within the conference , and I 'm urging the Speaker to talk with House Republicans before making pledges on the national news , '' Fleming , R-La. , blasted in a statement . `` The Speaker needs to pull back on this issue and stop negotiating in public . ''\nAnd when Boehner tried last year to negotiate a grand bargain with Obama on the deficit , taxes and entitlements , key members of his party revolted at the notion that Boehner was open to new revenues .\nIn one of his last news conferences before the election , the Speaker said his failure to strike a grand bargain with the president was `` the biggest disappointment of my speakership . ''\nObama said Friday that new discussions will begin next week when Congress returns to begin the lame duck session .\nBoehner , who held a news conference Friday shortly before Obama , was cautious in his comments and offered few details on what he would accept in a deal , other than rejecting the suggestion of raising taxes on the top tier of tax payers .\nInstead , he said , `` This is an opportunity for the president to lead . This is his moment to engage the Congress and work towards a solution that can pass both chambers . ''\nWhen pressed on what was the size of deficit reduction package he envisioned , the speaker reiterated that he does not want to limit the scope of negotiations and once again called for Obama to lead .\n`` I do n't want to box myself in . I do n't want to box anybody else in , '' Boehner said .\n`` I do n't want to limit the options that would be available to me or limit the options that might be available to the White House , '' he said . `` There are a lot of ways to get there , and I do n't really want to preclude anyone who might have a good idea about how we move forward . ''\nBoehner 's immigration comment was also raised at his news conference Friday , but he was non-committal when asked if he was endorsing a pathway to citizenship .\n`` I 'm not talking about a 3,000-page bill , '' he said . `` What I 'm talking about is a common-sense , step-by-step approach that would secure our borders , allow us to enforce the laws and fix a broken immigration system , '' he said . `` I 'm not going to get into any of the details of how you would get there .

    "252": "Obama Elevates 'Low-Key ' Lew to Treasury Post Outgoing Treasury Secretary Geithner hailed as one of `` finest '' in history .\nWASHINGTON , Jan. 10 , 2013 -- Facing a brewing fight over the debt ceiling and spending cuts , President Obama today tapped his chief of staff , Jack Lew , to be the next Treasury secretary , elevating a close confidante and trusted adviser to the leading economic voice for the administration 's second term .\nAt a midday news conference , Obama praised Lew , 57 , as a `` low-key guy who prefers to surround himself with policy experts rather than television cameras '' and hailed his reputation as `` a master of policy who can work with members of both parties and forge principled compromises . ''\nThe nod to Lew 's political experience , as a former congressional staffer and Clinton administration budget director , highlights the political battles on the horizon in three new `` fiscal cliffs '' : the debt ceiling , looming automatic spending cuts and a measure to fund the government for the coming year .\n`` As the son of a Polish immigrant , a man of deep and devout faith , Jack knows that every number on a page , every dollar we budget , every decision we make has to be an expression of who we wish to be as a nation , our values , the values that say everybody gets a fair shot at opportunity , '' Obama said .\nIf confirmed by the Senate , Lew will replace outgoing Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner , the longest-serving member of Obama 's economic team .\n`` When the history books are written , Tim Geithner is going to go down as one of our finest secretaries of the Treasury , '' Obama said , noting that the Treasury secretary helped craft the administration 's response to the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 , the worst since the Great Depression .\n`` With the wreckage of our economy still smoldering and unstable , I asked him to help put it back together . And thanks in large part to his steady hand , our economy has been growing again for the past three years , '' Obama said .\nGeithner is expected to remain at his post until Jan. 25 . He is then believed to be returning to work in the private sector .\nAs chief of staff for the past year , Lew has been intimately involved in the negotiations with Congress on the debt ceiling , averting a government shutdown last summer and the so-called fiscal cliff earlier this month .\nA key factor in the president 's decision was also Lew 's ability to get right to work on the first crises ahead , having already forged relationships within the administration and across the economic team .\nLew 's experience as Bill Clinton 's budget director , when he helped craft a bi-partisan budget agreement that led to three years of budget surpluses , was also critical , Obama said .\nLew also has private-sector experience .

    "253": "Forty-five years ago next month a White House conversation took place that will be remembered by history as the one containing the infamous `` 18-minute gap . '' That was the day after the Watergate break-in , when 18 and a half minutes of a recorded conversation between former President Richard Nixon and his top lieutenant H.R . Haldeman were mysteriously erased from a tape . It was apparently the first time they discussed the event and quite likely when they began to plan the ensuing coverup .\nMany events pertaining to that crime were revealed over the course of the following two years , the story unfolding in fits and starts , but that gap remains one of the most memorable and mysterious of the details that finally led to the resignation of Nixon in August 1974 .\nWatergate history buffs undoubtedly heard the echoes of that famous occasion on Monday , when they heard the news media 's repeated references to an `` 18-day gap '' related to testimony by the former director of national intelligence , James Clapper , and former acting Attorney General Sally Yates before the Senate Judiciary Committee 's Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism . That 's the length of time it took from the day Yates informed the White House that its national security adviser , Michael Flynn , had possibly been compromised by the Russian government to the day when President Donald Trump finally fired him .\nThe story is pretty straightforward . Yates met with White House counsel Don McGahn on Jan. 26 and 27 and had one follow-up phone call to inform the administration of the Department of Justice 's concerns about Flynn . The Washington Post reported in February that McGahn then `` immediately '' briefed Trump on the matter . Nonetheless , Flynn participated in an hourlong phone call with Russia 's President Vladimir Putin on Jan. 28 , for which the official readout was brief and uninformative .\nYates was fired two days later , on Jan. 30 , ostensibly for her statement that she did not intend to enforce Trump 's hastily thrown together travel ban . Flynn , however , remained at his post for two more weeks , attending high-level meetings and listening in on calls with other foreign leaders . He was only let go after The Washington Post published a story that Flynn had discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador during the transition period before Trump assumed office and allowed Vice President Pence to lie to the American people about it . The fact that Trump knew about this and also allowed Pence to continue to lie about it has never been adequately explained . As far as I know , he has n't even been asked about it .\nYates ' appearance on Monday did n't break any big news as she was unable to reveal any classified details in public . But it did clarify what motivated the Justice Department officials to take the steps they took . They were concerned because Flynn was lying and the Russians knew he was lying , so he had opened himself up to blackmail . As Yates pithily put it in her testimony :\nTo state the obvious , you do n't want your national security adviser compromised with the Russians .\nShe is right . But that would assume that the only person who had been compromised was the national security adviser . Sen. Al Franken had some thoughts in that regard :\nIs it possible that the reason that he didn ’ t fire him then was that , well , if I fire him for talking to the Russians about sanctions , what about all the other people on my team who coordinated ? . . . That may be why it took him 18 days — until it came public — to get rid of Mike Flynn , who was a danger to this republic .\nWe have learned since Flynn 's ouster that Trump 's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner also had meetings with the Russian ambassador and Russian bankers . And we know there is an ongoing multiagency counterintelligence investigation of possible collusion by the Trump campaign with the Russian government , involving other Trump advisers and campaign staff . Franken could be right .\nIt 's impossible to know what was in Trump 's head so it also could be that he just liked Flynn and did n't understand why this information was important . But Yates ' testimony hinted at something more about those contacts that are classified . She told the committee that she told McGahn that Flynn 's `` underlying contact was problematic in and of itself , '' which implies that it was n't just the fact that he did it and lied about it . The suggestion is that Flynn said or did something in those contacts that would have been compromising .\nIn Trump 's overwrought Feb. 16 press conference , when he announced the firing of Flynn , the president said , `` When I looked at the information , I said , I do n't think he did anything wrong . If anything , he did something right . '' He went on to explain that it was Flynn 's giving incorrect information to Pence that was the problem . Clearly , Trump saw no problem with Flynn 's `` underlying contact , '' which would seem to be relevant to the larger investigation about possible coordination .\nThe Republicans on the committee behaved like the worst partisan hacks , for the most part refusing to even address the subject of the hearing and instead grilling Yates on the Muslim ban and ranting about `` unmasking '' procedures and leaks to the press , obviously following the White House line . Sen. Ted Cruz even asked Yates about Hillary Clinton 's emails . Most of the Republicans on the committee did n't even bother to stay for the whole hearing .\nYates ' answers about the Muslim ban were devastating to committee Republicans ' cause and the rest of the yammering about leaks sounds particularly hollow when you consider the timeline that I just outlined above . It 's quite clear that if nobody had leaked the information on Flynn to The Washington Post , an obviously unbalanced and possibly compromised man would still be the president 's national security adviser .\nMeanwhile , Trump behaved the way he normally does in tight situations . He attempted to smear Yates as the leaker in one of his notorious early-morning tweets . It was later deleted , probably after someone mustered the courage to tell him that he was threatening a witness , a move he probably learned during his days in the gambling business in Atlantic City .\nMeanwhile , according to Axios , Trump has told his people to stop feeding negative stories about Flynn to the media . The official explanation is that Trump believes that Flynn is a good man , that the Russia story is `` fake news '' and whatever went wrong was Obama 's fault . But one can not help but wonder if Trump 's lawyers might have reminded him that Flynn is shopping for an immunity deal and treating him disrespectfully might just loosen his tongue about things the president might not want him to say . Trump probably learned about that sort of thing from certain Atlantic City business associates , too . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "254": "Coronavirus threatens the world ’ s economic life , and current proposals from governments around the globe are failing to match the scale of the crisis . Today , the chancellor , Rishi Sunak , announced £330bn of loans and that some companies would not have to pay business rates for the next 12 months . While loans help businesses in the short term , they do not compensate for losses and only allow companies to smooth costs over a longer period .\nWorkers should immediately start receiving special unemployment benefits so they are no longer a cost to their employers\nIn the US , the Trump administration has suggested direct cash payments to individuals . Such measures ( such as $ 1,000 given to each US household ) help to alleviate temporary economic hardship but are poorly targeted : it ’ s too little for those who lose their jobs , and it is not needed by those who don ’ t . During social distancing , the goal should not be to increase demand , since people can no longer spend on many goods and services .\nUnemployment insurance , or benefits , and paid sick leave policies come closest to helping laid off workers and those unable to work , but they do not prevent redundancies and do not help businesses . Tax relief , such as the business rate holiday offered by the UK to sectors most affected by the recession , such as hospitality and retail , will help . But there ’ s no guarantee this relief will be enough to prevent bankruptcies and job losses .\nThere is , however , a radical and targeted solution to the specific causes of the coronavirus global recession : governments should step in as payers of last resort , which means they would cover wage and maintenance costs for businesses facing shutdown . In the context of this pandemic , we need a new form of social insurance , one that directly helps both workers and businesses .\nSo , how does this work in practice ? The drop in demand caused by social distancing measures , and a following decrease in output and therefore GDP , is expected to be short , probably for a few months . Governments can not undo this direct output loss , but they can prevent a very sharp but short recession becoming a long-lasting depression .\nAbsent government actions , and many businesses and workers do not have enough liquidity to weather dramatic shortfalls in demand causing mass redundancies . Keeping businesses alive through this crisis and making sure workers continue to receive their wages is essential .\nThe most direct way to provide this insurance is to have governments act as payers of last resort , so that hibernating businesses can keep paying their workers ( known in economic terms as idle workers ) instead of laying them off , and can keep paying their necessary bills such as rent , utilities and interest instead of going bankrupt .\nIn practice , in the US , the unemployment insurance system is already up and running , making it possible to compute and deliver compensation to idle workers . Workers should immediately start receiving special unemployment insurance benefits so they are no longer a cost to their employers – even though they stay formally employed – and no re-hiring process is needed once they can come back to work .\nSelf-employed individuals ( such as gig workers ) could report themselves as idle and be eligible for this special unemployment insurance . In case of partial idling – if someone ’ s working hours have been cut – unemployment insurance benefits would be prorated .\nThese benefits would be progressive if they replaced a higher fraction of earnings for low-paid workers . This is a desirable feature , as low-paid workers are more likely to be affected by the lockdown ( ie less likely to be able to work from home ) and less likely to have savings to replace a temporary loss in earnings .\nIn the payer-of-last-resort programme we envision , businesses on lockdown would report their monthly necessary costs of maintenance and receive payment from the government . Necessary costs are rent , utility payments , interest on debt , health insurance ( in the US ) and national insurance contributions ( in the UK ) of idle workers , and other costs that are vital for the maintenance of businesses . For partially shut down sectors , governments would pay a fraction of the maintenance costs . The amounts don ’ t need to be exact ; verification and correction can take place once the lockdown is over . Any excess government payment could be transformed into an interest-free loan that could be recouped over several years .\nThere are two reasons why such a policy would work in the case of the coronavirus pandemic . First , it is clear what is driving the shock : a health crisis that has nothing to do with any business ’ s decision and will be temporary . Second , different industries are affected differently . That ’ s in contrast to normal recessions , where the drop in demand is widely spread and has no clear timeline .\nHow much would such a payer-of-last-resort programme cost ? Based on national account statistics by industry , we estimate that with a nationwide lockdown up to 30 % of aggregate demand could evaporate in the US over the next three months , leading to a 7.5 % drop in annual GDP .\nTear up the economic rule book . This pandemic calls for radical intervention | Ed Miliband Read more\nCompensating idle workers and necessary business maintenance costs would involve government payments of around half of this total . Unemployment insurance replaces about 50-60 % of wages , and essential maintenance costs of businesses are probably less than half of their normal operating costs ( for example , non-flying planes do not burn fuel ) . The total cost for the government would be around 3.75 % points of GDP , financed via an increase in public debt . The direct output loss from social distancing measures would in effect be put on the government ’ s tab , ie socialised . A payer-of-last-resort programme will work if it is limited in time ( eg three months ) , so the cost remains manageable and business decisions are not affected .\nIt would not fully offset the economic cost of coronavirus . No matter what governments do , there will be real output losses . Even if airline workers are paid , the plane rides won ’ t happen . For other sectors , supply-chain distortions will happen no matter what , due , for example , to quarantine measures .\nBut a payer-of-last-resort programme would alleviate the hardship on workers and businesses . It would maintain the cash flow for families and businesses so the coronavirus shock has no secondary impacts on demand – such as laid-off workers cutting down on consumption – and a quick rebound can take place once demand comes back . Business activity is on hold today , but with an intravenous cash flow it can be kept alive until the health crisis is over .\n• Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman are economics professors at the University of California , Berkeley \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "255": "As Donald Trump leads a full-scale war against the Republican establishment and elites , particularly through his attack on both their military ( Iraq ) and their trade ( NAFTA ) policies , the Democratic Party is also in a predicament that Bernie Sanders ’ candidacy is exposing . Both parties right now face a great crisis of leadership/ideology as well as a great opportunity for reinvention , and whichever party first reinvents itself successfully will begin winning elections the way the Democrats did in the 1932-1968 era .\nIf neither does , our nation faces a massive crisis provoked by the loss of democratic representation of the majority of the American electorate . Neither party today does much of anything for the bottom 90 % of Americans , as so clearly demonstrated by a recent study out of Princeton that showed that the likelihood of legislation passing that represents the interest of that bottom 90 % was equivalent , statistically , to white noise .\nThomas Frank ’ s new book Listen , Liberal : Or , Whatever Happened to the Party of the People ? offers the fascinating premise that starting with the McGovern Commission of 1972 ( which largely excommunicated Labor from having a large role in Democratic Party decision-making ) and going into a full-out embrace of the “ professional class ” – i.e . the top 10 % economically – the Democratic Party has largely abandoned the American working and middle class – the bottom 90 % .\nAs Frank told me on my program recently , the doctor who delivered me in 1951 was almost certainly a Republican ( then the party of the professional class ) , but today would almost certainly be a Democrat . In the 1950s and 1960s virtually the entire professional class ( the top 10 % ) was Republican ; today it ’ s virtually all Democratic .\nIn the late 1980s , the DLC Democrats ( and now the Third Way/Clinton Democrats ) embraced the professional class and embraced complex solutions to our nation ’ s problems . They consciously moved away from labor/working class and towards an elitist embrace of banksters , the emerging “ geniuses ” of Silicon Valley , and the college-educated at all levels .\nThey even went so far as to suggest it was a good thing that much of America ’ s blue-collar working-class high-school-diploma jobs go to China and Mexico , as we here in America needed to move to the “ new economy ” jobs of technology , medicine , and finance , requiring a college education .\nThis ideological change in the Party led to the Clinton-era 1990s policies that gutted our industrial base , ripped apart the social safety net ( ending “ the era of big government ” ) , and financialized our economy .\nAs Frank points out , while FDR had a “ brain trust ” of the best and the brightest in the nation , they were drawn from a broad cross-section of America in terms of class and education . Many didn ’ t even have a college education . The Clinton and Obama administrations , on the other hand , while optically more racially diverse , are almost entirely run by people with elite educations from elite universities ( particularly Harvard ) , who share the worldview of the DLC/Third Way .\nThe policies that came out of this new Democratic Party ideology ( largely taken from the 1950s Republicans ) have resulted in a boon for the professional class , but almost totally left behind the bottom 90 % .\nPresident Obama ’ s failure to even bring up Card Check ( the Employee Free Choice Act , which would have strengthened Labor ) , even after campaigning on it twice , is one of the most obvious examples of the Party ’ s decision to give lip service to working people , but keep their emphasis on elite complexity and the professional class that embodies it .\nThe result of these decisions and policies provided the opening for the most unlikely phenomenon ( on the Democratic side ) of my lifetime : a rumpled , acerbic , 74-year-old Jew with a Brooklyn accent who calls himself a “ Democratic Socialist ” drawing tens of thousands to stadiums across the nation and holding his own against the anointed candidate of the Democratic Party and Third Way elders .\nBernie Sanders carries into the Democratic Party the message of the bottom 90 % , the Occupy Movement , and the Black Lives Matter movement – and the aspirations of students and working people – so successfully in large part because they ’ ve been abandoned by the Democratic Party elites ( including the Clinton dynasty ) .\nWhile Thomas Frank details brilliantly the reinvention ( and , probably , destruction ) of the modern Democratic Party , in my book The Crash of 2016 , I detail the parallel rise of the modern Republican Party , starting with the Powell Memo within a year of the McGovern Commission .\nPrior to the 1970s , business in America had been largely apolitical , preferring to focus instead on making money and running companies . But Powell convinced the Chamber of Commerce and a group of wealthy ideologues to change all that , and a group of billionaires and foundations rose to the call and created the huge and well-funded “ conservative ” infrastructure of think-tanks , media arms ( hate radio and Fox News ) , and the Koch Network .\nWithin a generation , the Party elites relied almost entirely on Big Business and Big Money to get elected , only throwing rhetorical bones to the bottom 90 % with their cynical “ god , guns , and gays ” strategy .\nThe result of those Republican decisions and policies ( many also embraced by the DLC/Third Way Democrats as well ) brought us the Gingrich-congress-pushed Phil Gramm-deregulation ( signed by Bill Clinton but opposed by most congressional Democrats ) that crashed the world economy ( and threatens to do it again any day now ) ; changes in tax and trade laws that let the rich get fabulously richer but flat-lined wages of blue-collar workers for two generations ; and an open revolt among Republicans in the form of the Tea Party and the Trump candidacy .\nWith both political parties captured almost entirely by the interest of the top 1 % ( Republicans ) and the top 10 % ( Democrats ) , the bottom 90 % feel they have nowhere else to go . For the past few decades , they ’ ve expressed this reality of being unrepresented by simply not voting and not showing up for politics , which they correctly saw as rigged and not working in their interest .\nNow , with both Trump and Sanders exposing complex trade deals as unwieldy and destructive to the bottom 90 % ( but very useful and enriching to the top 10 % ) , as well as the politically corrupt environment that supports the top 10 % , people on the right and the left are waking up .\nInterestingly , since the ( Democratic ) professional class includes elite-publication and TV journalists , they largely write off Sanders as an anachronism , a throwback to the FDR era which , they believe , was a nice and quaint memory but ain ’ t how the world works any more in this “ globalized economy . ”\nAs a result , they don ’ t cover the Sanders candidacy , except when Bernie supporters decide to show up at Trump rallies and start a confrontation that reaches the level of spectacle that they think qualifies it as “ news . ”\nSimilarly , as CBS chief executive Les Mooves so candidly pointed out at a recent stockholders meeting ( revealed to the world by the brilliant reporting of Lee Fang over at The Intercept ) , the most senior management of the big networks are more than happy to give almost $ 2 billion in free media to Republican Donald Trump because , as Mooves said , “ It may not be good for America , but it ’ s damn good for CBS… ”\nThus , whichever party embraces the 90 % will probably win the 2016 election .\nIf that ’ s Trump and/or Sanders , it ’ ll either splinter the Republican and/or Democratic Party or may reinvent that party in a way that it can begin to build and hold multigenerational national political power .\nIf Trump is the Republican nominee , he could well win as a change-candidate in a change-year against establishment-candidate Clinton .\nThe danger to our nation , though , is that Trump ’ s belligerent nationalism and militarism represents the same sort of sentiments of the 1930s European National Socialists , and could reform America in a really ugly way , even as he could maintain popularity by being the “ I ’ m here for the 90 % ” candidate by producing a few real social and economic reforms ( yes , the largest part of the early popularity of the European fascists in the 1930s was that they did real social reforms and rebuilt their nation ’ s respective infrastructures and middle classes ) .\nIf the 2016 reform candidate is on the Democratic side and it ’ s Bernie Sanders , he ’ ll almost certainly win against any non-Trump establishment Republican ( and could also easily beat Trump , according to the polls ) . His presidency would force the Democratic Party to re-embrace the 90 % , and , combined with Bernie ’ s positive values of social and economic justice , could take America back to another era of a strong middle class , with peace and prosperity .\n( And either a Trump or Sanders candidacy would only succeed over the loud , powerful , and probably very , very ugly screams and actions of the top 0.001 % and the Koch Network . It ’ d be a titanic battle . )\nIf all the best efforts of the elites in both parties fail ( an unlikely outcome ) , all the polls at this moment show Sanders easily beating Trump , although that could flip in the face of a large market crash or another 9/11-type attack .\nThe more likely outcome , given all the machinations of the elite media and both party ’ s elites , is that the Republicans will nominate an establishment candidate like Kasich or Ryan/Romney , and that the Democratic Party will nominate Hillary Clinton .\nThe choice between an establishment Republican or an establishment Democrat will depress overall political turnout , turn an emerging generation of Millennials into radical cynics , and feed growing explosions among the base of both parties ( Tea Party and the latest version of Occupy/BLM ) . It could mean chaos in our streets for a decade or more .\nNo matter what happens in this 2016 election , though , the bottom 90 % has had enough .\nIf nothing else , the astonishing number of people who say they ’ ll vote for either Trump or Sanders ( i.e . “ the outsider ” ) if the other party ( even their own party ) puts up an establishment candidate is unprecedented , and clearly shows that our nation is on the brink ( if not in the throes ) of a political revolution .\nThe Great Depression of 1930 confronted the world ’ s two largest industrial powers with similar disasters ; Germany and the United States were the hardest hit in terms of a rapid loss of standard of living among the bottom 90 % .\nWe chose FDR ( Sanders ) to lead us out of the mess created by the Republican elites during the Harding , Coolidge , and Hoover administrations . Germany chose Hitler ( Trump ) to lead it out of the mess created by the ruling elites of his day .\nArnold Tynbee is , probably apocryphally , quoted as having said : “ When the last man who remembers the horrors of the last great war dies , the next great war becomes inevitable . ”\nIt could be updated to read today : “ When the people who remember what America was like before the Reagan Revolution begin to die off , the next revolution is inevitable . ”\nWhether it ’ ll be played out in the ballot box or the streets is yet to be seen . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

    "257": "In 2010 , an agreement between Microsoft and the NHS to provide almost all Microsoft software to the service for one single fee and to keep the software updated with new releases was not renewed by the incoming coalition government ( NHS targeted in global cyber-attack , 14 May ) . It cost a few billion , but the budget for it was there , and it saved many billions more . Microsoft also liked it , of course , as it saved it the hassle of organising multiple sales with the many different parts of the service . As I understood it , the Cabinet Office stopped it dead .\nAt the time , I was one of a group of NHS users consulted by those preparing the case for the arrangement to be continued . We were all shocked when it wasn ’ t renewed . Many people argued it was a mistake at the time . This relatively basic IT ( Windows , Office , Mail , SQL server , and so forth ) cost the NHS far more as a result . Further , the lack of the single agreement effectively moved the cost of upgrades on to individual hospitals , community providers , GPs and commissioners , and no new money was made available by the coalition government to help these individual units close the gap .\nObviously , directors of finance looked sceptically at new requests to upgrade systems that seemed to be working perfectly OK , and with the huge pressures on NHS budgets that we all know about , it is perhaps understandable that other local priorities were addressed first . I suspect this goes some way to explain why the NHS was hit harder than many organisations by the recent malware attack – as a result of that single bad decision , the service contains far more older systems which can ’ t be or haven ’ t been updated .\n• The “ ransomware ” attacks targeted PCs which use Windows XP – this is an old operating system and has security flaws . Many organisations have still not completed the upgrade from XP to Windows 7 or 10 – which is a logistical nightmare , very expensive and takes years . Microsoft stopped issuing security patches for XP in 2014 , which means that organisations who use XP have major security risks .\nThe real question is this : who is holding whom to ransom ? Is it the criminal hackers who use ransomware – or is it Microsoft , which put pressure on organisations to do costly upgrades from XP to Windows 7 ( or 10 ) by withdrawing support from XP so that they are then running on insecure operating systems ?\n• Every IT specialist in the NHS knows that the recent cyber-attack was not just bad luck – it was occasioned by criminal negligence and any patients affected should be able to sue the government . Microsoft issued almost daily warnings not to continue using the XP operating system back in 2014 when it withdrew all support for this , and almost all NHS staff upgraded their own systems at home . The only reason the service as a whole did not take the necessary action was that managers preferred to invest incredible sums of money in a vast centralised computer network which failed to materialise while completely ignoring these warnings , and remedial action will now be very expensive , not to mention the cost of this failure to patient ’ s lives .\n• Top civil servants in Whitehall have been pushing government organisations like the NHS into keeping computer records only , without any paper alternative or back up , for the best part of a decade . More and more services such as legal aid and the courts are scrapping the paper version of their applications and records . With these cyber-attacks , we see the way Whitehall has left us all vulnerable . Top civil servants have had a ridiculous faith in modern technology , now seen to be hopelessly misplaced . This was all entirely foreseeable and they have been warned for years . They just would not listen to professionals who told them this would happen . Thankfully there are just enough long-serving civil servants left working to put all the old systems back in place again for them . A complete reversal of policy is urgently needed as clearly demonstrated by the last few days . Plainly we still need the postal service along with our landlines .\n• The blame for these cyber-attacks can be laid squarely at the door of the US National Security Agency . It identified the weakness in Microsoft Windows which was exploited by the attack . But instead of telling Microsoft about it so the vulnerability could be fixed , it appears the agency kept it secret to use it for its own espionage activities . When the details became public after a large cache of NSA documents was posted on the internet , it was inevitable that criminal actors would make use of it . Spying organisations such as the NSA and our own GCHQ suffer a fundamental conflict of interest between their duty to defend their own populations against cyber-attack and practising their own attacks against perceived enemies . Because of the pervasive and instantaneous nature of the internet , if your attack method leaks out it can be used immediately against you . It is the same with encryption : if you once try to weaken it so that security services can break into private data , you eventually weaken it for everyone and everything becomes vulnerable , including the safety of online payments systems . Therefore the hoarding of software vulnerabilities by the agencies must cease . They should concentrate solely on defending systems from attack . Indeed , this was one feature of Microsoft ’ s recent proposal of a digital Geneva convention to tone down the cyber arms race and make the internet a safer place – an initiative we would do well to encourage .\n• The global chaos caused by the recent ransomware attacks is only possible because of the impregnable anonymity of bitcoin . The ideology of bitcoin deserves deeper analysis but it reflects the US libertarian belief that maximum anonymity in financial transactions is always a good thing . However , commerce is a social activity and there are many reasons why society should be in a position , with due safeguards , to investigate suspect transactions and , where necessary , identify both payers and payees . Many of the other claimed benefits of bitcoin are also spurious . Its much-touted security is based on the ownership of a unique key which , because it can never be tied to an individual or recovered by its rightful owner , is just as vulnerable to robbery or theft as cash , with even less chance of recovery . So it is time to stop accepting bitcoin and , while we are at it , to tear down the cloak of darkness that hides far too much of the world ’ s financial activities\n• The rows of frozen NHS screens should serve as a warning to those who advocate online voting in parliamentary elections , not to mention enthusiasts for a cashless society .\n• Didn ’ t I read in ███ that our Trident fleet is still using XP ? Should the Royal Navy be laying aside some bitcoins ? \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

Rob Portman , R-Ohio , once on the short-list to be Mitt Romney 's 2012 running mate , has reversed his opposition to gay marriage , revealing that his own son is gay .\nPortman Thursday told reporters from several Ohio newspapers that when his son , Will , 21 , informed him that he was gay two years ago , `` It allowed me to think of this issue from a new perspective , and that 's of a dad who loves his son a lot and wants him to have the same opportunities that his brother and sister would have , to have a relationship like Jane and I have had for over 26 years , '' according to an interview with the Cleveland Plain Dealer .\nThe newspaper also noted that Portman , who as a congressman backed the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act , thinks part of the law should be repealed . The Supreme Court is set to hear a challenge to the case later this month .\n`` I have come to believe that if two people are prepared to make a lifetime commitment to love and care for each other in good times and in bad , the government should n't deny them the opportunity to get married , '' he wrote in an op-ed that ran Friday in the Columbus Dispatch .\nSen.

    "259": "( CNN ) - Rep. Lynn Jenkins , R-Kansas , faulted Senate Democrats on Saturday for this week 's hike in student loan interest rates and urged the upper chamber to pass legislation that resolves the issue as soon as the holiday recess ends .\n`` For too long , politicians have been in charge of setting these rates , and we keep coming back to cliffs and deadlines like this one , '' Jenkins said in the GOP weekly address . `` Paying for college is difficult enough without all this uncertainty . I have two kids in college , I know how hard it can be . ''\nThe interest rates on some student loans officially doubled Monday - to 6.8 % from 3.4 % - after the Senate failed to reach a compromise by the July 1 deadline .\nThe hike hits about seven million new subsidized Stafford loans this year for middle- and low-income students , but does not apply to existing loans .\nNegotiators are stuck largely on the question of whether to require an overall cap above which interest rates on new loans could not rise .\nTop Senate Democrats want a cap in place to protect students if interest rates spike . That is at odds with the slightly different proposals from President Barack Obama and various congressional Republicans , which are tied to 10-year Treasury bond rates and would include charges for administrative costs but would not include caps .\nRepublicans , who prefer a more market-based approach , often point out that the White House 's proposal falls more in line with their own .\n`` When President Obama proposed letting the markets set interest rates instead , the Republican-led House passed a bill reflecting his plan , '' Jenkins said . `` Republicans in the Senate came to the table with similar ideas . Unfortunately , Senate Democrats attacked the president 's plan , refused to work with us , and allowed this rate hike to take effect , leaving for the July 4th holiday without passing a solution . ''\nSenators worked through last week to try to reach a deal , but lawmakers from both parties ultimately predicted an agreement would not be made in time .\nNevertheless , many of those same senators said they hope to finalize an agreement shortly after the break and have it apply retroactively so students are not hurt by the temporary hike .\nAnother disagreement centers on whether the legislation is revenue-neutral .

Obama reiterated those remarks .\nBut Giuliani castigates the president for not `` acting and speaking in a way that draws sharp , clear distinctions between us and those who threaten our way of life , '' citing Obama 's criticism of U.S. torture techniques in the wake of 9/11 . Obama 's left-wing critics would note that for all the president 's vociferous denunciations of torture , he has opposed legal accountability for those who designed and executed the country 's notorious detention and interrogation program . But Giuliani 's fragile , Manichean mind ca n't tolerate even the mildest suggestion that ours is not an infallible country , and that there may be uncomfortable truths with which we should come to terms . Fox News host Andrea Tantaros offered a particularly telling -- if crude -- case study when she responded to the release of last year 's torture report by declaring that `` America is awesome '' and charging that `` this administration wants to have this discussion to show us how we 're not awesome . '' For a cast of characters constantly proclaiming their own toughness and self-assurance , these are some remarkably thin-skinned people .\nIn one sense , Giuliani is onto something when he seeks to de-personalize his remarks about Obama . At a more fundamental level , his criticism is revelatory of the right wing 's cast of mind , with lessons that go far beyond understanding conservatives ' contempt for the president . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "261": "The minute that self-appointed militiamen stepped onto the property of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge , liberals started worrying that these folks would not be held accountable for their criminal behavior . The group , led by the two sons of right wing radical Cliven Bundy , took over the refuge , demanding that the taxpayers turn over federal lands so that folks like the Bundys and other farmers , miners and other private interests could profit handsomely off the land without having to pay for it . It 's clear that the militiamen expected the feds to rush the compound , causing a firefight in which they could be martyrs for the right wing cause of giving white conservatives a lot of free money while leaving the rest of us out to dry .\nBut that did n't happen . Instead , the federal government seemingly did n't do anything for many weeks , letting these guys get comfortable at the refuge and even go back and forth from it for grocery-shopping , media events , and whatever else their hearts desired . Only one occupier was arrested , for using a stolen vehicle to drive to the store .\nThis lack of interest in having a big ol ' shootout right away on government property did n't just disappoint the militiamen . A number of liberal commentators were miffed that the feds seemed to be twiddling their thumbs , often arguing that if the occupiers were people of color , the shootout would have happened already . The criticism had some merit , of course , but the solution for such a double standard is n't to have more shootouts , so much as it 's an argument against the quick-to-violence reactions law enforcement regrettably has when dealing with non-white suspects .\nThe occupation was expensive and disruptive , of course , leading the Democratic governor of Oregon to ask for the feds to step in . This only reinforced liberal suspicions that the feds were blowing this off and were not going to hold these yahoos accountable for their actions .\nWell , those fears were proven most dramatically wrong Tuesday afternoon , when law enforcement confronted the militiamen on the open highway . A shootout did ensue , which was expected since these folks all have ridiculous martyr fantasies , and one person was killed . So far , there have been eight arrests , and the leaders of this fiasco are in custody . Now the feds have closed in on the refuge , closing roads and access . Without leadership or access to the outside , it wo n't be surprising if the rest of the people inside just give up soon enough .\nThe worrywarts were getting all worked up over nothing . Despite all the hand-wringing over whether the feds were taking this seriously enough , in the end , it turns out that the feds were right and the worrywarts were wrong . Waiting this out a bit , while unfortunately disruptive to the area , ended up being a far more sensible way of dealing with this than trying to raid the wildlife refuge .\nRaiding the refuge was always a bad idea . For one thing it would give these wannabe martyrs exactly what they want , an opportunity to get hurt or die at government hands and become fuel for radical right wing propaganda . They even brought children onto the property to raise the stakes . In the past , federal raids under similar circumstances involving children -- -most notably in Waco -- -not only resulted in innocent lives being lost , but in providing right wing radicals even more justification to demonize federal authorities .\nAnd while the occupation was disruptive and expensive , it would have been far more costly to give the militia the shootout at the refuge they wanted . These guys bragged about how they anticipated violence . They openly threatened that this would become another Waco . Rushing them at the compound would have caused expensive damage to the building , and possibly a fire if the militiamen made good on these threats . Repairing that would have cost a fortune and kept the refuge employees on leave even longer .\nInstead , the feds let the militia get complacent and bored . They let the media attention drift away , forcing the militia to have to take more risks and leave the refuge more to get attention . What looked like federal inattention now looks a whole lot more like it was a trap being set to draw the militia members out .\nIf so , it worked perfectly . The militia members felt emboldened enough to travel 100 miles away from the refuge , and it was out there , without the shelter of the refuge , the presence of cameras , or the ability to use children or neighbors as human shields , that they were finally nabbed by law enforcement . No expensive destruction of property , no dead kids , no officers killed . Only one would-be martyr lost his life .\nBut this was n't just a success from a damage control perspective , either . The federal strategy also kneecapped the propaganda value of this occupation . As I wrote earlier this month , the lengthy occupation gave the militiamen near-daily opportunities to show the world their true colors , proving that they are n't manly warriors taking a stand so much as a bunch of clowns playing dress-up .\nThe arrest is more of the same . Instead of staging some Alamo-inspired last stand in the refuge , they apprehended in the middle of nowhere because they were stupid enough to go on a road trip . The only way this could have been more demoralizing for their cause is if they were wearing adult diapers when they got caught .\nThe entire debacle is n't quite over yet . There are still some militia members holed up in the refuge . But their leaders have all been apprehended . Considering what idiots the leaders were , it 's not unreasonable to think the people who were left to hold down the fort are even less capable of managing this situation . The federal strategy of being patient and waiting for an opportunity will most likely continue to pay off .\nInstead of being angry that the feds did n't rush this compound , liberals should use this story to push for smarter , less aggressive policing generally . We 're in the midst , prompted by the Black Lives Matter movement , of a nationwide discussion about the dangers of the `` shoot first '' philosophy of policing . This story if a perfect example of why it 's better for police to be patient and focused on minimizing damage rather than trying to strong-arm the suspects in every situation . It 's not just the right thing to do , but it 's often the most effective way to get the bad guys without hurting innocent people in the process . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

    "264": "Last year , a white male Princeton undergraduate was asked by a classmate to “ check his privilege. ” Offended by this suggestion , he shot off a 1,300-word essay to the Tory , a right-wing campus newspaper . In it , he wrote about his grandfather who fled the Nazis to Siberia , his grandmother who survived a concentration camp in Germany , about the humble wicker basket business they started in America . He railed against his classmates for “ diminishing everything [ he ’ d ] accomplished , all the hard work [ he ’ d ] done . ”\nHis missive was reprinted by Time . He was interviewed by the New York Times and appeared on Fox News . He became a darling of white conservatives across the country .\nWhat he did not do , at any point , was consider whether being white and male might have given him—if not his ancestors—some advantage in achieving incredible success in America . He did not , in other words , check his privilege .\nTo Robin DiAngelo , professor of multicutural education at Westfield State University and author of What Does it Mean to Be White ? Developing White Racial Literacy , Tal Fortgang ’ s essay—indignant , defensive , beside-the-point , somehow both self-pitying and self-aggrandizing—followed a familiar script . As an anti-racist educator for more than two decades , DiAngelo has heard versions of it recited hundreds of times by white men and women in her workshops .\nShe ’ s heard it so many times , in fact , that she came up with a term for it : `` white fragility , '' which she defined in a 2011 journal article as “ a state in which even a minimum amount of racial stress becomes intolerable , triggering a range of defensive moves . These moves include outward display of emotions such as anger , fear and guilt , and behaviors such as argumentation , silence and leaving the stress-inducing situation . ”\nWhen the Black Lives Matter movement marched in the streets , holding up traffic , disrupting commerce , and refusing to allow `` normal life '' to resume—insofar as normalcy means a system that permits police and vigilantes to murder black men and women with impunity—white people found themselves in tense conversations online , with friends and in the media about privilege , white supremacy and racism . You could say white fragility was at an all-time high .\nI spoke with DiAngelo about how to deal with all the fragile white people , and why it ’ s worth doing so .\nSam Adler-Bell : How did you come to write about `` white fragility '' ?\nRobin DiAngelo : To be honest , I wanted to take it on because it ’ s a frustrating dynamic that I encounter a lot . I don ’ t have a lot of patience for it . And I wanted to put a mirror to it .\nI do atypical work for a white person , which is that I lead primarily white audiences in discussions on race every day , in workshops all over the country . That has allowed me to observe very predictable patterns . And one of those patterns is this inability to tolerate any kind of challenge to our racial reality . We shut down or lash out or in whatever way possible block any reflection from taking place .\nOf course , it functions as means of resistance , but I think it ’ s also useful to think about it as fragility , as inability to handle the stress of conversations about race and racism\nSometimes it ’ s strategic , a very intentional push back and rebuttal . But a lot of the time , the person simply can not function . They regress into an emotional state that prevents anybody from moving forward .\nSAB : Carla Murphy recently referenced `` white fragility '' in an article for Colorlines , and I ’ ve seen it referenced on Twitter and Facebook a lot lately . It seems like it ’ s having a moment . Why do you think that is ?\nRD : I think we get tired of certain terms . What I do used to be called `` diversity training , '' then `` cultural competency '' and now , `` anti-racism . '' These terms are really useful for periods of time , but then they get coopted , and people build all this baggage around them , and you have to come up with new terms or else people won ’ t engage .\nAnd I think `` white privilege '' has reached that point . It rocked my world when I first really got it , when I came across Peggy McIntosh . It ’ s a really powerful start for people . But unfortunately it 's been played so much now that it turns people off .\nRD : For white people , their identities rest on the idea of racism as about good or bad people , about moral or immoral singular acts , and if we ’ re good , moral people we can ’ t be racist – we don ’ t engage in those acts . This is one of the most effective adaptations of racism over time—that we can think of racism as only something that individuals either are or are not “ doing . ”\nIn large part , white fragility—the defensiveness , the fear of conflict—is rooted in this good/bad binary . If you call someone out , they think to themselves , “ What you just said was that I am a bad person , and that is intolerable to me. ” It ’ s a deep challenge to the core of our identity as good , moral people .\nThe good/bad binary is also what leads to the very unhelpful phenomenon of un-friending on Facebook .\nSAB : Right , because the instinct is to un-friend , to dissociate from those bad white people , so that I ’ m not implicated in their badness .\nRD : When I ’ m doing a workshop with white people , I ’ ll often say , “ If we don ’ t work with each other , if we give in to that pull to separate , who have we left to deal with the white person that we ’ ve given up on and won ’ t address ?\nRD : Exactly . And white fragility also comes from a deep sense of entitlement . Think about it like this : from the time I opened my eyes , I have been told that as a white person , I am superior to people of color . There ’ s never been a space in which I have not been receiving that message . From what hospital I was allowed to be born in , to how my mother was treated by the staff , to who owned the hospital , to who cleaned the rooms and took out the garbage . We are born into a racial hierarchy , and every interaction with media and culture confirms it—our sense that , at a fundamental level , we are superior .\nAnd , the thing is , it feels good . Even though it contradicts our most basic principles and values . So we know it , but we can never admit it . It creates this kind of dangerous internal stew that gets enacted externally in our interactions with people of color , and is crazy-making for people of color . We have set the world up to preserve that internal sense of superiority and also resist challenges to it . All while denying that anything is going on and insisting that race is meaningless to us .\nSAB : Something that amazes me is the sophistication of some white people ’ s defensive maneuvers . I have a black friend who was accused of `` online harassment '' by a white friend after he called her out in a harsh way . What do you see going on there ?\nRD : First of all , whites often confuse comfort with safety . We say we don ’ t feel safe , when what we mean is that we don ’ t feel comfortable . Secondly , no white person looks at a person of color through objective eyes . There ’ s been a lot of research in this area . Cross-racially , we do not see with objective eyes . Now you add that he ’ s a black man . It ’ s not a fluke that she picked the word `` harassed . '' In doing that , she ’ s reinforcing a really classic , racist paradigm : White women and black men . White women ’ s frailty and black men ’ s aggressiveness and danger .\nBut even if she is feeling that , which she very well may be , we should be suspicious of our feelings in these interactions . There ’ s no such thing as pure feeling . You have a feeling because you ’ ve filtered the experience through a particular lens . The feeling is the outcome . It probably feels natural , but of course it ’ s shaped by what you believe .\nRD : Yes . One of the things I try to work with white people on is letting go of our criteria about how people of color give us feedback . We have to build our stamina to just be humble and bear witness to the pain we ’ ve caused .\nIn my workshops , one of the things I like to ask white people is , “ What are the rules for how people of color should give us feedback about our racism ? What are the rules , where did you get them , and whom do they serve ? ” Usually those questions alone make the point .\nIt ’ s like if you ’ re standing on my head and I say , “ Get off my head , ” and you respond , “ Well , you need to tell me nicely. ” I ’ d be like , “ No . Fuck you . Get off my fucking head . ”\nIn the course of my work , I ’ ve had many people of color give me feedback in ways that might be perceived as intense or emotional or angry . And on one level , it ’ s personal—I did do that thing that triggered the response , but at the same time it isn ’ t onlypersonal . I represent a lifetime of people that have hurt them in the same way that I just did .\nAnd , honestly , the fact that they are willing to show me demonstrates , on some level , that they trust me .\nRD : If people of color went around showing the pain they feel in every moment that they feel it , they could be killed . It is dangerous . They can not always share their outrage about the injustice of racism . White people can ’ t tolerate it . And we punish it severely—from job loss , to violence , to murder .\nFor them to take that risk and show us , that is a moment of trust . I say , bring it on , thank you .\nWhen I ’ m doing a workshop , I ’ ll often ask the people of color in the room , somewhat facetiously , “ How often have you given white people feedback about our inevitable and often unconscious racist patterns and had that go well for you ? ” And they laugh .\nBecause it just doesn ’ t go well . And so one time I asked , “ What would your daily life be like if you could just simply give us feedback , have us receive it graciously , reflect on it and work to change the behavior ? What would your life be like ? ”\nAnd this one man of color looked at me and said , “ It would be revolutionary . ”\nSAB : I notice as we ’ ve been talking that you almost always use the word `` we '' when describing white people ’ s tendencies . Can you tell me why you do that ?\nRD : Well , for one , I ’ m white ( and you ’ re white ) . And even as committed as I am , I ’ m not outside of anything that I ’ m talking about here . If I went around saying white people this and white people that , it would be a distancing move . I don ’ t want to reinforce the idea that there are some whites who are done , and others that still need work . There ’ s no being finished .\nPlus , in my work , I ’ m usually addressing white audiences , and the `` we '' diminishes defensiveness somewhat . It makes them more comfortable . They see that I ’ m not just pointing fingers outward .\nRD : Well , yes . I continually struggle with that reality . By standing up there as an authority on whiteness , I ’ m necessarily reinforcing my authority as a white person . It goes with the territory . For example , you ’ re interviewing me now , on whiteness , and people of color have been saying these things for a very long time .\nOn the one hand , I know that in many ways , white people can hear me in a way that they can ’ t hear people of color . They listen . So by god , I ’ m going to use my voice to challenge racism . The only alternative I can see is to not speak up and challenge racism . And that is not acceptable to me .\nSAB : Yes , and racism is something that everyone thinks they ’ re an authority on .\nRD : That drives me crazy . I ’ ll run into someone I haven ’ t seen in 20 years in the grocery store , and they ’ ll say , “ Hi ! What ’ ve you been doing ? ”\nAnd they ’ ll go “ Oh , well you know . People just need to— ”\nAs if they ’ re going to give me the one-sentence answer to arguably the most challenging social dynamic of our time . Like , hey , why did I knock myself out for 20 years studying , researching , and challenging this within myself and others ? I should have just come to you ! And the answer is so simple ! I ’ ve never heard that one before !\nImagine if I was an astronomer . Everybody has a basic understanding of the sky , but they would not debate an astronomer on astronomy . The arrogance of white people faced with questions of race is unbelievable . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "265": "A photo of the author Confessions of a recovering Libertarian : How I escaped a world of Ron Paul hero worship In the right hands , libertarianism could be a middle-of-the-road philosophy . Instead , here 's what turned me away\nWhen I was 15 , I was that kid people wanted to punch in the face . I sent emails to Wolf Blitzer and Glenn Beck asking them just how in the world they could ’ ve said the Libertarian Party was “ fringe. ” I booed when my classmate mentioned the New Deal in a presentation on `` The Great Gatsby . '' When my Ron Paul 2008 sweat shirt went missing on a family vacation , I immediately implicated the CIA in the abduction .\nI am not that kid anymore , which bodes well for the continued integrity of my facial structure . My views haven ’ t changed as much as you might expect ; I maintain that centralized government power , whether in the economic or social sphere , results in corruption and abuse more often than not . But when people ask me where I stand ideologically , I cringe at the thought of responding with “ freedom ” or “ limited government , ” phrases that I once seemed destined to have tattooed on my forehead . Now , I ’ m more likely to stammer for a few seconds before coming up with something like , “ Hey , uh , it ’ s pretty sunny out there today , no ? ”\nPeople always told me that my staunch libertarianism would erode when I went to college and saw the world through a wider lens . I didn ’ t believe them , just like I didn ’ t believe their claims that Ron Paul would fall short of the presidency , but we know how that turned out . Contrary to how the story often goes , there was no professor , classmate or piece of reading that exhorted me toward neoconservatism or Marxism . Instead , it was consorting with my fellow libertarians that drove me away .\nMy realization of the libertarian tragedy began , as most tragedies do , with social media . I attended college in Washington , D.C. , a place that may not appeal to libertarians as much as it does to mainstream partisans , but still has a fair number of freedom-minded folks who call it home . When I was accepted for study , I connected with my school ’ s College Libertarians Facebook group . They were a tight-knit bunch , but they embraced my eagerness to join their ranks . Soon , my Facebook feed was filled with all kinds of Ayn Rand quotes and Gadsden flags . Posts like the one claiming that public schools , the very institutions that employed many of my family members , were “ replete with agents of state-orchestrated indoctrination ” ( good job with the SAT words there , guys ) were enough to keep me from ever showing up to a College Libertarians meeting .\nStill , a few crazy Facebookers weren ’ t going to douse my political aspirations . I made my way through a revolving door of internships on Capitol Hill and at nonprofits . It was in a congressional office that I became acutely aware of a group of people I call “ Discipauls , ” and learned just how troublesome they could be . I want to be clear that a mere Ron Paul supporter is often completely different from a Discipaul . Plenty of people are sympathetic to the anti-establishment former congressman , and with good reason , but few of them reach the Discipauls ’ level of kookery . The Discipauls could not go a day without bringing their faxes and phone calls to the interns ’ attention . Their messages of “ Hey , vote for this bill because Ron Paul supports it ! ” or “ All of the presidential candidates not named Ron Paul are guilty of treason ! ” were relentless .\nSometimes , on rare days when internship-related drudgery hadn ’ t caused me to glaze over , I would challenge and debate the Discipauls ( this was explicitly not to be part of my job description – oops ) . There was a consistent lack of constitutional literacy and current events knowledge emanating from their end of the phone line . One lady called me , practically out of breath over the fact that Obamacare would “ mandate microchip implantation for all citizens. ” When I asked her where she found this information , she referred me to a YouTube video called “ 666 Mark of the Beast. ” The Discipauls ’ approach toward gathering information seemed to be “ if Ron or someone supporting him says something , take their word for it , ” which , interestingly , is the exact opposite of what Paul himself preached about activism on the campaign trail .\nOne would think that the craziest Discipauls would be limited to the type of people who had nothing better to do but call their representative on weekday afternoons , but a surprising number of these people showed up in nonprofit offices and at professional networking events . Young and naive as I was , the dogmatism of these libertarians surprised me . One of the reasons I was drawn to the liberty movement in the first place was its purported aversion to dogma . Libertarians rejected the two major-party platforms that Americans are expected to conform to , and instead took the initiative to seek out a more obscure way of thinking . There is a long tradition of skepticism among libertarian thinkers , so it ’ s maddening to see this skepticism disappear when it comes to Ron Paul and his closest allies . The Discipauls engage in the same unquestioning hero worship that causes them to deride equally enthusiastic Barack Obama supporters as “ zombies , ” or the particularly vomit-inducing “ sheeple . ”\nThe high-school me viewed libertarianism as a middle-of-the-road philosophy . Those “ What Are Your Political Views ? ” quizzes always placed me smack in the center of the left-right spectrum . My favorite libertarians always seemed to combine the best elements of conservatism and liberalism ; I was concerned about the effects of deficit spending and inflation , but I was equally interested in gay rights and the many costs of war . This particular blend of ideology went down smoothly with many people I talked to , so it seemed to me then that it would only be a matter of time before libertarianism would take hold with the non-Guy-Fawkes-mask-wearing crowd .\nOf course , libertarianism has not taken hold in any meaningful way , because it is not a middle-of-the-road philosophy at all . In the right hands , it could be , but its current practitioners are keeping it on the margins of political discourse . The two best descriptors that come to mind are “ extreme ” and “ rigid. ” Libertarians could build up quite a bit of goodwill with their fiscally conservative and socially liberal leanings , if they didn ’ t insist on leaning so damn far . Bullheaded , reductive platitudes like “ taxation is theft ” instantly alienate people who , say , are victims of actual theft .\nKnee-jerk anti-government sentiment is not a viable political philosophy . It doesn ’ t work in theory , and is a disaster in practice , but it ’ s what libertarians have allowed their movement to become . The traditions of questioning authority and thinking rationally don ’ t apply when it comes to their own authority figures and policy prescriptions . Cost-benefit analysis can provide a much more nuanced argument than “ all government is EVIL , ” but it ’ s all too rare to see a libertarian making use of statistical diagnostics .\nMy recovery accelerated earlier this year , when I received an internship with the help of an organization whose very name would send most of this site ’ s readers into anaphylactic shock . I was already grappling with serious reservations about continuing my career in politics , but as a freshly graduated English major with a liberty-heavy résumé , I couldn ’ t afford to turn away from those who somehow found it wise to pay me money for my services .\nHere I was surrounded by the type of people who wore suits to work daily , thrilled to one-up the business-casual dress code . My co-workers awoke in the mornings thinking about liberty , went to their offices and worked on liberty , took lunch breaks to talk about liberty , and then left work and volunteered at soup kitchens in the evenings . I ’ m just kidding about that last one ; they went home and made Facebook posts about liberty , of course !\nThey were the most paranoid , humorless and obsessive people I ’ d ever been around -- the perfect example of the kinds of people hijacking what could be a reasonable philosophical movement . They would return to work on Mondays talking about the Super Freedom Voluntarist America conference they had all attended over the weekend . When I told them that I ’ d attended a Nationals game with some liberal friends instead , their faces looked as if I had made them eat live snails with smallpox sauce . It wasn ’ t terribly surprising behavior from people who felt that the whole world was against them , and didn ’ t own a book without the phrase “ anarcho-capitalist ” in it .\nOf course , while wading through the sea of interns , I met a handful of exceptionally kind , open-minded and compassionate people , the type of people who reminded me why I used to be so proud to call myself a libertarian . These people were more than willing to listen to arguments and read books by those they disagreed with . They were far more concerned by the effects of drug laws on minority populations than they were by a couple of extra percentage points ' worth of corporate taxes for big businesses . Most important , they were eager to take breaks from politics outside of work hours , knowing that if they spent a few hours watching movies or playing in bands , America wouldn ’ t turn into North Korea overnight .\nThe problem is that their movement has been largely co-opted by zealots and politicians who are doing it harm . I only hope that the rest of the libertarians learn that this brand of unrelenting , self-serious extremism isn ’ t helping their cause . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

    "268": "Six bullets . More than I can count on one hand . That is how many times preliminary autopsy reports indicate that Michael Brown was shot . Nothing about the youthful infraction of strolling down the middle of a residential street in one ’ s own neighborhood justifies having your life ripped away from you by an irate officer firing six bullets as you face him , hands up in surrender .\nI can not even fathom what Mike , “ Big Mike ” as his friends call him , felt as each of those bullets entered his flesh . I do know a little of the rage , despair , helplessness and hopelessness that black communities have been left to feel in the aftermath of his death . I know he stayed conscious long enough to put his hands up , to try and surrender , as if to say , “ I want to live . Please don ’ t kill me . ”\nFerguson residents and protesters now find themselves arms outstretched , palms up , yelling “ don ’ t shoot , ” as police officers in guns , gas masks and tanks occupy the streets of Ferguson , Missouri , dropping canisters of tear gas on our American dreams . Those of us not yet there in Ferguson watch helplessly as the images of at least one child being tear-gassed come through our Twitter feeds , as journalists find themselves facing down the barrel of a hastily drawn police weapon or thrown in jail , as police drop stun grenades on crowds that refuse to comply with the unreasonable demand that they relinquish their right to peaceful assembly .\nWhile the world watches aghast , America ’ s penchant for exporting guns , tanks and destruction to other places in the name of law and order has shown up on our own doorsteps , in our backyards , with people pinned into parking lots and onto their porches . They are told they must stay where they are or risk being shot with rubber bullets or have their faces and lungs sting with the inhalation of tear gas .\nPublic space in Ferguson is awash in black tears , but it is the sirens that we hear wailing . The people would weep , but they are too busy running , ducking and taking cover from the angry sounds of a system that does not love them , does not care about their meager “ rights . ”\nMeanwhile , the government attempts to placate the people with optical sleights of hand . Capt . Ron Johnson , by all accounts a sincere and affable leader and head of the highway patrol , replaced the police chief late last week , with promises that he would not employ military tactics to police the citizens of Ferguson . On Thursday I breathed a bit easier as we watched him giving hugs to protesters , marching with the people , allowing black women of faith to lay hands on him and pray .\nThat peace was short-lived after the Ferguson police inflamed crowds by releasing irrelevant footage of a conflict that Michael Brown had at a local convenience store when he and his friend Dorian went to buy Cigarellos . Late that evening the crowds returned , only to be met by more tanks , more tear gas , more guns .\nBeyond shock , I continue to be appalled at the extensive lengths to which the police have gone to protect Officer Darren Wilson and his family from any public reproach or reprisal in Mike ’ s death . They delayed the release of his name in order to provide him enough time to leave town . They then released his name to coincide with video of the Cigarello incident , which they later admitted he knew nothing about when he stopped Mike . It is clear that the police are closing ranks , showing that they value the lives of their own more than the lives of citizens .\nWe are told repeatedly that police are worthy of our respect because they risk their lives each day to protect us . That is not the case for black people . When we encounter police , our lives are at risk while they protect themselves . I started to temper my statement by saying “ some police , ” but that gives the impression that I am speaking of the actions of a few rogue officers . The problem with this logic is that we now know that Ferguson law enforcement has a range of problems – disproportionate stops of black residents , disproportionately low numbers of black police ( three out of over 50 ) , and a history of antagonistic exchanges with the people of St. Louis County .\nWe have a problem of overzealous policing in this country . That problem is exacerbated by issues of race and gender , so that black men are perceived to be far more threatening than they actually are . And when black women encounter police , we are not given the protections generally afforded to white femininity . Our womanhood does not mitigate the threat of police force . This , then , is not about the actions of a rogue officer , but rather about the ideology of overpolicing that deputizes extrajudicial behavior as completely justified , as long as the life being taken or haphazardly handled is a black or brown life . Though the killing of Brown by Wilson seemingly fits a long historical script of the harassment of black people at the hands of white police officers , the reality is that overpolicing is an ideology that many police officers subscribe to regardless of color .\nThat ideology is rooted in a kind of anti-blackness that sees black bodies as a perpetual and mortal threat . Anti-black rhetoric has shown up not only from the Ferguson police but also ironically in the reporting and advocacy of everyone from CNN reporter Don Lemon to rapper Nelly , in their continued focus on issues like “ black-on-black crime ” and the necessity of keeping law and order . “ Don ’ t use your last option , first , ” Nelly told folks on St. Louis radio . There is little recognition that it is Darren Wilson who used his last option – lethal force — first . Moreover , the whole point of using tear gas and military vehicles in this small community is to force the residents into a realization that they have run out of options . Sadly , anti-black ideology can emerge even from people who are black or who otherwise love black people .\nI know Americans like to see themselves as a law and order people , but the few folks who have rioted and looted over the last few days , many of whom are reportedly not Ferguson residents , were stopped in their tracks by peaceful protesters . Even still their presence exposes an inconvenient truth . The killing of unarmed teenagers by police officers is lawlessness . It shows a lack of respect for the sanctity of life and the rule of law . The supreme irony is seeing folks defend the officer ’ s lawlessness while calling for people destroying property to respect the law .\nAs I keep saying , destruction of property is not particularly productive . But I refuse to direct my ire toward anyone but the officer who unjustly took Michael Brown ’ s life and the police establishment that is now complicit in this crime .\nI am tired . Emotionally exhausted , actually . I am tired of going to sleep each night seeing a community of people who look like me under military siege . I ’ m tired of seeing crying black mothers – Sybrina Fulton , Lucia McBath and Leslie McSpadden —distraught over the loss of their teenage sons Trayvon , Jordan and Michael . I ’ m tired of hearing report after report of people under attack from tear gas . I ’ m tired of journalists being bullied for trying to tell the truth . I ’ m tired of explaining to white people why our anger is justified , why looting , which is a property crime , should not even be part of a conversation about the killing of a teenager , why the alleged shoplifting of cigarettes is not a capital offense , why the police officer who killed Mike for the crime of walking in the street is the real thug .\nWhite racism and white privilege continue a bad cop-good cop routine with black America that is utterly exhausting . Just when we think we are making headway , a well-meaning white person asks “ but can ’ t we condemn the looting too ? ” The question is : Have you condemned the killing ? Or have you tried to explain it away ? To justify it ?\nI will not engage in a condemnation quid pro quo with trolls , well-meaning white citizens or respectable black ones , “ Brand New Negroes ” I call them , in the tradition of the famous text from Harlem Renaissance philosopher Alain Locke . I will not concede that destruction of property is equal to the taking of life . I will not answer calls to be reasonable in the face of unreasonable , unjustifiable black death . I will not believe the lie that black propriety and respectability – pulling our pants up , speaking corporate English , never , ever doing anything wrong – will save us .\nFerguson exposes the extent to which American necropolitics shapes the terms and conditions of black life in what professor Sundiata Cha-Jua calls a new racial nadir . The first racial nadir happened from about 1890 to about 1930 , when black people experienced the unprecedented loss of political gains hard won in the aftermath of the Civil War and the astronomical rise of lynching . We have indeed reached a new nadir in America ’ s racial life , one hard to fathom as a black president sits in the White House , abdicating his responsibility to speak forcefully and forthrightly to the problem of racism and military-style policing both for fear of being seen as too “ black ” and for fear of political reprisal from the right .\nMeanwhile , our voting rights have been stripped away , our kids are being killed in the streets , their killers rarely convicted , and our communities are placed under siege . And our black president reminds us that `` there are young black men who commit crime , '' though he feels no responsibility to say this about any other race of people . It 's a shaming tactic that suggests that black people do not have the right to be angry when our communities are beset with so many problems . It is the kind of anti-black thinking that suggests `` acting respectably '' will save us .\nThese are scary times . They are times for rage . Time for telling the truth . Time for ripping the band-aids off our gaping wounds . Time to recognize that we can neither heal nor fix that which we will not confront . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "269": "Have you ever undertaken some task you felt less than qualified for , but knew that someone needed to do ? Consider this piece my version of that , and let me put what I do understand about it in a nutshell : based on developments in our post-9/11 world , we could be watching the birth of a new American political system and way of governing for which , as yet , we have no name .\nAnd here ’ s what I find strange : the evidence of this , however inchoate , is all around us and yet it ’ s as if we can ’ t bear to take it in or make sense of it or even say that it might be so .\nLet me make my case , however minimally , based on five areas in which at least the faint outlines of that new system seem to be emerging : political campaigns and elections ; the privatization of Washington through the marriage of the corporation and the state ; the de-legitimization of our traditional system of governance ; the empowerment of the national security state as an untouchable fourth branch of government ; and the demobilization of `` we the people . ''\nWhatever this may add up to , it seems to be based , at least in part , on the increasing concentration of wealth and power in a new plutocratic class and in that ever-expanding national security state . Certainly , something out of the ordinary is underway , and yet its birth pangs , while widely reported , are generally categorized as aspects of an exceedingly familiar American system somewhat in disarray .\nCheck out the news about the 2016 presidential election and you ’ ll quickly feel a sense of been-there , done-that . As a start , the two names most associated with it , Bush and Clinton , couldn ’ t be more familiar , highlighting as they do the curiously dynastic quality of recent presidential contests . ( If a Bush or Clinton should win in 2016 and again in 2020 , a member of one of those families will have controlled the presidency for 28 of the last 36 years . )\nTake , for instance , “ Why 2016 Is Likely to Become a Close Race , ” a recent piece Nate Cohn wrote for my hometown paper . A noted election statistician , Cohn points out that , despite Hillary Clinton ’ s historically staggering lead in Democratic primary polls ( and lack of serious challengers ) , she could lose the general election . He bases this on what we know about her polling popularity from the Monica Lewinsky moment of the 1990s to the present . Cohn assures readers that Hillary will not “ be a Democratic Eisenhower , a popular , senior statesperson who cruises to an easy victory. ” It ’ s the sort of comparison that offers a certain implicit reassurance about the near future . ( No , Virginia , we haven ’ t left the world of politics in which former general and president Dwight D. Eisenhower can still be a touchstone . )\nCohn may be right when it comes to Hillary ’ s electability , but this is not Dwight D. Eisenhower ’ s or even Al Gore ’ s America . If you want a measure of that , consider this year ’ s primaries . I mean , of course , the 2015 ones . Once upon a time , the campaign season started with candidates flocking to Iowa and New Hampshire early in the election year to establish their bona fides among party voters . These days , however , those are already late primaries .\nThe early primaries , the ones that count , take place among a small group of millionaires andbillionaires , a new caste flush with cash who will personally , or through complex networks of funders , pour multi-millions of dollars into the campaigns of candidates of their choice . So the early primaries -- this year mainly a Republican affair -- are taking place in resort spots like Las Vegas , Rancho Mirage , California , and Sea Island , Georgia , as has been widely reported . These “ contests ” involve groveling politicians appearing at the beck and call of the rich and powerful , and so reflect our new 1 % electoral system . ( The main pro-Hillary super PAC , for instance , is aiming for a kitty of $ 500 million heading into 2016 , while the Koch brothers network has already promised to drop almost $ 1 billion into the coming campaign season , doubling their efforts in the last presidential election year . )\nEver since the Supreme Court opened up the ultimate floodgates with its 2010 Citizens United decision , each subsequent election has seen record-breaking amounts of money donated and spent . The 2012 presidential campaign was the first $ 2 billion election ; campaign 2016 is expected to hit the $ 5 billion mark without breaking a sweat . By comparison , according to Burton Abrams and Russell Settle in their study , “ The Effect of Broadcasting on Political Campaign Spending , ” Republicans and Democrats spent just under $ 13 million combined in 1956 when Eisenhower won his second term .\nIn the meantime , it ’ s still true that the 2016 primaries will involve actual voters , as will the election that follows . The previous election season , the midterms of 2014 , cost almost $ 4 billion , a record despite the number of small donors continuing to drop . It also represented the lowest midterm voter turnout since World War II . ( See : demobilization of the public , below -- and add in the demobilization of the Democrats as a real party , the breaking of organized labor , the fragmenting of the Republican Party , and the return of voter suppression laws visibly meant to limit the franchise . ) It hardly matters just what the flood of new money does in such elections , when you can feel the weight of inequality bearing down on the whole process in a way that is pushing us somewhere new .\n2 . The Privatization of the State ( or the U.S. as a Prospective Third-World Nation )\nIn the recent coverage of the Hillary Clinton email flap , you can find endless references to the Clintons of yore in wink-wink , you-know-how-they-are-style reporting ; and yes , she did delete a lot of emails ; and yes , it ’ s an election year coming and , as everyone points out , the Republicans are going to do their best to keep the email issue alive until hell freezes over , etc. , etc . Again , the coverage , while eyeball gluing , is in a you ’ ve-seen-it-all-before , you ’ ll-see-it-all-again-mode .\nHowever , you haven ’ t seen it all before . The most striking aspect of this little brouhaha lies in what ’ s most obvious but least highlighted . An American secretary of state chose to set up her own private , safeguarded email system for doing government work ; that is , she chose to privatize her communications . If this were Cairo , it might not warrant a second thought . But it didn ’ t happen in some third-world state . It was the act of a key official of the planet ’ s reigning ( or thrashing ) superpower , which -- even if it wasn ’ t the first time such a thing had ever occurred -- should be taken as a tiny symptom of something that couldn ’ t be larger or , in the long stretch of history , newer : the ongoing privatization of the American state , or at least the national security part of it .\nThough the marriage of the state and the corporation has a pre-history , the full-scale arrival of the warrior corporation only occurred after 9/11 . Someday , that will undoubtedly be seen as a seminal moment in the formation of whatever may be coming in this country . Only 13 years later , there is no part of the war state that has not experienced major forms of privatization . The U.S. military could no longer go to war without its crony corporationsdoing KP and guard duty , delivering the mail , building the bases , and being involved in just about all of its activities , including training the militaries of foreign allies and even fighting . Such warrior corporations are now involved in every aspect of the national security state , including torture , drone strikes , and -- to the tune of hundreds of thousands of contract employees like Edward Snowden -- intelligence gathering and spying . You name it and , in these years , it ’ s been at least partly privatized .\nAll you have to do is read reporter James Risen ’ s recent book , Pay Any Price , on how the global war on terror was fought in Washington , and you know that privatization has brought something else with it : corruption , scams , and the gaming of the system for profits of a sort that might normally be associated with a typical third-world kleptocracy . And all of this , a new world being born , was reflected in a tiny way in Hillary Clinton ’ s very personal decision about her emails .\nThough it ’ s a subject I know so much less about , this kind of privatization ( and the corruption that goes with it ) is undoubtedly underway in the non-war-making , non-security-projecting part of the American state as well .\nOn a third front , American “ confidence ” in the three classic check-and-balance branches of government , as measured by polling outfits , continues to fall . In 2014 , Americans expressing a “ great deal of confidence ” in the Supreme Court hit a new low of 23 % ; in the presidency , it was 11 % , and in Congress a bottom-scraping 5 % . ( The military , on the other hand , registers at 50 % . ) The figures for “ hardly any confidence at all ” are respectively 20 % , 44 % , and more than 50 % . All are in or near record-breaking territory for the last four decades .\nIt seems fair to say that in recent years Congress has been engaged in a process of delegitimizing itself . Where that body once had the genuine power to declare war , for example , it is now “ debating ” in a desultory fashion an “ authorization ” for a war against the Islamic State in Syria , Iraq , and possibly elsewhere that has already been underway for eight months and whose course , it seems , will be essentially unaltered , whether Congress authorizes it or not .\nWhat would President Harry Truman , who once famously ran a presidential campaign against a “ do-nothing ” Congress , have to say about a body that truly can do just about nothing ? Or rather , to give the Republican war hawks in that new Congress their due , not quite nothing . They are proving capable of acting effectively to delegitimize the presidency as well . House Majority Leader John Boehner ’ s invitation to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to undercut the president 's Iranian nuclear negotiations and the lettersigned by 47 Republican senators and directed to the Iranian ayatollahs are striking examples of this . They are visibly meant to tear down an “ imperial presidency ” that Republicans gloried in not so long ago .\nThe radical nature of that letter , not as an act of state but of its de-legitimization , was noted even in Iran , where fundamentalist Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei proclaimed it “ a sign of a decline in political ethics and the destruction of the American establishment from within. ” Here , however , the letter is either being covered as a singularly extreme one-off act ( “ treason ! ” ) or , as Jon Stewart did on “ The Daily Show , ” as part of a repetitive tit-for-tat between Democrats and Republicans over who controls foreign policy . It is , in fact , neither . It represents part of a growing pattern in which Congress becomes an ever less effective body , except in its willingness to take on and potentially take out the presidency .\nIn the twenty-first century , all that “ small government ” Republicans and “ big government ” Democrats can agree on is offering essentially unconditional support to the military and the national security state . The Republican Party -- its various factions increasingly at each other ’ s throats almost as often as at those of the Democrats -- seems reasonably united solely on issues of war-making and security . As for the Democrats , an unpopular administration , facing constant attack by those who loath President Obama , has kept its footing in part by allying with and fusing with the national security state . A president who came into office rejecting torture and promoting sunshine and transparency in government has , in the course of six-plus years , come to identify himself almost totally with the U.S. military , the CIA , the NSA , and the like . While it has launched an unprecedented campaign against whistleblowers and leakers ( as well as sunshine and transparency ) , the Obama White House has proved a powerful enabler of , but also remarkably dependent upon , that state-within-a-state , a strange fate for “ the imperial presidency . ”\n4 . The Rise of the National Security State as the Fourth Branch of Government\nOne “ branch ” of government is , however , visibly on the rise and rapidly gaining independence from just about any kind of oversight . Its ability to enact its wishes with almost no opposition in Washington is a striking feature of our moment . But while the symptoms of this process are regularly reported , the overall phenomenon -- the creation of ade facto fourth branch of government -- gets remarkably little attention . In the war on terror era , the national security state has come into its own . Its growth has been phenomenal . Though it ’ s seldom pointed out , it should be considered remarkable that in this period we gained a second full-scale “ defense department , ” the Department of Homeland Security , and that it and the Pentagon have become even more entrenched , each surrounded by its own growing “ complex ” of private corporations , lobbyists , and allied politicians . The militarization of the country has , in these years , proceeded apace .\nMeanwhile , the duplication to be found in the U.S. Intelligence Community with its 17 major agencies and outfits is staggering . Its growing ability to surveil and spy on a global scale , including on its own citizens , puts the totalitarian states of the twentieth century to shame . That the various parts of the national security state can act in just about any fashion without fear of accountability in a court of law is by now too obvious to belabor . As wealth has traveled upwards in American society in ways not seen since the first Gilded Age , so taxpayer dollars have migrated into the national security state in an almost plutocratic fashion .\nNew reports regularly surface about the further activities of parts of that state . In recent weeks , for instance , we learned from Jeremy Scahill and Josh Begley of the Intercept that the CIA has spent years trying to break the encryption on Apple iPhones and iPads ; it has , that is , been aggressively seeking to attack an all-American corporation ( even if significant parts of its production process are actually in China ) . Meanwhile , Devlin Barrett of the Wall Street Journal reported that the CIA , an agency barred from domestic spying operations of any sort , has been helping the U.S . Marshals Service ( part of the Justice Department ) create an airborne digital dragnet on American cell phones . Planes flying out of five U.S. cities carry a form of technology that `` mimics a cellphone tower . '' This technology , developed and tested in distant American war zones and now brought to `` the homeland , '' is just part of the ongoing militarization of the country from its borders to its police forces . And there ’ s hardly been a week since Edward Snowden first released crucial NSA documents in June 2013 when such “ advances ” haven ’ t been in the news .\nNews also regularly bubbles up about the further expansion , reorganization , and upgrading of parts of the intelligence world , the sorts of reports that have become the barely noticed background hum of our lives . Recently , for instance , Director John Brennan announced a major reorganization of the CIA meant to break down the classic separation between spies and analysts at the Agency , while creating a new Directorate of Digital Innovation responsible for , among other things , cyberwarfare and cyberespionage . At about the same time , according to the New York Times , the Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications , an obscure State Department agency , was given a new and expansive role in coordinating “ all the existing attempts at countermessaging [ against online propaganda by terror outfits like the Islamic State ] by much larger federal departments , including the Pentagon , Homeland Security and intelligence agencies . ”\nThis sort of thing is par for the course in an era in which the national security state has only grown stronger , endlessly elaborating , duplicating , and overlapping the various parts of its increasingly labyrinthine structure . And keep in mind that , in a structure that has fought hardto keep what it 's doing cloaked in secrecy , there is so much more that we don ’ t know . Still , we should know enough to realize that this ongoing process reflects something new in our American world ( even if no one cares to notice ) .\nIn The Age of Acquiescence , a new book about America ’ s two Gilded Ages , Steve Fraser asks why it was that , in the nineteenth century , another period of plutocratic excesses , concentration of wealth and inequality , buying of politicians , and attempts to demobilize the public , Americans took to the streets with such determination and in remarkable numbers over long periods of time to protest their treatment , and stayed there even when the brute power of the state was called out against them . In our own moment , Fraser wonders , why has the silence of the public in the face of similar developments been so striking ?\nAfter all , a grim new American system is arising before our eyes . Everything we once learned in the civics textbooks of our childhoods about how our government works now seems askew , while the growth of poverty , the flatlining of wages , the rise of the .01 % , the collapse of labor , and the militarization of society are all evident .\nThe process of demobilizing the public certainly began with the military . It was initially a response to the disruptive and rebellious draftees of the Vietnam-era . In 1973 , at the stroke of a presidential pen , the citizen ’ s army was declared no more , the raising of new recruits was turned over to advertising agencies ( a preview of the privatization of the state to come ) , and the public was sent home , never again to meddle in military affairs . Since 2001 , that form of demobilization has been etched in stone and transformed into a way of life in the name of the “ safety ” and “ security ” of the public .\nSince then , “ we the people ” have made ourselves felt in only three disparate ways : from the left in the Occupy movement , which , with its slogans about the 1 % and the 99 % , put the issue of growing economic inequality on the map of American consciousness ; from the right , in the Tea Party movement , a complex expression of discontent backed and at least partially funded by right-wing operatives and billionaires , and aimed at the de-legitimization of the “ nanny state ” ; and the recent round of post-Ferguson protests spurred at least in part by the militarization of the police in black and brown communities around the country .\nOtherwise , a moment of increasing extremity has also been a moment of -- to use Fraser ’ s word -- “ acquiescence. ” Someday , we ’ ll assumedly understand far better how this all came to be . In the meantime , let me be as clear as I can be about something that seems murky indeed : this period doesn ’ t represent a version , no matter how perverse or extreme , of politics as usual ; nor is the 2016 campaign an election as usual ; nor are we experiencing Washington as usual . Put together our 1 % elections , the privatization of our government , the de-legitimization of Congress and the presidency , as well as the empowerment of the national security state and the U.S. military , and add in the demobilization of the American public ( in the name of protecting us from terrorism ) , and you have something like a new ballgame .\nWhile significant planning has been involved in all of this , there may be no ruling pattern or design . Much of it may be happening in a purely seat-of-the-pants fashion . In response , there has been no urge to officially declare that something new is afoot , let alone convene a new constitutional convention . Still , don ’ t for a second think that the American political system isn ’ t being rewritten on the run by interested parties in Congress , our present crop of billionaires , corporate interests , lobbyists , the Pentagon , and the officials of the national security state .\nOut of the chaos of this prolonged moment and inside the shell of the old system , a new culture , a new kind of politics , a new kind of governance is being born right before our eyes . Call it what you want . But call it something . Stop pretending it ’ s not happening . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "270": "Washington ( CNN ) - A growing number of Americans believe that senior White House officials ordered the Internal Revenue Service to target conservative political groups , according to a new national poll .\nAnd a CNN/ORC International survey released Tuesday morning also indicates that a majority of the public says the controversy , which involves increased IRS scrutiny of tea party and other conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status , is very important to the nation .\nRepublicans argue that the Obama administration used the IRS to intimidate and harass political opponents . Democrats say poor management at the tax agency , rather than political bias , is to blame . Congressional sources on both sides say that interviews with IRS workers so far have found no evidence of political dealings by the White House . White House Press Secretary Jay Carney , touting an independent IRS inspector general report , has said the scrutiny appears to have originated with `` IRS officials in Cincinnati , '' where the agency 's tax exempt division is centered .\nLast month only 37 % of the public thought that the IRS controversy led to the White House , with 55 % saying that agency officials acted on their own without direct orders from Washington . Now the number who say the White House directed that IRS program has increased 10 points , to 47 % , virtually the same as the 49 % who believe the IRS agents acted on their own .\n`` Younger Americans are much less likely than older Americans to believe in White House involvement , and there is , not surprisingly , a partisan divide as well , '' says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland . `` But the Obama administration may be losing independents on this matter . In May , only 36 % felt the White House ordered the IRS to target conservative groups ; now that number has crossed the 50 % threshold . ''\nFifty-one percent of those questioned said the IRS controversy is a very important issue to the nation , compared to 55 % who felt that way in May . In the past week and a half , the IRS story has been put a bit on the backburner , as the controversy over the federal government 's massive surveillance program has dominated the spotlight .\nThe poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International June 11-13 , with 1,014 adults nationwide questioned by telephone . The survey 's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "271": "Colin Quinn Colin Quinn on race , comedy and political correctness : `` People should stop lying and pretending there 's a racial dialogue '' EXCLUSIVE : Colin Quinn tells ███ we need to talk about race -- but we might not be smart enough to pull it off\nMaybe Colin Quinn is the last honest man . Or maybe he has a Twitter death wish . His new memoir -- `` The Coloring Book : A Comedian Solves Race Relations in America '' -- is smart , funny and brave . Quinn does n't just touch the third rail of race and comedy ; like Flick in `` A Christmas Story '' he puts his tongue right on it -- only no triple-dog dare is necessary .\nQuinn begins with what is almost a standard critique of politically correct culture : `` I 'm tired of humorless activist people decreeing that we only use these words and never those , and that we `` check our privilege , '' in case we say the wrong thing and `` trigger '' someone , '' he writes . `` Across the country , the sexist office asshole has been replaced by the flat-affect , dead-eyed , modern-day Puritan . Both groups -- the old-school assholes and the neo-Puritans -- share a common goal : to wipe the smile off everyone 's faces . ''\nBut the rest of the book is playing a subtler and more sophisticated game . Quinn wants to talk about race . He 's outraged that there 's no dialogue -- or that the dialogue veers only to the extreme poles of either angry or pandering . And he wants to tell his personal story of growing up in a multi-ethnic New York as an example of how people can get along when they talk openly with each other .\nHis frustration seems less with p.c . culture than with anything that stands between a problem and honest conversation about it . His real war is against papering over words and pretending we 've fixed a problem . This is a decent and no-bullshit guy . `` Maybe we need to admit the sad truth , '' he says , over coffee last week in lower Manhattan , `` which is that we are not smart enough to solve any of these things . '' Give this guy a Sunday morning talk show and you get the feeling he 'd unfreeze the conversation in a really provocative way -- or go down trying .\nWe spoke before Quinn 's good friend Jerry Seinfeld talked about `` creepy '' p.c . culture in interviews . Quinn 's take is more nuanced : That there has been political correctness on campus for decades , and that it 's the comedians ' job to make an audience uncomfortable and to think . He 's not a defender of the cheap provocation and understands that people can take offense at a joke , but he sees through easy outrage as well -- and sees it as getting in the way of really talking to each other . ( If you watched him on `` Fox and Friends '' yesterday deftly deflecting Steve Doocy and Elisabeth Hasselbeck , you only come away with more respect . )\nWe talked about all of this and more -- including his `` Girls '' colleague Lena Dunham , his thoughts on Bill Maher and religion , and memories of his years on `` Saturday Night Live . '' The interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity . And sorry , but the amazing story he told about Sam Kinison , `` Remote Control '' host Ken Ober , strippers , Las Vegas and cocaine came after we turned the recorder off .\nSo are you ready to be the most hated man on Twitter ? Comedy , race , humor , outrage – it ’ s a recipe for becoming a trending topic , or like Trevor Noah , landing on the front page of the New York Times . Why is this a third rail you want to leap on top of right now ?\nThird rail . I like that phrase . I don ’ t really know why exactly . It just feels like everything has always pointed that way to me . I ’ ve always been into discussing race . The conversation has been in neutral since I was a little kid . Since the ‘ 60s , it ’ s been in neutral . This conversation doesn ’ t exist . So at least people should stop lying and pretending there ’ s a racial dialogue . That would make me happy .\nAnd I like to joke . I don ’ t like how the climate has gone joke-wise . I understand totally when people are offended by jokes . I get it . I don ’ t like when people make blanket statements . For instance , the whole rape joke controversy . But nobody admits , nobody even discusses , that most rape jokes are made by female comedians .\nI don ’ t like comedy being determined by people who are not comedians . It was becoming a situation where whoever is the fastest typist decides what ’ s offensive and what ’ s not with comedy . It ’ s just too much . It ’ s too much . Don ’ t step in and start telling me what humor is . It ’ s like any job : Everyone wants to second-guess . I do the same thing to politics , to everything . Comedy has become that sort of thing – but with humorless people .\nWhy is it that everyone who second-guesses a joke is immediately branded humorless ? Sometimes what I see from comedians , watching this , is a defensiveness after being told , “ Hey , maybe that ’ s not funny. ” Or that a joke failed . Is it possible that comedians have their backs up in such a way that that ’ s stopping a dialogue that might be useful ? Because sometimes it seems to me that we are having a conversation about race and other topics when people say , “ Hey , I ’ m not sure that ’ s funny and let me tell you why. ” That leads to honest conversation – and maybe it is the joke that started the conversation .\nThere is no conversation about race . There is no conversation . That ’ s the first lie , that there is a conversation . All there is is a point of view that you are supposed to have -- and if you deviate from that point of view , people go , “ Whoa whoa whoa. ” That ’ s not what humor is .\nAnd punching up , punching down ! Once again , these terms were not created by humorous people . Activists are activists . They are great and a big part of American society . Humorists and activists don ’ t very often meld . Humorists and activists have two very different mentalities . Activists are very sincere , very positive . That ’ s how activists should be . Humorists are supposed to look at everything and see the bullshit in all sides . This is my opinion . We are not supposed to see 100 percent right and wrong . Everything is middle ground . Everything is hypocrisy in all people and all situations .\nI feel like people get on Twitter , and they get gripped by self-righteous indignation -- which is fine . It ’ s just not becoming in my opinion .\nPunching up and punching down . That seems like a fair point to me , keeping the target In mind . I ’ m not suggesting anyone impose rules on comedy , of course , or that anyone is off-limits for a joke . But it does seem like there ’ s humanity in at least thinking before making a punchline out of a victim .\nSo let ’ s say you make fun of a white plumber or Kanye West . Which is punching up and which is punching down ? Societally , historically , context is everything . That ’ s another annoying statement .\nBut if it ’ s Trevor Noah making a dumb fat joke on Twitter . That ’ s punching down .\nDoes that line of cruelty matter ? Or is it the comedians ’ job to poke through bullshit somehow free of someone turning around and calling bullshit on them ?\nNo . That ’ s what we would like to be , of course ! Ideally . I ’ d love it ! At the same time , what is the biggest argument ? It ’ s over free speech . Is Trevor Noah making a fat joke yelling fire at a crowded movie theater ? Then people go , “ We are not the government oppressing people. ” No , but if you still get people fired from their job , that ’ s also a certain amount of power .\nThere ’ s a difference between getting someone fired from their job and saying , “ That ’ s kind of an asshole joke . ”\nRight , but some people do get fired . Trevor Noah , some people wanted him to get fired . All I ’ m saying is there is a certain amount of power that comes on . It ’ s not just an average Joe Citizen . There are things that go on on social media in general . Let 's not pretend it ’ s just outrage . What the right-wing fundamentalists were throughout the history of our country from the time of the Puritans to the 1980s -- the left is becoming .\nI ’ m with you on about two-thirds of this : our frozen racial conversation , the lack of context and history from some in the politically correct crowd . And on the important role satirists and humorists play – imagine the Bush years without Stewart and Colbert . But F it . And the other piece of it that to me feels like people have the same First Amendment rights that Trevor Noah ’ s got to make that joke , to speak up and say , “ Not really funny . ”\nThe other side is people saying , “ Can ’ t you do better ? You are better than that. ” There ’ s so many lines to be drawn . The day any artist -- dare I call comedians artists -- but the day that anybody starts deciding that ( people can draw those lines ) how are we different from pandering , from the old idea that you have to please the crowd ? I thought the whole point was that you don ’ t please the crowd ; you please yourself artistically .\nLet me throw this out there . If you listen to the comedy podcasts , sometimes you can get the sense that comedians are trying to out-outrage each other . But then you also follow comedians on Twitter or read interviews , and it also sounds like there ’ s a lot of fear that if they say one wrong thing , their career could be ruined . Is there a chilling effect going on right now that is affecting writers ’ rooms ? Is all of this affecting the way comedians think and work ?\nOh yeah . I think so . I don ’ t have any particular examples of it , but a lot of people are scared of their career or that people will take what they say out of context or in context . It manifests itself across the board , but it ’ s interesting to watch these unspoken elephant-in-the-room situations that people accept . I said it 11 years ago on NPR . It ’ s called substitute shock . The audience wants to feel edgy . People don ’ t want to feel like Puritans . So people make disabled jokes , or rape jokes , or child molester jokes . But if you bring up race , there is a silence in the room . So it ’ s like where is this coming from ?\nI ’ m trying to be funny . That ’ s my goal . It ’ s definitely a weird time , as far as more and more things are being determined by people who don ’ t necessarily have a great sense of humor . It was bad enough when we had these asshole executives . It ’ s not even that I ’ m disagreeing with a lot of what people are saying ( online ) . I just disagree that they are pretending to be an average person . No . You are coordinating efforts all the time to stop people that are not necessarily harmful to the United States . First of all , if they want to say we are not going to have a discussion -- and that they believe in oppressing people and admit that -- I will feel better . “ I ’ m the kind of person that believes in suppressing thought I believe is offensive. ” Admit you are that kind of person . That ’ s all I mean . Let ’ s all put it out there . That ’ s why I think a racial discussion will be great . If we had a racial show every week it ’ ll bring it on board .\nSome of it . But if you want to bring it on board , let ’ s bring it on board . Like I said , racially , in terms of personalities , black and white in particular . This book all about black and white . There ’ s a chapter on every other ethnic group , but no one is going to care about anything except black and white . Either way , the fact is -- and it ’ s been in neutral since the ‘ 60s -- no interaction . People just want to change the subject . It ’ s just the way it is . And it ’ s probably never going to change . It hasn ’ t so far . But I just don ’ t like that people act like they are having these conversations .\nThese might be two different things . But so much of what gets written off as politically correct outrage culture is a really interesting conversation . The outrage over Bill Cosby , for example…\nYes , but those things are things . I ’ m talking about words . The Duggars , Cosby , those are actions . Not words . Neither of those is part of anything I do for a living .\nBill Cosby ’ s actions are rape . It ’ s not rape culture . It ’ s actual rape . I ’ m not saying there aren ’ t interesting behavioral things being brought up . I would never say that . But in the grand scheme of things , there ’ s still a thing going on -- since I started comedy -- where there is a tendency that used to come from fundamentalist , right-wing attitudes . Now it comes from the left . Mostly . If the right had cultural power , they would be doing it too , in a different way . ( Liberals ) are being Puritans . There ’ s no other way to describe it . All the things you are talking about I agree with -- except for the fact that the people making these decisions are starting minor digital hysteria .\nDigital hysteria . I want people to be honest and say , “ I don ’ t like it and we are going to put a stop to it. ” Admit it . I talk to people who monitor websites . And I ’ m like , “ Really ? That ’ s interesting . You fucking monitor with your free time ? ” This is what people do . That ’ s all I ’ m saying . When I was doing “ Tough Crowd ” we had racial discussions every day . We got nothing accomplished in the long run , but it was the beginning of something interesting .\nYou talk in the book about “ Tough Crowd ” getting you branded as a conservative and that hurting you career-wise .\nYou can ’ t prove anything , but I would say it did . Anyway , that discussion ended when it ended and it ’ s one of those things .\n( Blacks and whites ) got off on a bad foot , to put it mildly , and now it ’ s never going to be fixed . Either way , it ’ s fine if people don ’ t want to discuss it , but don ’ t pretend we need a race dialogue . There is none .\nThat ’ s what people say about absolutely everything . It ’ s like politicians saying we are going to have a blue-ribbon panel on something . It ’ s a way of acting like you are serious about something without actually having to do anything .\nOr maybe we need to admit the sad truth , which is that we are not smart enough to solve any of these things . None of us has solutions . Nobody has solutions to any of these problems .\nHow can comedians help ? The subtitle of the book is a comedian solves race relations .\nI don ’ t know if we can . Obviously when you discuss things with humor , interesting thoughts come out . People say interesting things with comedy -- not big consequential things -- but things I didn ’ t think of in a certain way . Ultimately , comedians aren ’ t going to solve the world ’ s problems , but it ’ s hard to say .\nI feel like we intuitively want to do this , but we are just not bright enough . It ’ s depressing , but we are not that swift .\nSo many of the stories in the book are about the way different ethnic and racial groups got along in New York when you were growing up in Brooklyn . As you describe it , people were really direct with each other and made jokes and knew how to get along . They maybe did n't like or trust each other , but they said so to each others ' face . Less so now , you suggest . So are things better or worse than they were when you were growing up ?\nThere was just as much racial tension in many ways . It wasn ’ t some idyllic thing . But , because Park Slope was so mixed , we were much more racially mixed . People aren ’ t racially mixed now .\nIn the ‘ 70s , maybe people had more hope . People now are hardened . I guess it wasn ’ t that different . It really wasn ’ t . We got along a little better because we were in close proximity . Like I said , everyone started to move away from each other in high school and that was a thing . It wasn ’ t because of an incident . There should be a once a week racial summit , but people would be afraid to say how they really felt .\nLena Dunham is back in the middle of controversy right now with Sarah Palin going after her and tying her into the Duggar scandal . You ’ ve been on “ Girls. ” Have you ever seen a young writer and actress be turned into a lightning rod like this ? Do you have any idea how she handles it ?\nI was just thinking about her today . She ’ s one of those people that seems like a “ light ” person . She ’ s always got a light to her , an energy .\nShe made the mistake of telling the truth . I made a whole routine about how when you ’ re little kids it can be like a Roman orgy . I noticed that a few people were shocked , but most people laughed .\nBut the right and the left , there is a war going on . It ’ s constant . It ’ s every day , everything . It ’ s terrible , but this is how ignorant we are . All it shows is our ignorance as a society . We ’ ve got these great technological things and people articulate better than they did 30 years ago , but it ’ s the same thing . People love to hate . People love to fight . You like to feel like you are on the right side of history , of things . It ’ s just terrible .\nSo the role for comedians is to be a reality check .\nExactly . In an ideal world we are a reality check . In the best of circumstances . That ’ s what we are supposed to be in an ideal world .\nYou write in the book that perhaps it ’ s OK to be a little bit racist . The example you use is of an older woman clutching her purse tighter if she sees a young black person . Explain that to me .\nIt depends on their experience as a person -- if she ever got robbed , if she got robbed by a black guy , she is going to clutch her wallet . It doesn ’ t make her racist . I saw so many people growing up that would be circumstantially racist and have black friends . And their black friends would tell them to watch out for the black kids when going down to a certain neighborhood . We knew it wasn ’ t everyone . Now , if you speak some kind of shorthand you are automatically racist .\nAnd like I said , if the past 20 years of whitewashing on language -- excuse the expression -- if that had actually had an effect of society ’ s racial ills , I guess I ’ d say it does work . But it ’ s bullshit . It ’ s just childish . It has nothing to do with people ’ s interactions . That ’ s just linguistic bullshit . That ’ s the problem . It ’ s getting to be another surface layout , another laminated layer of bullshit .\nTell me about “ SNL 40 ” and the moment where most of the Weekend Update anchors reunited . Not a lot of people have had that desk .\nIt wasn ’ t about the desk . It wasn ’ t about the show . It was about my memories of how much -- it ’ s all delayed reaction for me . Life is like delayed reaction . I was like , fuck , man . That was such a great time and I guess I sort of knew it . That ’ s how everything is in life . I sort of knew it then , but I was sitting there the whole night so overwhelmed by everybody that I worked with . Jesus . It brought back all these memories . It was like a high school reunion in the sense that it was really powerful . The show itself , it was fine . The power came from everyone in that room . It was very emotional for me .\nI was struck in the book that you sound very at ease with your years there . Sometimes people look back and they ’ re bitter .\nBut your take is interesting : You say that everything gets a shot on Wednesday in read-through . And if it can ’ t make a room of smart people and comedians laugh , well , it gets cut – but it had a chance .\nAt the time I didn ’ t appreciate Lorne Michaels . I was like everyone else . That ’ s the posture you take with anyone in charge of everything . Nobody else in show business would let you come that close to democracy . I don ’ t care who it is . Nobody in the history of show business . I look back wistfully because I wasn ’ t one of those people who went back . I should have , but that ’ s just my nature . When I ’ m done , I ’ m never thinking about coming back and doing a sketch . It ’ s not for me .\nBack to the book : What would you do , if you were in charge , to unstick the race conversation .\nIf there was a real show on every week where you can have these interactions , some of them funny , some of them serious , discussing black and white , that would be an interesting thing to do for a couple of years . To have forums . That would be good .\nOnly comedians . Political people have to be more careful than comedians because they really have to answer for the rest of their lives . With comedians it ’ s different , you are expected to be provocative . Provocative is part of the game .\nYou are supposed to have a little conflict with comedians . The worst insult in comedy used to be the crowd pleaser . That ’ s the hack . Sometimes the people that are attacking comedians are the very people that should understand that we are supposed to be a little provocative . I don ’ t excuse a lot of horseshit . I ’ m not trying to get away with something . Whatever I have to say , I will say upfront . I ’ m not trying to slip one by anybody . It ’ s a muddled line right now . Hopefully it will work out , but it ’ s a muddled line with social media .\nWhat do you think about what Bill Maher is up to with religion ?\nWith the Muslims ? Islam is a weird religion , but that being said there ’ s billions of Islamic people that don ’ t do anything wrong . But I have no problem with him saying it .\nIt ’ s direct . It ’ s not racially direct . If that was talked about in Europe , that would be an interesting show . There ’ s no Muslims here . If you do that show in France or England , that ’ s provocative .. It ’ s not our thing as much . It doesn ’ t feel like it to me at least . Maybe it is . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "272": "The FBI director is due to appear on Monday morning before a congressional committee which will ask him whether Donald Trump was wiretapped and whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow .\nRussia hearing live : FBI director Comey says no information to confirm Trump 's wiretap claims Read more\nJames Comey ’ s appearance in the House of Representatives , alongside intelligence chiefs past and present , will be a climactic moment in the investigation of Russia ’ s role in last year ’ s US presidential election , which has dogged the early weeks of the Trump administration . But it is unclear how many of the key unanswered questions will be resolved .\nOne of the first questions Comey is likely to be asked is whether Trump or his campaign was subject to a wiretap , as the president has repeatedly claimed over the past fortnight , without providing evidence . Comey is reported to have told members of Congress in private that there is no grounds for that claim and ABC News predicted on Sunday he would say so officially in the first few minutes of his testimony .\nIf so , it would be a striking repudiation of a sitting president ’ s claims by his own FBI director , coming on the heels of a heated denial from the British government and its electronic intelligence agency , GCHQ , that it had spied on Trump on the Obama administration ’ s behalf . That was a claim made by a Fox News commentator , which had been read out at a White House briefing by spokesman , Sean Spicer .\n“ I hope that we can put an end to this wild goose chase , because what the president said was just patently false , ” Adam Schiff , the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee , told the NBC ’ s Meet the Press . “ It ’ s continuing to grow in terms of damage , and he needs to put an end to this . ”\nIn a series of early-morning tweets on Monday , Trump claimed that the idea that he “ colluded with Russia ” was “ FAKE NEWS and everyone knows it ” and said that the former director of national intelligence James Clapper had said there was no evidence of such collusion . ( Clapper has said he has seen no evidence but it “ could have unfolded or become available in the time after I left the government ” . )\nTrump claimed that the Democrats had “ made up and pushed the Russian story as an excuse for running a terrible campaign ” .\n“ The real story that Congress , the FBI and all others should be looking into is the leaking of Classified information , ” he added . “ Must find leaker now ! ”\nComey will be joined at Monday ’ s committee hearing by Clapper , plus director of the national security agency Adm Michael Rogers , and John Brennan , the Obama administration ’ s CIA director .\nThe US intelligence community came to the conclusion in December that Vladimir Putin ’ s government had intervened in the election with the intention of skewing it in Trump ’ s favour . Comey and the intelligence chiefs will be questioned on Monday on the scope of that intervention and whether members of his campaign or any of his associates had colluded with Moscow .\nOn that explosive issue , there are less likely to be definitive answers . Counterintelligence investigations can continue for months or years without leading to a public conclusion or any arrests .\nThere is no question there were contacts between Trump aides and Russian officials , despite blanket denials of such contacts by the Trump camp . The administration ’ s first national security advisor , Michael Flynn , was forced to resign in mid-February over his communications with the Russian ambassador in Washington , Sergei Kislyak , and for failing to give an accurate account of them in public or to the vice-president , Mike Pence . The conversations were intercepted by US authorities and their contents leaked , demonstrating that they had discussed punitive measures imposed on Russia by the outgoing Obama administration , something Flynn had denied .\nFlynn is not due to appear before the committee , but the Flynn affair is certain to be covered . Another of the witnesses appearing on Monday will be Sally Yates , former acting attorney general , who is reported to have warned the White House in late December that Flynn was vulnerable to blackmail because of his contacts with Kislyak .\nYates – who was fired for refusing to defend Trump ’ s travel ban – will be asked about those warnings , which if confirmed will raise questions over why Trump and his team ignored them until the story leaked to the press and whether Trump authorised Flynn ’ s contacts , something he has denied .\nThe intelligence committee hearings will also provide an arena for a partisan clash between Schiff , who will seek to focus the hearing on potential Trump campaign collusion with Russia , and the intelligence committee ’ s Republican chairman , Devin Nunes , who wants to concentrate on the string of leaks from the intelligence agencies about the Trump camp ’ s Moscow contacts .\n“ That ’ s the only crime we know has been committed right now , ” Nunes said on Fox News Sunday .\nSchiff said that the congressional investigation into hacking had so far turned up “ circumstantial evidence of collusion ” and direct evidence that the Trump campaign aides had sought to cover up contacts with Russians .\n“ There is certainly enough for us to conduct an investigation , ” Schiff said . “ The American people have a right to know and in order to defend ourselves , we need to know whether the circumstantial evidence of collusion and direct evidence of deception is indicative of more . ” \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "273": "Washington ( CNN ) – Ahead of the release of his House GOP budget Tuesday , Rep. Paul Ryan previewed some of the plan ’ s key provisions , which he claims will lead to a balanced federal budget in a decade .\n`` On Tuesday , we 're introducing a budget that balances in 10 years - without raising taxes . How do we do it ? We stop spending money the government does n't have , '' Ryan wrote in an editorial published on the Wall Street Journal 's website Monday .\nSavings would come from a series of measures that have long been backed by Republicans . One is a repeal of President Barack Obama 's sweeping health care law , which continues to be implemented after being deemed constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court last summer . Ryan 's plan would replace the law with what he called `` patient-centered reforms . ''\nOne of those would be a major change to Medicare starting in 2024 , when Ryan 's plan stipulates seniors would have a choice of health care plans , including traditional Medicare . Seniors would receive support from the government toward paying their premiums based on their income level and health .\nIn the op-ed , he writes , `` Those in or near retirement will see no changes , and future beneficiaries will inherit a program they can count on . '' Ryan recently backed off a proposal to make changes to Medicare for people under the age of 57 - GOP aides said an analysis of the two-year difference showed it would not save the federal government a significant amount of money .\nIn his editorial , Ryan writes his plan would open government-owned land to energy development , and would include approval for the Keystone XL pipeline , a project that 's been delayed by the Obama administration .\nRyan also says mimicking the welfare reform laws of the 1990s on other federal aid programs would save money and reduce the number of Americans dependent on the federal government . And he adds that tax reform that closes loopholes and consolidates rates would help Americans save billions of dollars per year .\n`` Our opponents will shout austerity , but let 's put this in perspective , '' Ryan writes . `` On the current path , we 'll spend $ 46 trillion over the next 10 years . Under our proposal , we 'll spend $ 41 trillion . On the current path , spending will increase by 5 % each year . Under our proposal , it will increase by 3.4 % .

    "274": "( CNN ) - Today is the day lawmakers have known about since August 2011 : the day those forced federal spending cuts kick in .\nThis Friday is also a day many never expected would come . After all , the cuts known as sequestration were designed to be so draconian that lawmakers would be forced to compromise and avoid them .\nBut they haven ’ t , and as lawmakers left Washington to begin their weekend on Thursday , so left any prospect of avoiding the cuts that President Barack Obama and his administration have warned will lead to long airport lines and fewer air traffic safety controllers ; federal government furloughs and layoffs ; cuts to food inspection and border security programs ; and education funding decreases that will shut young students out of Head Start programs .\nFor all of the dire warnings , Obama acknowledged Wednesday that the cuts are “ not a cliff , but it is a tumble downward. ” He ’ ll set the cuts in motion on Friday with a stroke of his pen .\nHe is required to sign an order enacting the spending cuts by 11:59 p.m. Friday and will do so privately , White House press secretary Jay Carney said Thursday .\nBefore that happens , Obama and Vice President Joe Biden will meet with top congressional leaders : Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , House Speaker John Boehner and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi .\nBut Friday is seen by many as too late to reach a deal averting the cuts , especially with Congress out of town for the weekend .\nAfter Obama signs the order , the Office of Management and Budget will send to Congress a detailed accounting of the cuts – how much from which agencies and which accounts . Every `` program , project and activity '' has to be trimmed without regard for what it is , according to the OMB .\nThose who are employed by the government or rely on federal agencies ’ spending are expected to feel the effects first . From there , the effects of the sequester will ripple outward across the economy .\nThe Obama administration has said the law gives them no leeway to spare one budget line at the expense of another , and insiders expect the cuts to be about 9 % for nondefense programs and 13 % for defense accounts .\nWhat agencies do have some discretion over is how they roll out the cuts . In some cases , furloughs and other cuts could be backloaded , scheduling them to take effect at a greater rate later in the year in hopes that Congress will reach a deal to replace the sequester that has so far been elusive .\nOMB sent affected federal agencies a letter on Wednesday reminding them to prepare for the cuts . Some agencies have already given employees their official 30-day notice of upcoming furloughs . Others are expected to follow soon , and budget uncertainty has already caused some agencies to cut back .\nCongress delayed the cuts from triggering in January at the time of the fiscal cliff . The two month delay from January 1 to March 1 , however , made the cuts steeper than the original 5 % for nondefense spending and 8 % for defense programs .\nNot everyone is convinced these forced spending cuts are a bad idea . Some deficit hawks see them as one way to reduce ballooning federal spending and others who favor reducing military spending see their virtue , too .\nAltogether , the cuts will amount to some $ 85 billion dollars this fiscal year , which ends September 30 .\nWhile today means the end to one fiscal showdown , fans of Washington financial wrangling have another date to anticipate : March 27 . That ’ s the deadline for Congress to extend the continuing resolution that ’ s funding the government .\n- CNNMoney.com ’ s Jeanne Sahadi and CNN ’ s Gregory Wallace contributed to this report \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "275": "( CNN ) – Former President Bill Clinton , who signed the Defense of Marriage Act into law in 1996 , is now calling on the Supreme Court to rule the same law unconstitutional .\nThe law , which defines marriage as a legal union between a man and a woman , denies federal benefits to same-sex couples in the nine states where same-sex couples can now legally wed .\n`` On March 27 , DOMA will come before the Supreme Court and the justices must decide whether it is consistent with the principles of a nation that honors freedom , equality and justice above all , and is therefore constitutional , '' Clinton wrote in an op-ed published online Thursday night by The Washington Post .\nHe continued : `` As the president who signed the act into law , I have come to believe that DOMA is contrary to those principles and , in fact , incompatible with our Constitution . ''\nWhen it first became law , Clinton wrote `` it was a very different time . '' He added that many supporters of the bill believed its passage would `` defuse a movement to enact a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage , which would have ended the debate for a generation or more . ''\nUnder those circumstances , he wrote , the bill came to his desk , opposed by 81 out of 535 members of Congress .\nFast forward to 2013 , and the climate is much different . Nine states ( plus the District of Columbia ) have passed laws allowing same-sex marriage and public opinion polls shows a majority of Americans think it should be legal . According to a CBS News poll conducted last month , 54 % of Americans think same-sex couples should have the right to legally wed , while 39 % oppose same-sex marriage .\nLooking back , Clinton said he had hoped DOMA would not provide an excuse for discrimination . `` I know now that , even worse than providing an excuse for discrimination , the law is itself discriminatory , '' he wrote . `` It should be overturned . ''\nSame-sex couples who are legally married in the United States are still denied `` more than a thousand federal statutes and programs available to other married couples '' because of the law , he wrote .\nWhile he previously opposed same-sex marriage , Clinton went public in 2009 with a change of heart .\n`` I was against the constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage nationwide , and I still think that the American people should be able to play this out in debates , '' Clinton told CNN 's Anderson Cooper in September 2009 . `` But me , Bill Clinton personally , I changed my position . ''\n`` I am no longer opposed to that , '' he added . `` I think if people want to make commitments that last a lifetime , they ought to be able to do it . ''\nIn his op-ed , Clinton wrote that `` while our laws may at times lag behind our best natures , in the end they catch up to our core values . ''\n`` I join with the Obama administration , the petitioner Edith Windsor and the many other dedicated men and women who have engaged in this struggle for decades in urging the Supreme Court to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act , '' he wrote . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "276": "The Department of Justice filed a brief today in the case of a controversial California ballot initiative that defines marriage as between one man and one woman , asking the Supreme Court to affirm a lower court decision that struck down the measure , known as Proposition 8 .\nThe brief marked the first time that the Obama administration has come out in court against Prop 8 and the first time it has argued against state gay marriage ban before the Supreme Court .\nThe administration 's argument also could reverberate beyond California . If the Supreme Court accepts the arguments in the brief , it could lay the groundwork toward undermining laws against gay marriage in several other states .\n`` The exclusion of gay and lesbian couples from marriage does not substantially further any important governmental interest . Proposition 8 thus violates equal protection , '' wrote Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. in a `` friend of the court '' brief filed in favor of gay and lesbian couples challenging Prop 8 .\nNow that it has filed a Supreme Court amicus brief , the Obama administration most likely will be granted time to actually argue its position in front of the justices . When the government files an amicus brief in an important case , it is normally granted time to argue .\nA statement on behalf of ProtectMarriage.com , the proponent of Prop 8 , described the Obama administration 's decision to weigh in both `` unprecedented '' and `` hardly surprising , but nevertheless disturbing . ''\n`` In his first term as president , Obama clearly stated that Americans can choose a special designation of marriage between man and woman , and that supporters of traditional marriage can hold that position without animus , '' said the statement by Andy Pugno , general counsel for ProtectMarriage.com . `` He later remarked that it would be a 'mistake ' to make the debate over redefining marriage into a federal issue .\n`` Yet today , '' the statement added , `` by stating that the traditional definition of marriage is rooted only in irrational prejudice , the president has impugned the motives and actions of millions of Californians and turned his back on society 's long-standing interest in both mothers and fathers raising the next generation . ''\nThomas Peters , communications director for the National Organization for Marriage , another gay marriage opponent , invoked California 's voters in saying the group expected the court to uphold the law .\n`` NOM expects the Supreme Court to exonerate the votes of over 7 million Californians to protect marriage , '' said Peters . `` The president is clearly fulfilling a campaign promise to wealthy gay marriage donors . There is no right to redefine marriage in our Constitution . ''\nHowever , referring to proponents of the voter-approved measure who are defending it in court , Verrilli wrote , `` Petitioners contend that Proposition 8 serves an interest in returning the issue of marriage to the democratic process , but use of a voter initiative to promote democratic self-governance can not save a law like Proposition 8 that would otherwise violate equal protection . ''\nThe Obama administration brief noted that California extends all of the rights and responsibilities of marriage to gay and lesbians , but forbids them the designation of `` marriage . ''\nThat circumstance `` particularly undermines the justifications for Proposition 8 , '' Verrilli wrote .\nWhile the brief fell short of calling for a fundamental right to marriage under the Constitution , it suggested that if the court were to agree with the administration 's position , gay marriage laws in seven other states could be in jeopardy . Those states are Delaware , Hawaii , Illinois , Nevada , New Jersey , Oregon and Rhode Island .\n`` The brief pays closest attention to California and the other seven states that grant same-sex couples all the rights and responsibilities of marriage but insist on denying them the favored name , '' said Jane S. Schacter , a professor at Stanford Law School . `` But it advocates that the court adopt a much tougher , more skeptical approach to any state law that denies same-sex couples the right to marry .\n`` That approach is what lawyers call 'heightened scrutiny , ' '' she added , `` and if it were faithfully applied to all state laws banning same-sex marriage , it would result in the invalidation of those laws . The administration 's brief provides a blueprint for a national right-to-marriage equality , even though it does not advocate that in express terms . ''\nStephen I. Vladeck , a professor of law at American University of Law , called it the `` tip of a much larger anti-discrimination iceberg . ''\nAccording the brief , Vladeck said , `` states ca n't discriminate against gays without a really strong reason -- not just with respect to marriage , but adoption , employment , benefits and so on . ''\nToday , 39 states have laws restricting marriage to opposite-sex couples . This number includes voter-approved constitutional amendments in 30 states barring same sex marriage . Nine states allow gay marriage .\n`` The brief filed by the solicitor general is a powerful statement that Proposition 8 can not be squared with the principles of equality upon which this nation was founded , '' said Adam Umhoefer executive director of the American Foundation for Equal Rights ( AFER ) , the group behind the challenge of Prop 8 .\nRelated : Eric Holder Says Gay Marriage is the Next Civil Rights Issue \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

    "278": "Special counsel Robert Mueller is recommending a judge sentence one-time Donald Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos to up to six months in jail for lying to the FBI , a request that includes a strong rebuke of a man who allegedly failed to assist with the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections , according to documents filed with the court .\nInterested in Russia Investigation ? Add Russia Investigation as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Russia Investigation news , video , and analysis from ███ . Add Interest\nProsecutors did not make a specific recommendation but urged the judge to give Papadopoulos jail time and said a sentence within the guideline range of up to six months imprisonment was `` appropriate and warranted . ''\nThe government said he should be held accountable for having repeatedly misled them “ about critical facts , in an investigation of national importance , after having been explicitly warned that lying to the FBI was a federal offense . The nature and circumstances of the offense warrant a sentence of incarceration . ”\nPapadopoulos ’ wife Simona on Friday evening told the ABC7 Chicago I-Team that “ unfortunately they [ prosecutors ] didn ’ t value George ’ s cooperation. ” Simona Mangiante Papadopoulos said that federal authorities have ignored evidence favorable to her husband .\nPapadopoulos , who had served as a volunteer to the Trump team , traveled as an emissary from the campaign to foreign leaders in the Middle East and the Mediterranean . In July 2017 , he was charged with lying to the FBI about his contacts during the campaign with a professor who had “ substantial connections to Russian government officials , '' and accused of trying to conceal his contacts from the FBI .\nCourt records filed by special counsel Robert Mueller describe how the professor approached Papadopoulos after learning of his role in the Trump campaign . The court filing does not name the professor , but he has since been widely identified as Joseph Mifsud , then the director of the London Academy of Diplomacy . ███ has been unable to reach Mifsud for comment .\nThe professor told Papadopoulos the Russians had “ dirt ” on Democrat Hillary Clinton in the form of “ thousands of emails ” that they had procured , according to the court documents .\nPapadopoulos reportedly bragged about that offer to an Australian diplomat , who then tipped off the FBI and launched that agency ’ s counterintelligence investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia .\nPapadopoulos was arrested by the FBI when he arrived at Dulles International Airport in July 2017 and charged under seal . He agreed to cooperate with investigators in exchange for a lighter sentence .\nThe government ’ s sentencing recommendation includes clear signs the Mueller team felt betrayed by Papadopoulos after he struck a plea agreement and pledged his full cooperation .\nThe filing says Papadopoulos repeatedly withheld key details about his contacts with Russians and neglected to turn over the cell phone he used to communicate with Mifsud until the government expressly asked for it .\n“ His lies negatively affected the FBI ’ s Russia investigation , and prevented the FBI from effectively identifying and confronting witnesses in a timely fashion , ” the filing says . “ His lies were not momentary lapses . He lied repeatedly over the course of more than two hours , and his lies were designed to conceal facts he knew were critical : the importance of the information he received from the Professor , and his own communications and contacts with Russians and Russian intermediaries during the Trump campaign . ”\nThe filing also says that , even after his initial FBI interview , Papadopoulos made repeated attempts to land jobs with the fledgling Trump administration , including a high level post with the National Security Council .\n“ In the hours after being interviewed by the FBI , the defendant submitted his biography and a description of work he did on the campaign in an effort to obtain a position as a Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Energy Department , ” the filing says .\nPapadopoulos continued to deceive Mueller investigators during a critical period in early 2017 , when Mifsud was visiting Washington , D.C. , and could have been detained and questioned effectively . “ The defendant ’ s lies undermined investigators ’ ability to challenge the Professor or potentially detain or arrest him while still in the United States , ” it says . “ The Professor left the United States on February 11 , 2017 and he has not returned to the United States since then . ”\nPapadopoulos ’ s legal team will file their own sentencing assessment to the court in two weeks , and is expected to ask for probation .\nThe sentence recommendation comes as Simona Mangiante Papadopoulos has mounted the latest in a series of publicity campaigns – this one suggesting her husband has misgivings about his plea agreement .\nBack in December , in an interview with ABC ’ s George Stephanopoulos , she had described her spouse as the `` John Dean '' of the Russia probe , a reference to the Watergate-era former White House counsel who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to obstruct justice and became a key witness against President Richard Nixon and his aides .\n“ George is very loyal to his country , ” she said at the time . “ He is already on the right side of history . I think he will make a big difference . ”\nEarlier this month , Papadopoulos received a sealed sentencing document prepared for the court . After that , the defendant ’ s wife began an aggressive media blitz in which she strongly hinted her husband is considering changing lawyers and rescinding his plea deal .\nAfter appearing before Democratic members of the House intelligence committee earlier this summer , she said that Papadopoulos has come to believe the professor may have been working for Western intelligence agencies and set him up .\n`` I actually never said explicitly that it was an entrapment from the FBI . I just said that he definitely was ... the target of a different set-up , '' she said .\nIn June , the Daily Caller News Foundation reported that Simona Papadopoulos said , `` It looks to be one among a series of attempts to entrap George , '' adding , `` The question today to me [ is whether ] these people are simply shady businessmen or are they part of a greater attempt to entrap George in illegal activity . ”\nSince her husband ’ s guilty plea in exchange for cooperation with the Mueller probe , Papadopoulos has been living in Chicago .

    "280": "As New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie visits Iowa and New Hampshire , he continues to insist that if he does not get concessions from the state ’ s public workers his state will go bankrupt like Detroit . Back in the spring in an edition of his monthly radio show “ Ask the Governor , ” Christie challenged the Democratically controlled Legislature to undertake a second round of pension reforms to stave off the doomsday scenario of state insolvency .\n“ So until the Legislature can come to grips with the idea that to control property taxes , to control income taxes , to control sales taxes , and to provide services , we can ’ t continue to sustain a pension and health benefits system that is going to bankrupt us , '' he said . `` And if you need any proof of that , look at the City of Detroit — just went bankrupt — $ 11 billion in debt versus just $ 2 billion in cash , and of the $ 11 billion in debt , $ 9.5 billion was for pension and retiree health benefits . ”\nThere is only one problem : Under existing law and our federal system , New Jersey , or any other state , can ’ t go bankrupt . While such over-the-top rhetoric ensures the governor holds the spotlight , it brings more heat than light to a debate that needs less bombast and more finesse . It is much harder than just throwing up your hands and invoking the fiscal apocalypse . The reality is that the state , with or without Chris Christie , will have to sort this out politically , without the help of a federal bankruptcy judge .\n“ The states are sovereign entities . Each state has its own constitution , ” says Paul S. Maco , a partner with the law firm Bracewell and Giuliani . As Maco reads the law , making states eligible for federal bankruptcy would require an amendment to the U.S. Constitution .\nMaco is one of the nation ’ s leading experts on public finance and served as the first director of the Securities and Exchange Commission ’ s Office of Municipal Securities that led the SEC ’ s response to the 1994 Orange County bankruptcy .\nProfessor J. Fred Giertz , director of the University of Illinois ’ Institute of Government and Public Affairs , agrees states can ’ t file for federal bankruptcy protections . “ States do not have that option even though bankruptcy does allow an orderly process to insure equity in who gets paid and who doesn ’ t , ” Giertz says .\nTo be sure , the New Jersey public pension debacle pre-dates Christie ’ s tenure . Under governors from both political parties , benefits were expanded while the state regularly missed payments . Things happened that probably deserved the attention of a grand jury , but no consequences ensued except a slap on the wrist for the state . Back in 2010 the Securities and Exchange Commission took the unprecedented step of charging the state of New Jersey with materially misrepresenting the status of the state ’ s pension system in 79 bond offerings valued at $ 26 billion from 2001 until 2007 . Such an act of blatant fraud by a mere mortal would be an indictable offense . In Jersey , it was just part of our landscape .\nWhen Christie , working with Democratic Senate president Stephen Sweeney and former Speaker Shelia Olivier , produced the bipartisan pension reset , which raised the public employee retirement age , increased what workers paid in for their benefits as well as ended the robo cost-of-living increases , there was a sense the state could move forward by finding common ground and shared sacrifice . In the process the collaboration reduced the state ’ s long-term liabilities by $ 122 billion .\nBut this spring Christie invoked the Detroit bankruptcy scenario as political cover for his decision to renege on his pledge to contribute the full $ 3.8 billion to the public employee pension system that was the linchpin of the deal he cut with the Democrats .\nChristie cut the pension payment to $ 1.38 billion and used the balance to fill a budget gap that was the direct result of his own wildly unrealistic revenue projections .\nAs an alternative , Sweeney offered a budget plan that generated an additional $ 1.57 billion in revenue realized by raising taxes on the state ’ s wealthiest households and corporations while maintaining the pension payment as previously required . Christie dismissed it .\nIn Christie ’ s many national appearances and his reelection bid , he hailed the bipartisan pension reform package he negotiated as evidence that Trenton had something to teach a dysfunctional Washington . But when his own budget projections came in so short this year he felt it more important to reject any tax hike rather than keep his part of the pension reform deal . With that choice , Christie undermined his carefully crafted image as a transformational national leader the country so badly needs .\nThe fate of public employee pensions and their healthcare benefits must be part of the 2016 national conversation . While New Jersey is still looking at more than $ 100 billion in combined unfunded public worker benefit commitments , it is not alone . Most states are also struggling to meet these obligations . Only 15 states have remained current on making their required annual contributions toward their public employee pension systems , according to the Pew Charitable Trusts .\nIn a sobering 2013 report from the GAO , the fiscal picture for the states and local governments was projected to remain bleak through most of this century . “ That is , absent any intervention or policy changes , state and local governments would face an increasing gap between receipts and expenditures in the coming years , ” the GAO concluded .\nFor the states , unfunded pension and retiree healthcare liabilities loom large even as the federal government continues to reduce its role as a backstop with its robo cuts to domestic spending and local grants that in the past have helped the states get by . Experts concede it still is not clear what impact President Obama 's Affordable Care Act will have on the millions of public sector retirees . How much the states are in the hole for both unfunded pension and health benefits ranges from $ 1.5 trillion to $ 5 trillion depending on which nonpartisan think tank you reference . The key to divining these numbers are varying assumptions the fund managers make about the rate of return they will generate .\nState Budget Solutions , a conservative nonprofit think tank , assumes an annual rate of return of 3.225 percent -- which produces that scary $ 5 trillion number . The Pew Charitable Trusts uses the assumptions the states use , which can range between 7 to 8 percent .\nDozens of states have taken significant steps to reduce their long-term liabilities , but the hit they took in the Great Recession did structural damage that Washington is ignoring . The grim reality is that all these social contracts are coming due , whether with public employees or with future Social Security recipients , just as our corporations are figuring out how they can avoid paying U.S. taxes by incorporating overseas .\nChristie 's decision to not keep his part of the pension deal meant missing a unique opportunity to preside over a pension system turnaround . It could have been a template for a nation very much in need of one . He now says he will unveil another set of proposed reforms by the end of this summer .

And Rubio 's trip to Iowa comes a month after he traveled to New Hampshire , the state that holds the first primary in the race for the White House .\nOn the eve of the primary , Rubio joins Ernst at a early evening barbecue at her campaign HQ . And the two team up to talk to local reporters and join WHO 's Simon Conway , a popular afternoon/early evening drive time talk radio host . And Rubio 's Reclaim America PAC went up last week with a TV ad in support of Ernst , spending nearly $ 200,000 to run the spot statewide on cable TV , digital and radio .\n`` Excited to join @ joniernst tomorrow at 5:00pm at her campaign HQ – final push ! '' Rubio tweeted Sunday .\nErnst , who 's also a lieutenant colonel in the Iowa National Guard and who grabbed national attention earlier this year by touting her hog castrating skills in a campaign commercial , has the backing of some top names and groups among both the tea party movement and establishment Republicans .\nLast week , the political wing of the Senate Conservatives Fund , which often backs conservative candidates that launch primary challenges against incumbent Republican senators , and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , which mainly endorses mainstream Republicans , both went up with statewide ad buys in support of Ernst .\nFriday 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney campaigned with Ernst at two events in eastern Iowa . The state 's lieutenant governor , Kim Reynolds , teamed up with Romney and Ernst at those events . And while not officially endorsing her , longtime Gov . Terry Branstad is a supporter . And she 's also backed by the National Rife Association , which like the Chamber tends to support more traditional Republicans .\nBut she also enjoys the support of the political wing of Tea Party Express , a leading national tea party group , and former Alaska Gov . Sarah Palin , still influential with many on the right , also recently campaigned with her .\nErnst is facing off against three other major candidates in next Tuesday 's primary – businessman Mark Jacobs , former U.S. Attorney Matthew Whitaker , and conservative radio talk show host Sam Clovis . If no candidate cracks 35 % of the GOP primary vote , the nomination will be decided by around 2,000 delegates at a state party convention . A Des Moines Register poll released over the weekend put Ernst at 36 % , 18-percentage points ahead of Jacobs , who was in second place .\nThe GOP nominee will face off in the midterm elections against Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley , who faces token opposition in his party 's primary . The winner of November 's general election will succeed longtime Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin , who is retiring at the end of the year . If Republicans flip Harkin 's seat , and five other Democratic held seats , they will control the Senate .\nWhen it comes to the next race for the White House , it looks like Marco Rubio is n't laying low anymore .\nLast month he was in New Hampshire , sounding like a presidential candidate , as headlined the Rockingham County , Republican Committee 's annual `` Freedom Founders '' dinner , held at the historic Wentworth-By-The-Sea hotel just outside of Portsmouth . The senator slammed Democrats and in particular former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , who 's seriously considering a second White House bid , and if she runs would instantly become the overwhelming frontrunner for the Democratic nomination .\n`` Their ideas never worked in the 20th century , much less the 21st , and they 're threatening to nominate someone now who wants to take us to the past , to an era that is gone and is never coming back , '' Rubio told the audience .\nThe dinner was just one stop during a busy day for Rubio in the Granite State . Earlier , he headlined a fundraiser for the state GOP , held private meetings with some influential Republicans , and sat down for interviews with local media .\nRubio quickly followed his New Hampshire swing with an appearance on ABC 's `` This Week , '' where said that he 's ready to be commander in chief , `` but I think that 's true for multiple other people that would want to run . ''\nRubio added that should he decide to launch a 2016 presidential campaign , he wo n't run simultaneously for re-election for his seat in the U.S. Senate .\n`` It 's a completely wide open GOP field . None of our fruit is ripe : To move from long shot to frontrunner , every potential GOP candidate has to grow , develop , or overcome a debility and Marco Rubio has as good a shot at doing that as anybody at this point , '' said Alex Castellanos , a veteran Republican strategist and CNN contributor who last year founded NewRepublican.org .\nThe recent moves by Rubio put the first-term senator back in the 2016 spotlight , which he 's avoided for much of the past year .\nEarly last year Rubio 's name was near or at the top of public opinion polls of Republicans ' choice for their party 's 2016 presidential nomination . But Rubio 's numbers slipped after his high-profile support for a bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill that passed the Senate last June . The measure , which stalled in the House , included an eventual pathway to citizenship for most undocumented immigrants , which is strongly opposed by many conservatives .\nRubio 's numbers in 2016 polls quickly faded , and have remained in the single digits in surveys asking Republicans their choice for the party 's presidential nomination . Rubio stood in ninth place , at 6 % , in the most recent CNN/ORC International poll , which was conducted a month ago .\nMany of the other potential Republican White House hopefuls , such as Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky , Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas , 2012 GOP presidential candidate and former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania , Texas Gov . Rick Perry , and Louisiana Gov .

He was released on $ 250,000 bail and denies wrongdoing .\nMueller alleged in a long-anticipated indictment that Stone , 66 , was asked by Trump ’ s 2016 presidential campaign to get inside information about emails that were stolen from Democrats by Russian government hackers and passed to WikiLeaks .\nA senior campaign official “ was directed ” to tell Stone to find out what damaging information WikiLeaks had about Hillary Clinton even after it was reported that the material being published by the group came from Russia , the indictment said .\nThe allegations were the first to connect Trump ’ s campaign to the explosive release of the emails stolen by Russian operatives . Their release disrupted Clinton ’ s campaign and led the Democratic party ’ s chairwoman to resign .\nUS intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia ’ s interference was aimed at damaging Clinton ’ s campaign and helping Trump . Mueller is investigating whether any Trump associates coordinated with the Russian effort .\nAppearing outside the federal courthouse in Fort Lauderdale after his hearing , Stone smiled and said he would resist pressure from Mueller to turn on Trump . “ I will not testify against the president because I would have to bear false witness , ” he said .\nThe White House press secretary , Sarah Sanders , repeatedly declined to say if the order for Stone was given by Trump himself . Sanders claimed the charges against Stone , an early adviser to Trump ’ s campaign , had “ nothing to do with the president ” .\nRoger Stone 's arrest may renew threat of impeachment for Trump Read more\nBut Dianne Feinstein , a senior Democratic senator , noted that the phrase “ Trump campaign ” appeared 24 times in Stone ’ s indictment . “ It ’ s time for President Trump and his top aides to be truthful with the American people , ” Feinstein said .\nMark Warner , the Democratic vice-chairman of the Senate intelligence committee , said the new charges showed Stone ’ s activities “ happened at least with the full knowledge of , and appear to have been encouraged by , the highest levels of the Trump campaign ” .\nStone shuffled into court at 11am shackled at the waist and hands . Dressed in a blue polo shirt and jeans , he appeared disheveled after his 6am wake-up call from the FBI . Protesters gathered outside the courthouse in downtown Fort Lauderdale , some booing and waving “ Impeach Trump ” placards .\nThe indictment , which was issued in Washington DC , alleged that in June or July 2016 , Stone told senior Trump campaign officials that he knew WikiLeaks had damaging information on Clinton .\nJulian Assange , the head of WikiLeaks , first publicly hinted that the group had information to release on Clinton on 12 June , in an interview on British television . Two days later it was first reported that Russia had hacked Democratic computer systems .\nMueller said that after WikiLeaks began publishing the first leaked Democratic emails on 22 July , Stone repeatedly attempted to get to WikiLeaks through intermediaries , and then “ told the Trump campaign about potential future releases of damaging material ” .\nFirst he sent emails urging Jerome Corsi , a rightwing commentator , to get their mutual friend Ted Malloch , a London-based academic , to visit Assange at Ecuador ’ s embassy in London , where Assange has been holed up for more than six years . Corsi sent back what he said was inside information .\nThen Stone began messaging with Randy Credico , a friend and eccentric radio host who had his own connections to WikiLeaks .\nMueller said that on 1 October 2016 , Credico told Stone that there would be “ big news ” from WikiLeaks later that week . “ Now pretend you don ’ t know me … Hillary ’ s campaign will die this week , ” he said .\nOn 7 October , WikiLeaks began publishing emails stolen from John Podesta , the chairman of Clinton ’ s campaign .\nMueller said on Friday that soon after the first Podesta emails were published , an associate of Trump ’ s campaign boss Steve Bannon sent a text message to Stone that said : “ Well done. ” Stone took credit for passing on inside information in later talks with senior Trump campaign staff , Mueller said .\nAlthough Stone did not hold an official position for much of Trump ’ s 2016 campaign , he is perhaps the president ’ s longest-serving informal political adviser , stemming from a close association in New York spanning more than a decade .\nStone has attracted intense scrutiny from Mueller and other investigators , after a tweet and other public statements he made in the summer of 2016 indicated that he had knowledge the emails stolen from Podesta would soon be released . Late last year he predicted he would be indicted .\n“ Robert Mueller is coming for me , ” Stone wrote to supporters in August . Stone denied wrongdoing and said he faced legal peril simply because he had advised Trump for several decades .\nA self-proclaimed “ dirty trickster ” , Stone has been a controversial figure in Republican political circles stretching back to the 1970s , when he worked on Richard Nixon ’ s notorious committee for re-election . He has a tattoo of Nixon ’ s face on his back .\nThe indictment also said Stone made false statements when questioned by the intelligence committee of the House of Representatives . When asked if he had no emails or other communications relating to WikiLeaks and the hacked Democratic documents , Stone allegedly said : “ That is correct . Not to my knowledge . ”\nIn fact , the indictment said , Stone “ sent and received numerous emails and text messages during the 2016 campaign in which he discussed ” WikiLeaks , Assange , and their possession of hacked emails .\nIt was Stone who first recommended that Trump ’ s team hire as its campaign manager Paul Manafort , his former business partner . Manafort has since been found guilty on eight counts of financial crimes and is said to have breached a plea agreement with the special counsel .\nManafort made his first court appearance in months on Friday as prosecutors and defence lawyers argue over whether he intentionally lied to investigators .\nMueller ’ s team say Manafort repeatedly lied to them even after he began cooperating last September .

    "284": "President offers no new solutions to government shutdown in first Oval Office address of his presidency\nDonald Trump has used the first Oval Office address of his presidency to stoke fears of illegal immigration , repeat dubious claims about his border wall , and offer no new solutions to the partial government shutdown .\nIn the type of made-for-TV-moment he relishes , Trump blamed criminal gangs and “ vast quantities of illegal drugs ” for “ thousands of deaths ” and faulted Democrats for failing to end the shutdown , now in its 19th day .\nTop congressional Democrats accused him of fearmongering , and using rhetoric “ full of misinformation and even malice ” .\n“ This is a humanitarian crisis – a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul , ” Trump told primetime viewers on Tuesday night , describing the situation at the border . He argued that the current immigration system allows “ vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs ” to prey on immigrants , especially women and children .\nThe Oval Office has typically been a projection of power used by presidents before him to address the nation at times of crisis or tragedy . In remarks lasting 10 minutes , Trump sought to make the case for a border wall – arguably the central promise of his short political career – and tried to imply the proposal had broad public support .\nHow bad is the US government shutdown and can it be resolved ? Read more\n“ Law enforcement professionals have requested $ 5.7bn for a physical barrier , ” he said . “ At the request of Democrats , it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall . This barrier is absolutely critical to border security . It ’ s also what our professionals at the border want and need .\n“ This is just common sense . The border wall would very quickly pay for itself . The cost of illegal drugs exceeds $ 500bn a year , vastly more than the $ 5.7bn we have requested from Congress . The wall will also be paid for indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico . ”\nFactcheckers have poured scorn on Trump ’ s assertion that the trade deal , a successor to Nafta , means that Mexico is paying for the wall . The Mexican government has always refused to do so . And following the address , critics were quick to point out that Democrats are against money for a border wall – whether steel or concrete .\nPlay Video 1:51 What does a government shutdown mean for the US ? - video\nNearly three weeks in to the shutdown , Trump did not offer fresh ideas to break the current political impasse and did not declare a national emergency so that he could bypass Congress , as had been speculated . Instead he said : “ The federal government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only : because Democrats will not fund border security . ”\nCalling on Democrats to pass a spending bill , he added : “ This situation could be solved in a 45-minute meeting . Hopefully we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security . ”\nOn an extraordinary night for US politics , the House speaker , Nancy Pelosi , and the Senate minority leader , Chuck Schumer , delivered a live rebuttal from the House speaker ’ s balcony hallway . Both adamantly oppose the construction of a wall and have urged Trump to reopen the government while talks continue .\nPlay Video 2:19 Democrats to Trump : 'End this shutdown now ' – video\n“ Sadly , much of what we have heard from President Trump throughout this senseless shutdown has been full of misinformation and even malice , ” Pelosi said . “ President Trump must stop holding the American people hostage , must stop manufacturing a crisis , and must reopen the government . ”\nSchumer added : “ We don ’ t govern by temper-tantrum . No president should pound the table and demand he gets his way or else the government shuts down , hurting millions of Americans who are treated as leverage .\n“ Tonight – and throughout this debate and his presidency – President Trump has appealed to fear , not facts . Division , not unity . ”\nThe New York senator said : “ Most presidents have used Oval Office addresses for noble purposes . This president just used the backdrop of the Oval Office to manufacture a crisis , stoke fear , and divert attention from the turmoil in his administration . ”\nThe White House countered those points on Wednesday by accusing Democrats of being in denial .\n“ He ’ s fighting for the protection and the safety of every American citizen , ” the White House press secretary , Sarah Sanders , said . “ If this is the face and the future of the Democrat party I think things are looking really good for Republicans . ”\nTrump has privately dismissed the address to the nation and his proposed visit to the border this week as pointless , according to the New York Times . In an off-the-record lunch with television anchors on Tuesday , he reportedly said he was talked into both steps by advisers .\nIn the run-up to the address , the White House had been caught in a series of falsehoods . At the weekend , Sanders claimed 4,000 known or suspected terrorists had been apprehended at the southern border . On Monday , Kellyanne Conway , the White House counselor , admitted that this was “ an unfortunate misstatement ” as most of the individuals had been stopped at airports .\nMeanwhile , Pence was questioned by NBC News on Monday about Trump ’ s claim that some former presidents told him a wall should be built ( all four living presidents have denied it ) . The vice-president replied : “ I know the president has said that that was his impression from previous administrations , previous presidents . ”\nThe president , who has threatened to keep the government closed for months or even years , will attend a Senate Republican lunch meeting on Wednesday , then visit the southern border on Thursday as he continues to wage a public relations offensive . The partial government shutdown is now the second-longest in history , affects more than 800,000 workers , and there is no end in sight .\nOn Tuesday night , immigrants ’ right groups again condemned Trump ’ s message . Lorella Praeli , the deputy political director of the American Civil Liberties Union , said : “ With tonight ’ s speech , President Trump chose to compound the chaos because he can ’ t convince the majority of Americans that their taxpayer dollars should fund his bogus campaign promise ...

    "285": "The horrific story of the unarmed Walter Scott 's death at the hands of Officer Michael Slager continues to reverberate . Aside from the incontrovertible evidence on the tape that the accused officer shot him in the back as if he were doing target practice , there has since emerged more tape of the traffic stop itself and audio of the officer speaking with his superiors on the phone raising even more questions about his state of mind at the time of the shooting . But as journalists have gone back and studied the officer 's record and found that he was previously investigated for taser abuse . And on even further investigation it was found that this jurisdiction is known as `` Taser town '' :\nUntil the eight shots heard ’ round the world , cops in North Charleston , South Carolina , were primarily distinguished by their zesty use of Tasers . As computed by a local newspaper in 2006 , cops there used Tasers 201 times in an 18-month period , averaging once every 40 hours in one six-month stretch and disproportionately upon African Americans . The Charleston Post & Courier did the tally after the death of a mentally ill man named Kip Black , who was tasered six times on one occasion and nine times on another . Black died immediately after the second jolting , though the coroner set the cause of death as cocaine-fueled “ excited delirium syndrome . ”\nIt 's important to note that Taser International has spent large sums convincing local coroners that this syndrome ( which primarily seems to kill people in police custody ) makes it the victim 's responsibility if they have the bad luck to die from being shot full of electricity with a taser . It 's not just illegal drugs in the system which can allegedly cause it . Adrenaline can as well . So if a person fails to remain calm in face of an arrest and finds the feeling of 50,000 volts going through their system to be stressful they have no one to blame but themselves if they die .\nThose who have been following the story of Walter Scott understand the significance of the taser . It 's not just that the officer evidently lied about Scott taking his taser , thus somehow justifying his using lethal force , or the fact that he appears to have tried to plant the taser next to the slain man 's body to cover his tracks . The man who filmed the shooting said this :\n“ I remember the police had control of the situation . He had control of Scott , and Scott was trying just to get away from the Taser . You can hear the sound of the Taser ... before I started recording . I believe he just wanted to get away from the Taser . ”\nIt 's not unusual for people to try to escape from a taser if they can . It is , quite literally , a torture device designed to force compliance with terrible pain . The people of Taser Town , particularly African American men , undoubtedly understand exactly what is going to happen if they find themselves in the custody of a police officer . Here 's one example of how it would likely go down , as reported by The Guardian :\nSlager is among three patrolmen named in a lawsuit filed by Julius Wilson , who said he was arrested after being stopped in his car in August last year . Wilson is also suing the city of North Charleston , the city police department and police chief Eddie Driggers . Speaking at a press conference on Monday , Wilson described Slager and his colleagues as “ bad , corrupt cops ” . He said : “ The use of excessive force or punishment to torture suspects is not something that should be tolerated by the North Charleston police department. ” [ ... ]\nWilson , who has a criminal record , said he was stopped on 25 August because his vehicle had a broken tail light . Scott , 50 , was stopped for the same reason on 5 April before fleeing and being shot dead by Slager . Wilson was stopped by an Officer Edwards , he said , who was joined 10 minutes later by Slager and an officer Clemens despite Wilson calmly “ making small talk and laughing ” . After refusing to step out until he was told why he was being arrested , Wilson claimed , he was forcibly pulled out of his vehicle by Slager and the two other officers . The three then “ forcibly restrained Wilson on his stomach on the pavement face down , ” the lawsuit stated . Despite Wilson “ not moving , nor resisting ” and lying with his hands above his head , the lawsuit claimed , Slager broke a silence among the officers by shouting : “ Watch out ! I ’ m going to tase ! ” He then allegedly “ shot his NCPD-issued taser into Wilson ’ s back ” . The lawsuit alleged Wilson “ writhed in pain from the electric shock ” . It said when Slager warned his colleagues he was about to fire his taser , “ Wilson was cooperating fully ” and allowing the two other officers to place his hands behind his back .\nTasers guidelines vary by department and jurisdiction , but generally their use is only considered reasonable when the subject poses a safety threat . Clearly , shooting an unarmed 50-year-old man when he runs from the taser is not one of those cases . The video of the Scott incident shows that Officer Slager is confused on that issue , to say the least . And it 's just as clear , based on that same standard , that nobody could ever claim such force is justified when presented with an unarmed suspect facing down on the ground , with his hands behind his back . Using a taser in that situation is simply a form of unofficial street justice , a little torture at the hands of the authorities to make a point . Tasers are not simply used in place of lethal force , and they 're not always used to force compliance . They are very often used as on-the-spot punishment by police who want to teach citizens a lesson .\nTake the now notorious California incident that happened to be filmed by a local news station , in which a man on horseback led police on a chase through the desert . When he fell from the horse , police swarmed and he very clearly laid down on his stomach and put his hands behind his back . Then the police beat the hell out of him and tasered him repeatedly . This footage has garnered widespread criticism because of the beating , and for good reason . It 's brutal , primitive behavior .\nBut you wo n't find many people expressing outrage about the electric shocks being administered to this man over and over again . Here 's a typical news report of the incident :\nIn video captured by cameras aboard a helicopter for KNBC , deputies gather around the man after he falls from a horse he was riding to flee from them . The video shows deputies using a stun gun on him and then repeatedly kicking and hitting him . KNBC reported that the man -- identified by authorities as Francis Pusok -- appeared to be kicked 17 times , punched 37 times and hit with a baton four times .\nAgain , if you look at the footage , Pusok was on the ground , face down with his hands behind his back before anyone tasered him or physically assaulted him . And yet the tasering is apparently considered a-ok. At the very least , it is n't mentioned as something that shocks the conscience the way the beating does.Perhaps this is because the searing pain of electro-shock does n't leave much in the way of a mark . But hideously painful it is . Yet for some reason , delivering this particular agony to a suspect is not something people reject when there is no danger to police or bystanders , and the suspect is compliant . But police do it routinely , and are rarely sanctioned for it .\nSome of this undoubtedly stems from the fact that popular culture has turned tasering into slapstick comedy . Movies and TV shows and countless Youtube videos portray it as a hilarious joke . `` Do n't tase me bro '' became as national catch phrase . But it 's not funny . Tasers can kill people . And regardless of what level of respect and compliance one thinks police are entitled to get from the public , they are not entitled to torture and punish citizens to teach them a lesson .\nWalter Scott ran from the pain of the taser and he was shot in the back numerous times for doing it . Francis Pusok was compliant and was tasered and beaten repeatedly anyway . It appears that such shootings and beatings , when captured on film anyway , are still considered beyond the pale in America these days . In both cases , officers will have to face some sanction for their behavior . Slager is facing a murder charge . It 's unknown what the California cops will face , but the FBI is investigating , so there may be some federal civil rights charges . It will be very interesting if any of the officers are charged with assault for using the taser .

    "286": "( CNN ) - The back-and-forth between Republicans and defenders of Hillary Clinton ’ s record as America ’ s top diplomat is flaring anew .\nOn Tuesday , a reporter asked agency spokeswoman Jen Psaki to `` identify one tangible achievement '' from a key project executed under Clinton 's leadership - the first audit of the State Department .\nThat review was aimed at identifying how the agency could become more efficient , accountable and effective at carrying out diplomacy and delivering aid worldwide .\n`` I am certain that those who were here at the time , who worked hard on that effort , could point out one , '' Psaki responded .\nThat answer drew a sharp response from the Republican National Committee , which said it was another illustration of what the GOP regards as Clinton ’ s lackluster record from her tenure as secretary of state from 2009 to early 2013 .\n“ It speaks volumes that the State Department is having trouble naming the accomplishments from Secretary Clinton ’ s tenure , '' RNC spokesman Jahan Wilcox said in a statement .\n`` Americans are quite familiar with Hillary Clinton ’ s role regarding Benghazi and the failed Russia Reset initiative , but they ’ re still scratching their heads on what exactly she accomplished as the secretary of state , ” Wilcox said .\nLater , the State Department provided a list of seven changes resulting from the 2010 audit . They included the reorganization and creation of undersecretary positions and the establishment of three bureaus aimed at countering terrorism , promoting American energy interests and helping civilian leaders of the agency prevent conflict and violence .\n“ Hard Choices , ” Clinton 's book about her years at the State Department , goes on sale June 10 , providing her with a chance to tout what she sees as her successes .\nIn the meantime , Republicans continue to try to fill the political vacuum with repeated criticism of her diplomatic record , which polls show is a positive with voters ahead of a potential 2016 White House bid .\nWhile Clinton stays relatively mum on the subject , the defense of her record at the State Department is left to her allies and Correct the Record , a spinoff of Democratic super PAC American Bridge . It was founded to deflect Republican attacks that might endanger a Clinton candidacy before she 's even decided whether to run .\nThe group points to a list of 11 achievements on its website . It credits her with restoring America 's leadership and standing in the world , building and maintaining a coalition to enact unprecedented sanctions against Iran , her role in a nuclear missile reduction treaty with Russia and her support for the raid that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden .\n`` And , yes , you can also find information on her implementation of ( audit ) -inspired reforms , including the integration of women into the secretary of state policy framework and ensuring our economic , energy , and environmental goals serve U.S. national security interests , '' senior adviser Burns Strider told CNN .\nBut without major achievements to point to , like progress on Mideast peace , and U.S.-Russian relations at a post-Cold War low despite her attempt to reset them , arguments for her accomplishments are modest .\nEven Clinton herself has struggled to clearly articulate concrete examples of her success .\n`` I really see my role as secretary , and , in fact , leadership in general in a democracy , as a relay race , '' Clinton told an audience at a recent event in New York when she was asked about her triumphs in that job . `` You run the best race you can run , you hand off the baton .

At the Newseum this morning , bipartisan budget-cutters Alan Simpson , a Republican , and Erskine Bowles , a Democrat , found out just how hard .\nProtesters interrupted the two as they sat onstage , being interviewed by Politico 's Mike Allen before a small crowd of Beltway interest-group staffers and a smattering of news cameras at a Politico Playbook breakfast-a usually quiet ( some would say stodgy ) event series with newsmakers in D.C .\nAs the interview began , a man rose in the front row to protest their suggested cuts to entitlement programs .\n`` Pay your fair share of taxes , '' the man shouted as Newseum security escorted him out . `` Pay your fair share .

    "288": "There is one mystery left to solve before the Supreme Court gathers to hear a challenge to Proposition 8 in late March .\nThat is : Will the Department of Justice weigh in on the case in favor of opponents of Prop 8 , the California ballot measure that defined marriage as between one man and one woman ? And what will it say ?\nHollingsworth v. Perry concerns the California ballot initiative , enacted in 2008 . In a brief filed with the court on Thursday , opponents of Prop 8 made broad arguments claiming that it is unconstitutional .\n`` Proposition 8 is an arbitrary , irrational and discriminatory measure that denies gay men and lesbians their fundamental right to marry in violation of the due process and equal protection clauses , '' the opponents said .\nThe brief was written by Theodore B. Olson and David Boies , who represent the American Foundation for Equal Rights .\nThey wrote , `` Because of their sexual orientation -- a characteristic with which they were born and which they can not change -- plaintiffs and hundreds of thousands of gay men and lesbians in California and across the country are being excluded from one of life 's most precious relationships .\n`` They may not marry the person they love , the person with whom they wish to partner in building a family and with whom they wish to share their future and their most intimate and private dreams , '' they added .\nThe arguments tackled more than just the ruling that struck down Prop 8 on narrow grounds specific to California 's history on the issue of gay marriage .\nThe language was sweeping : `` The only substantive question in this case is whether the state is entitled to exclude gay men and lesbians from the institution of marriage and deprive their relationships -- their love -- of the respect , and dignity and social acceptance , that heterosexual marriages enjoy .\n`` This badge of inferiority , separateness and inequality must be extinguished . When it is , America will be closer to fulfilling the aspirations of its citizens , '' they wrote .\nA month ago , supporters of Prop 8 filed their brief in the case . Read it HERE .\nWhile the administration will certainly weigh in on the other gay marriage case in front of the court -- a challenge to the federal law , the Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ) -- it has never filed a brief in the Prop 8 case because it was not directly involved .\nWhile the DOMA case challenges a federal law that denies federal benefits to same-sex couples who are legally married in their state , the Prop 8 case asks a much broader question : Is there a fundamental right to gay marriage under the Constitution .\nSolicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. is not required to file a so-called `` friend of the court '' brief in the Prop 8 case , but sources said the administration is considering the possibility at the highest levels . If it chooses to weigh in , it has to do so by the last week of February .\nIn San Francisco Wednesday , President Obama told ███ station KGO-TV , `` The solicitor general is still looking at this . I have to make sure I 'm not interjecting myself too much into this process , particularly when we 're not party to the case . I can tell you , though , that obviously my personal view is that I think that same-sex couples should have the same rights and be treated like everybody else . ''\nAt the White House briefing on Thursday , White House spokesman Jay Carney said , `` I think you have seen no expression from the president on the constitutional or legal aspects of this . He has an opinion , obviously , about Proposition 8 as policy , but we have no comment and nothing to say at this point about an issue that is properly looked at as a legal and constitutional matter over at the Department of Justice . ''\nBack in May , the president told ███ ' Robin Roberts that he had evolved on the issue of gay marriage and had come to personally support it . He seemed to suggest in the interview , however , that he felt the issue should be left up to the states .\n`` I continue to believe that this is an issue that is going to be worked out at the local level because , historically , this has not been a federal issue , what 's recognized as marriage , '' the president said .\nBut at the inauguration , he used much broader language : '' Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law -- for if we are truly created equal , then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal , as well . ''\nEven if the Department of Justice files a brief , it does n't have to get to the broad question . It could , for example , limit its arguments to whether the supporters of Prop 8 -- in the absence of California officials who have refused to defend it -- have a legal right to bring the case . Or , it could argue in favor of the relatively narrow opinion from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals .\nIn a conference call on Thursday , Olson urged the administration to step in .\n`` We very much would like the United States , in the form of the solicitor general , to file a brief , '' he said .\nOlson , who served as the solicitor general under the George W. Bush administration , added that the justices pay particular attention when briefs come in on behalf of the government . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "289": "Vote came a week after the 400-member house voted to override the governor ’ s veto of a bill to repeal capital punishment\nNew Hampshire , which hasn ’ t executed anyone in 80 years and has only one inmate on death row , has became the latest US state to abolish the death penalty when the state senate voted to override the governor ’ s veto .\n“ Now it ’ s up to us to stop this practice that is archaic , costly , discriminatory and final , ” said New Hampshire state senator Melanie Levesque .\nThe senate vote came a week after the 400-member house voted by the narrowest possible margin to override Republican governor Chris Sununu ’ s veto of a bill to repeal capital punishment .\n' A broken system ' : the conservatives against the death penalty Read more\nNew Hampshire ’ s death penalty applies in only seven scenarios : the killing of an on-duty law enforcement officer or judge , murder for hire , murder during a rape , certain drug offenses , or home invasion and murder by someone already serving a life sentence without parole .\nThe state hasn ’ t executed anyone since 1939 , and the repeal bill would not apply retroactively to Michael Addison , who killed Manchester officer Michael Briggs and is the state ’ s only inmate on death row . But death penalty supporters argued that courts will interpret it differently , giving Addison a chance at life in prison .\n“ If you think you ’ re passing this today and Mr Addison is still going to remain on death row , you are confused , ” said the state senator Sharon Carson . “ Mr Addison ’ s sentence will be converted to life in prison . ”\nCarson argued that New Hampshire has a narrowly drawn law and a careful , deliberative process to ensure innocent people are not executed .\n“ This is not Louisiana of the 1920s where Old Sparky was put on a flatbed truck and driven from prison to prison and people were executed . We are not those people , ” she said . “ That doesn ’ t happen here in New Hampshire . ”\nThe senate vote , 16-8 , was exactly the two-thirds majority necessary to override the veto . Twelve Democrats and four Republicans supported ending the death penalty , while six Republicans and two Democrats voted to keep it . The latter included Lou D ’ Allesandro , who represents the district in which Briggs was killed . He urged his colleagues to remember law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line every day .\n“ I can ’ t abandon these people , ” he said . “ These people are there for us . They ’ re there for us , and I believe strongly we have to support them . ”\nSununu , who vetoed the repeal bill surrounded by officers at a community center named for Briggs , said Thursday he was incredibly disappointed in the vote .\n“ I have consistently stood with law enforcement , families of crime victims , and advocates for justice in opposing a repeal of the death penalty because it is the right thing to do , ” he said in a statement .\nBut state senator Bob Giuda , a former FBI agent , said while he greatly respects law enforcement , the death penalty is at odds with his pro-life principles . He called execution a “ ghastly ” process and urged his colleagues to “ move our civilization ” past it .\n“ I think we ’ re better than that , ” he said . “ I choose to move our state forward to remove the death penalty . ”\nThirty states allow capital punishment , but in four of them , governors have issued moratoriums on the death penalty , according to the Death Penalty Information Center . Twenty states have abolished or overturned it . New Hampshire lawmakers have been considering and rejecting repeal efforts for the last two decades .\nFormer governor Joeanne Shaheen , a Democrat , vetoed a similar bill in 2000 . Another Democrat , former governor John Lynch , signed a bill in 2011 expanding the death penalty to cover home invasions in response to a machete and knife attack that killed a woman and maimed her daughter in Mont Vernon . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

    "291": "Something extraordinary happened in Congress before they took their month-long August break . No , not that they passed a bill , though that has become a rare feat these days . This Congress , so obsessed with the deficit that they imposed a spending cap on themselves , and vowed that no new legislation would ever pass without being paid for , did just that last Thursday . Moreover , the same Republican House that has taken several dozen votes to repeal Obamacare passed this deficit-spending bill to further fund the country ’ s only system of socialized medicine .\nHow did this happen ? Because when you support the troops , federal spending is magic spending that doesn ’ t count .\nThe bill , signed by the president last Thursday , seeks to reform the Veterans Administration , though you can make a credible case that the new spending represents an attempt to undermine it . We ’ re only talking about an infinitesimal sliver of the federal budget , $ 10 billion in new spending spread out over a couple of years . But if the government allows itself to spend in reaction to an emergency without having to pay for it , suddenly a whole host of options come into play . It overturns so many false ideas that have perniciously made their way into the mainstream over the past several years , from the virtues of austerity to the inadequacies of economic stimulus . And it exposes how anything that has to do with the military gets a free pass , one that should be extended to all kinds of worthy policies .\nUnder the legislation passed by Congress , the $ 10 billion will go toward vouchers that enable any VA patient who experiences long wait times or lives more than 40 miles from the nearest VA facility to access private medical coverage . Another $ 6.3 billion in the bill goes toward hiring more VA doctors , upgrading current VA health centers , and entering into leases with 27 major medical facilities across the country .\nThat $ 6.3 billion gets paid for internally with offsets from the VA budget . But Congress was taken by surprise , amazingly , at the cost of private medical care . The Congressional Budget Office scored the private coverage aspect of the initial bill as costing $ 35 billion between now and 2016 . According to CBO , covering private care would cost $ 25 billion just in 2016 , when the entire VA budget costs $ 44 billion annually .\nCongressional negotiators got their hands around the cost by turning it into a pilot program , with a fixed limit to the spending . And it will be worth tracking to see how long it takes for that funding to dry up when routed through the inefficient and wasteful private healthcare system . In reality , only 0.6 percent of VA enrollees ever experienced wait times over 90 days ; this was a political rather than a policy problem . And it ’ s worth noting that many veterans advocates would rather have more money put into the specialized VA system than into back-door privatization , especially if growing the private care benefit means eroding the VA .\nBut Congress still had the bigger problem of how to fund that $ 10 billion , with the clock ticking before the statutorily mandated August recess ( that ’ s right , Congress is obligated by law to go on vacation after July 31 ) . So in the end , they decided not to pay for it .\nThey would not be able to get away with that , politically , with virtually any other priority of the federal government . Spending for national parks , medical research through the National Institutes of Health , food stamps , housing vouchers , anything else you can name , would require an offset . The Budget Control Act attempts to prevent Congress from spending above a top-line number on the discretionary budget for the next several years . Sequestration , most of which remains in effect , cuts spending rigidly without allowances . Paygo legislation disallows spending without offsets ; efforts like the VA bill require a special vote to waive that statute . Not even unemployment insurance for the large segment of long-term unemployed workers can get by without an offset , which is why it has yet to be renewed .\nMost reasonable people would consider being unemployed for months on end an emergency . But Congress finds it hard to rouse itself even with respect to unquestioned emergencies . The same week that they were handing out $ 10 billion for private voucher coverage through the VA , Republicans in both houses of Congress rejected $ 650 million in spending for wildfires along the West Coast , even as more than a dozen continue to burn . They didn ’ t mind spending more than 15 times that on the VA without paying for it .\nThis kind of thing happens like clockwork every few months or so . Recall back in January , when the budget bill contained a loophole restoring military pension cuts while exempting the cost of that restoration from paygo requirements . In other words , then as now , military spending gets put in a separate category from everything else in the budget , freed from the strictures of budgetary politics .\nThe lesson here is that the only emergency spending that matters to Washington has to do with the troops . Bernie Sanders , the lead negotiator on the Senate side of the VA bill , said that “ Funding for veterans ' needs must be considered a cost of war and appropriated as emergency spending , ” just like supplemental spending for Iraq and Afghanistan . That ’ s true , but why not extend that out ? It ’ s not that I would hold soldiers to the same miserly standard as the rest of the budget , it ’ s that I would use the proper definition of the word “ emergency ” to describe all of our pressing national priorities , not just the ones that require guns and tanks .\nWhen a child ’ s family doesn ’ t have enough money for breakfast and lunch , that ’ s an emergency . When particularly flammable parts of the country catch fire because of the debilitating effects of climate change , that ’ s an emergency . When our fellow citizens have no shelter , no job and no hope of advancement , that ’ s an emergency . As a wealthy nation , we can organize our resources to accommodate whatever emergencies exist , without the false conceit of “ bankrupting ” the country . If you can spend on the military , you can spend on anything .\nIt ’ s incredibly likely that the VA back-door privatization measure will become permanent in future years . Once Congress starts spending on they military , they find it exceedingly hard to stop . Politicians make the military and its members a priority . I wish they had the same concern for the rest of our 300 million citizens . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "292": "Weeks after the midterms , several states face continued wrangling as GOP accused of undermining voters ’ will\nA month after the midterm elections on 6 November , several states continue to be convulsed by bitter partisan fighting in which Republicans are being accused of flagrantly undemocratic attempts to steal victory from the clutches of their Democratic rivals .\nThe most intense battle is playing out in Wisconsin , where Republican lawmakers are attempting a power grab that would strip key functions from the state ’ s incoming Democratic governor and attorney general . Opponents are denouncing the move , which sparked protests on Monday , as a blatantly undemocratic negation of the November election results .\nSimilarly contentious efforts are afoot in Michigan , where Democrats regained three important statewide positions in November – that of governor , attorney general and secretary of state . Instead of accepting the will of voters , Republican lawmakers are now seeking to reduce the control of those post-holders over campaign finance and legal proceedings involving the state before the Democratic victors take office .\nElsewhere , Georgia continues to be racked with disputes over claims of Republican voter suppression before Tuesday ’ s runoff election for the key post of secretary of state , while North Carolina is grappling with allegations of voter fraud in a close congressional race that remains unresolved .\nGeorgia does n't need another voter suppressor running its elections | Carol Anderson Read more\nWisconsin ’ s power play is attracting the most nationwide attention given the unashamed attempt by state Republicans in effect to reverse the outcome of the November ballot , in which all six statewide positions were won by Democrats , including the governorship . The Republican-controlled legislature is hoping to vote on Tuesday on 40 proposed amendments contained in five bills that would starkly weaken the remit of the incoming Democratic officeholders even before they take office .\nThe proposed changes would prevent the governor-elect , Tony Evers , and attorney general-elect , Josh Kaul , from honoring one of their central promises to voters in the midterm campaign : the pledge to pull Wisconsin out of a multi-state legal challenge to Barack Obama ’ s Affordable Care Act . The new legislation would also gut the state ’ s department of justice of several core functions , transferring them from Kaul ’ s office to the Republican-controlled legislature .\nThe incoming post-holders have decried their rivals ’ tactics as fundamentally undemocratic . “ It goes to the heart of what democracy is all about , ” Evers told reporters , saying the flurry of conservative moves was “ an embarrassment for the state ” .\nKaul told the Wisconsin State Journal : “ This is fundamentally inconsistent with how a democracy is supposed to work . If this passes it ’ s going to significantly impair the ability of the state government to function effectively next year , because if it passes , it ’ s almost certain to end up in court . ”\nShould the bills pass and end up for approval on the desk of the outgoing Republican governor , Scott Walker , they would bookend his eight years in office in an inferno of controversy . Walker started his governorship in 2011 by introducing the notorious Act 10 , which removed most collective bargaining rights from public sector unions , sparking mass protests at the capitol building in Madison .\nThose protests were echoed on Monday with a fresh round of unrest in Madison , with opponents of the power grab heckling Republican lawmakers with chants of “ Respect my vote ” .\nThe audacious effort to defy the will of voters is a direct repeat of the playbook first adopted by Republicans in North Carolina two years ago . In the wake of the 2016 elections , in which the Democrat Roy Cooper unseated the Republican governor Pat McCrory , GOP leaders staged a special session in which they pared down the governor ’ s executive powers three weeks before Cooper took office .\nThis November , Republicans in North Carolina tried further to water down the governor ’ s powers with two constitutional amendments that would have limited his control over appointments to the state judiciary and board of elections . The amendments failed at the ballot box , but had they passed one commentator for the Raleigh News & Observer noted they would have reduced the role to that of “ a potted plant ” .\nNorth Carolina is back in the news this week with a continuing investigation by the state ’ s elections board into an extremely tight House race for the ninth congressional district . The Republican candidate Mark Harris is narrowly ahead in the contest with about 900 more votes out of 283,000 cast than his Democratic opponent , Dan McCready .\nThe result has yet to be certified by the board , which is looking into irregularities over absentee ballots . Democratic voters in Bladen and Robeson counties , in the east of the state , have submitted affidavits stating that their absentee ballots were collected in unsealed envelopes by unidentified individuals .\nOne voter said she had handed over her unfinished ballot to a woman who said she would “ finish it herself ” .\nThe fallout of acrimonious elections on 6 November also continues to be felt in Georgia where a fierce battle is still being waged in a Tuesday runoff for the post of secretary of state , the office that controls the state ’ s electoral system . The Donald Trump-endorsed Republican candidate , Brad Raffensperger , was slightly ahead of his Democratic rival , John Barrow , in the first round .\nThe Georgia contest is being fought over the vacated seat of Brian Kemp , who won the governor ’ s race in November amid a storm of protest that as the then secretary of state , he presided over a slew of voter suppression measures .\nA political group supporting the losing Democratic candidate , Stacey Abrams , has launched a federal lawsuit challenging the conduct of the state ’ s midterm elections at every level .\nThe three states in the throes of partisan tussles are at the forefront of Republican voter suppression efforts . Part of Wisconsin ’ s proposed new legislation in the lame-duck session is a reduction in early voting days that has the potential to bring Republican lawmakers into direct confrontation with federal courts .\nWisconsin Republicans seek to hobble Democrats in lame-duck session Read more\nDemocrats were given a big boost in the November election by record turnout in Wisconsin in early voting , with some 565,000 taking advantage of polling stations being open before election day . Now the Republicans want to whittle down the time allotted for such voting .\nA similar effort to restrict early voting was ruled unconstitutional in 2016 by a federal judge , James Peterson , who found that the Republican scheme “ intentionally discriminates on the basis of race ” . Peterson concluded that the conservative leadership had been specifically motivated by a desire to place hurdles to voting in the way of the dominant black population in the state ’ s largest city , Milwaukee .\nHe wrote that the legislature ’ s goal was brazenly partisan : “ to suppress the reliably Democratic vote of Milwaukee ’ s African Americans ” .\nThe revival of restrictions exposes the Wisconsin legislature to possible claims of contempt of court . The liberal issue advocacy group One Wisconsin Now told reporters on Monday that it was preparing for legal action against the lawmakers depending on the outcome of the lame-duck session .\n“ Republicans believe they lost the November election because too many people voted here , and are trying to undo the results of the vote by taking power from the elected governor and attorney general , ” said Scott Ross , One Wisconsin Now ’ s executive director .\nHe added : “ We are a democracy only as long as elected officials don ’ t place themselves above the law . ” \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

Darrell Issa , R-California , subsequently voted to hold Holder in contempt last year .\nThe Justice Department filed the motion late Friday evening , asking the U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson to send the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C . Circuit . In September , Judge Jackson , an Obama appointee , allowed the case against Holder to proceed despite the administration 's request to dismiss the suit .\nThe motion argues that because Jackson 's ruling has `` potentially great significance '' in its ability to alter to the balance of power between the legislative and executive branches , the `` Defendant respectfully requests that this Court certify its decision for interlocutory appeal and stay further proceedings pending the disposition of that appeal . ''\nIn plainer language , they are arguing a higher court needs to weigh in on the case before it can proceed because the issue involved could affect the separation of powers in a `` momentous , '' and in their opinion , harmful way .\n`` The very experience of participating in such proceedings will cause harm–to the Defendant , the Executive Branch , and the separation of powers–that can not be reversed if the D.C . Circuit ultimately rules in Defendant 's favor on the threshold questions presented , '' the motion says . `` In light of the harm to the separation of powers that such an adjudication would entail , including the impact of such proceedings on the negotiation process between the political Branches–a process that has generally proceeded without judicial involvement since the inception of congressional oversight–Defendant 's jurisdictional objections should be resolved by the Circuit before this Court takes such a momentous step . ''\nJudge Jackson has yet to rule on whether it was legal for the administration to use executive privilege in the first place . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "295": "Donald Trump has bragged many times that his 2016 election victory was a result of his unique political genius , saying only recently , `` You know who got me elected ? I got me elected ! '' He is convinced that his instincts are infallible and that he speaks for the American electorate when he engages in his patented demagogic bigotry . He believes this is what brought him to the White House and is what will win him a second term .\nHe has little choice but to try . Even with a healthy economy and no new wars , he 's been unable to raise his approval ratings above the 45 percent or so that elected him . For all of the media 's insistence over the past few years that his victory was a result of `` economic anxiety , '' Trump himself knows better . He knows he can only replicate his 2016 fluke by activating the racist id of his following to its fullest in order to once again eke out a narrow Electoral College victory .\nNow that he has found the perfect symbols of all his voters ' racism , xenophobia , misogyny , and Islamophobia in the persons of Reps. Ilhan Omar , Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley , there will be no turning back . They are the living personification of everything he and his voters loathe : Hispanic , Muslim , African American , progressive women .\nTrump 's recent Twitter tantrum and the ensuing outrage over his supporters ' `` Send her back '' chant really should not come as any surprise . After all , he is the king of the `` birthers , '' who managed to single-handedly convince millions of Americans that Barack Obama was a secret Muslim foreigner trying to pass himself off as an American citizen and was , therefore , an illegitimate president . These are his political roots .\nAnd you can forgive his followers for chanting `` Send her back , '' since Trump repeatedly promised to send refugees and immigrants back to where they came from during the 2016 campaign . It was a staple of his campaign from the very beginning to refer to Syrian refugees as a possible `` Trojan horse . ''\nIn New Hampshire for the first time since he failed to correct a man 's rant about President Barack Obama being a Muslim , Trump was greeted by a few thousand cheering fans — and he was fired up . ... On the topic of Syrian refugees , Trump was forceful : `` I 'm putting people on notice that are coming here from Syria as part of this mass migration , that if I win , they 're going back ! ” He explained : “ They could be ISIS …This could be one of the great tactical ploys of all time . A 200,000-man army maybe , or if you said 50,000 or 80,000 or 100,000 , we got problems and that could be possible . I do n't know that it is , but it could be possible so they ’ re going back — they ’ re going back . ”\nOne of his favorite performances was to read the lyrics to a song called `` The Snake , '' which he saw as a parable for immigrants and refugees turning on the Americans who generously `` took them in . '' He brought that back as a greatest hit at CPAC last year :\nFrom the beginning of his campaign , he spoke of mass deportations of undocumented immigrants , citing ( without naming it ) the grotesque `` Operation Wetback '' from the 1950s as his model . In one Republican primary debate , he explained :\nLet me just tell you that Dwight Eisenhower , good president , great president , people liked him . I like Ike , right ? The expression . `` I like Ike . '' Moved a million and a half illegal immigrants out of this country , moved them just beyond the border . They came back . Moved them again , beyond the border , they came back . Didn ’ t like it . Moved them way south . They never came back . Dwight Eisenhower . You don ’ t get nicer , you don ’ t get friendlier .\nHe told the press that he would create a `` deportation force '' that would `` humanely '' remove these millions of citizens .\nIn other words , he has formerly claimed that the first African American president of the United States was really a foreigner and he 's been talking about `` sending back '' immigrants and refugees for years . So this latest salvo is n't original , although it 's the first time he has combined claiming that a black American is an illegitimate citizen with calls for the person to `` go back to where they came from . '' So in that respect he 's taken the demagoguery up a notch . But his fans are just following the familiar grooves of his call-and-response chants by using words they 've heard a hundred times before . When he said at his North Carolina rally that Ilhan Omar has `` contempt for hard-working Americans , '' they knew exactly what to do .\nTrump danced around the `` Send her back '' chant when asked about it on Thursday , saying he `` disagreed with it '' and claiming that he tried to stop it . ( He did n't disagree with it and he did n't try to stop it . ) This is par for the course with Trump . He throws out the red meat to his crowds and then pretends he does n't like the fact that they gobbled it up like a school of red-bellied piranhas . But he does n't keep up the pretense for long .\nYou will recall that when the eventually ubiquitous `` Lock her up '' chants first started he disavowed them , telling the media during a press conference :\nWhen I started talking about Hillary Clinton , the veterans who saw her 24 hours before started screaming , “ Lock her up ! Lock her up ! Lock her up ! ” They also screamed that , as you know , during the speech I made . The big speech . And I said , “ Don ’ t do that. ” Now , I didn ’ t do that for any reason . I really — I didn ’ t like it . And they stopped . Not one reporter said that I said that . They all said — they started screaming “ Lock her up ! Lock her up ! ” I said , “ Don ’ t do that. ” I think it ’ s a shame that they said it , but a lot of people would say that should happen . ”\nIt was n't long before he told his people that he was going to stop being so nice and when the chants started he began puffing out his chest and strutting around the stage like Il Duce . During the presidential debates , he famously told Clinton that if he were president , “ you ’ d be in jail. ” The chants continue to this day .\nI have every expectation that he will do the same with `` Send her back '' or any other chant his fans come up with over the course of the next year and a half . He believes that pushing this odious demagoguery is how he will win because it 's how he won before . In any case , he does n't know how to do anything else . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "296": "Exclusive : ambitious plan to campaign in EU elections would fall foul of laws in nine of 13 targeted states\nSteve Bannon ’ s political operation to help rightwing populists triumph in next year ’ s European parliamentary elections is in disarray after he conceded that his campaign efforts could be illegal in most of the countries in which he planned to intervene .\nThe former chief strategist to Donald Trump has spent months trying to recruit European parties to his Brussels-based group , the Movement , which he promised would operate as kind of a political consultancy for like-minded parties campaigning in the bloc-wide vote in May 2019 .\nBut ███ has established that Bannon would be barred or prevented from doing any meaningful work in nine of the 13 countries in which he is seeking to campaign , according to national electoral bodies and relevant ministries . Confronted with the findings , Bannon acknowledged he was taking legal advice on the matter .\n“ I ’ m not totally disagreeing with you , ” he told ███ in Paris . “ I think there is more flexibility in some areas . But there ’ s no chance we would ever break the law . ”\nFurther disclosures about Bannon ’ s operation to foment a Trump-style populist insurgency in Europe are revealed in a Guardian documentary .\nBannon ’ s intervention in European politics comes amid heightened sensitivity about foreign involvement in elections . Questions have been mounting over the scale of Russia ’ s influence over the 2016 US presidential campaign and the UK ’ s referendum to leave the EU .\nHowever , in an interview with ███ , Bannon rejected the comparison between his movement and meddling by foreign states . “ It ’ s very different from Russia , or Chinese , or other people trying to have influence , because I ’ m a private citizen , ” he said . “ I ’ m not associated with the White House . ”\nA former investment banker with a reported net worth of about $ 50m ( £40m ) , Bannon is personally bankrolling his European operation . He has pledged to spend millions of dollars to provide nativist and ultra-conservative European parties free access to specialised polling data , analytics , social media advice and help with candidate selection .\nBut officials working on electoral law and independent experts in multiple countries said this kind of assistance would be considered in-kind donations .\nProfessional services that have a monetary value and are provided by foreign sources are banned in France , Spain , Poland , Czech Republic , Hungary and Finland . In Germany and Austria , in-kind services must be valued and are included in the limited sums parties may take from foreign donors .\nIn October , Bannon told ███ he had already spent $ 1m of his money on polling he planned to provide for free to parties in seven European countries . He described it as the most significant and most expensive political polling ever undertaken in Europe , and said it would be used by political consultants with experience in data analytics to help target voters in the European elections .\nBy the time the elections conclude in May 2019 , Bannon estimated , the project would have spent between $ 5m and $ 15m . There are no other known financial backers to his operation , although he has repeatedly referred to other unidentified donors who are “ quite interested in what happens in Europe ” . Asked recently if any of his donors were Russian , Bannon replied : “ This will all be Europeans , ” he said . “ And me . ”\nBannon ’ s project was already in turmoil after parties he was courting in Sweden , Denmark , Finland , Austria , Poland , the Czech Republic and Germany indicated they will not join his project . He now faces the challenge of persuading prospective recruits that they will not risk sanctions for receiving help from a Brussels-based group bankrolled by an American .\nBannon insisted his operation was not failing and that he had time to recruit more parties . “ Some people may not ever admit they ’ re signed up until after the European elections , ” he said . “ I ’ m doing all the polling whether there ’ s a country officially in or not . I ’ m doing all the data analytics whether the country is in or not . ”\nThe scale of legal challenges facing Bannon ’ s operation emerged six weeks ago , when his partner , the Belgian far-right politician Mischaël Modrikamen , told ███ his own party was forbidden under Belgium ’ s electoral law from receiving contributions from the Movement . “ It is a bit frustrating for me , ” he said . “ I would have loved to have a godfather … a benefactor . ”\nA former corporate lawyer , Modrikamen confessed he did not know what electoral laws permitted in Germany , Italy or France , saying he was focused on recruiting parties to their operation . “ For me right now I ’ m focusing more on getting the members , ” he said . “ I ’ m a bit frustrated because I have no time . ”\nIn the weeks since , ███ conducted a review of the domestic laws in the 13 European Union countries in which Bannon and Modrikamen had signalled they wanted to operate . It revealed that parties in France , Finland , Belgium , Spain , Hungary and Czech Republic would risk sanctions for breaches of electoral law if they agreed to accept the assistance of the former Trump strategist .\nParties in Germany and Austria can only accept such small sums that his war chest would be useless . Bannon ’ s activities would be permitted in Denmark and Sweden , but the parties he wanted to recruit in both Scandinavian countries have declined his offers of help .\nThe only EU countries where Bannon has both willing partners and sufficiently lax electoral laws to allow him to boost party campaigns are the Netherlands and Italy .\nBannon has poured most of his efforts into Italy , which elected a populist coalition government this year . His efforts to recruit the anti-establishment Five Star Movement have so far been rebuffed , but he has succeeded in enlisting the interior minister , Matteo Salvini , the leader of the far-right League , and Giorgia Meloni of the smaller party Brothers of Italy .\nHowever , legislation being considered by the Italian parliament would prohibit foreign donations to parties in the country . Should it be passed into law as expected , Bannon ’ s grand European project would in effect be restricted to the Netherlands , where the anti-Islam MP Geert Wilders appears keen to cooperate .\nInformed about the findings of ███ ’ s research , Modrikamen said : “ There is certainly a problem , as you say , with contributions in-kind. ” He added there may have been “ some over-enthusiasm ” in Bannon ’ s public declarations about turning the Movement into a nonprofit to help with campaigning in the European elections .\nWhen the findings were relayed to Bannon , during a meeting in Paris last week , he conceded that the polling , data analytics , and help with social media he had promised far-right parties in Europe may turn out to be unlawful . “ We ’ ve got counsel looking at the same thing , ” he said . “ What we ’ re not going to do is anything that violates elections laws in those countries . ”\nWhen it was suggested that Bannon ’ s European project may be restricted to providing campaign help to one Dutch MP , he replied : “ It ’ s a start . ”\nHe added that if lawyers advised his operation was “ close ” to violating laws banning foreign interference “ then there ’ s no chance we ’ ll do it ” .\nConcerns about foreign influence on domestic elections have multiplied in recent months . In the US , the special counsel , Robert Mueller , is investigating the extent of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election , including possible collusion with the Trump campaign . Mueller ’ s team has interviewed Bannon four times .\nIn the UK , the National Crime Agency is investigating the former Ukip donor Arron Banks , after the Electoral Commission said there were reasonable grounds to suspect he was “ not the true source ” of £8m in funding to the Leave.EU Brexit campaign .\nEmails published by the Observer last weekend suggest Banks was keen to involve Bannon – a founder of Cambridge Analytica – in a scheme to raise US cash for his Brexit campaign as far back as 2015 . Neither Bannon nor Banks has responded to the report .\nIn his final interview before the Observer ’ s disclosure , Bannon , who spent much of October and early November campaigning for pro-Trump Republicans in the US midterms , insisted his intervention in Europe could not be described as foreign “ interference ” . “ I think it is very different , ” he said . “ I ’ m not doing this as a White House guy . I ’ m not associated with the White House , I ’ m not associated with the Republican party . ”\nAdditional reporting by Kim Willsher in Paris , Josie Le Blond in Berlin , Sam Jones in Spain , Angela Giuffrida in Rome , Shaun Walker in Budapest , Christian Davies in Warsaw and Robert Tait in Prague . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "297": "But there ’ s no reason to keep this up . For one thing , it doesn ’ t seem especially true . It can ’ t really be that we think Cruz has a sophisticated mind , given that the only thoughts he produces are angry pants-on-fire platitudinous drivel . Even those who lavish praise on his oratory seem to agree that his heat-to-light ratio nears the infinite , and that “ thoughtfulness ” and Ted Cruz can not exist in the same room . His only memorable quotes appear to be cheap jokes , and the most notable speech of his entire career is not his own , but Dr. Seuss ’ . Nobody who has witnessed a few minutes of Cruz ’ s piece of senatorial performance art would have thought to label him a thinker , were it not for the preexisting consensus that he is one .\nCruz likely finds all of this very pleasing indeed . In his interview with Toobin , Cruz quotes Sun Tzu , saying that “ every battle is won before it ’ s fought . It ’ s won by choosing the terrain on which it will be fought. ” In getting those who despise him to genuflect to his intelligence , Ted Cruz has already won one battle . Jeffrey Toobin may lace his piece with dismissive sneers , yet somehow he still contributes to the ever-growing heap of liberal respect for Cruz ’ s mental acuity .\nEven Ted Cruz 's critics seem to concur on one point : whatever else you might say about him , the man is very smart . Mother Jones magazine has called him the “ thinking man 's tea partier. ” Josh Marshall , in a mostly withering assessment , made the same obligatory concession to his being an “ incredibly bright guy. ” Jeffrey Toobin ’ s recent , ostensibly critical New Yorker profile of Cruz is full of quotes about his being “ the smartest guy in the room , ” his “ sophisticated ” constitutional views , and the “ extraordinary ” erudition of his senior thesis .\nCruz has become notorious for using distortive , misleading rhetoric that no sober-minded individual could apply . Cruz says Obamacare ’ s “ intent is to destroy the private insurance business , ” despite the fact that the whole progressive complaint about Obamacare is that it is a massive windfall to insurers . He says a campaign finance amendment attempting to rein in spending literally “ repeals the First Amendment. ” But even more alarming are the straightforward factual errors . He has mistakenly claimed that most premiums have risen under the Affordable Care Act and that states with gun control have the highest murder rates , among other elementary blunders that earned him a rating on PolitiFact of 10 falsehoods for every one truth .\nOne may respond that Cruz is shrewd and knows better , that these are calculated political lies by a devious plotter . But for a savant merely playing an imbecile on television , Cruz is strangely inept when it comes to policymaking . He has alienated all of his colleagues , and wants to revive the gay marriage fight at a time when it couldn ’ t be more unwise . His major act of strategic maneuvering over the government shutdown proved a colossal high-profile failure , the result of which was that as his name recognition improves , his favorability ratings actually drop . Even the Wall Street Journal has labeled him part of a “ kamikaze caucus ” that is dooming conservatives ’ prospects . If Ted Cruz ’ s misstatements are deft politicking rather than idiocy , then where , one might ask , are the successes ?\nUltimately , though , the most damning evidence against Cruz 's intelligence may actually come from his law school roommate and college debating partner , David Panton . “ Ted ’ s views today politically are almost identical to when I met him , ” Panton said . “ There ’ s nothing he says today that I didn ’ t hear in college. ” That assessment , spoken about anybody , should be convincing enough evidence for shallowness of mind . Can there be such thing as a learned person who has discovered nothing new since freshman year ?\nIn fact , the stories about Cruz 's younger days show the marks of someone profoundly insecure about his intelligence . Quizzing others as to their SAT scores , wanting to limit his law-school study group to graduates of the `` H-Y-P '' schools ( a charge Cruz has denied ) , an unrelenting and discomforting argumentative aggression : He ’ s missing only a Mensa application to complete the full package of desperate IQ-dork self-affirmations .\nOf course , a chorus of people from Cruz ’ s student years has vouched for his brilliance . No less a heavyweight than Alan Dershowitz has commented on Cruz 's precocity at Harvard . Now , one could somewhat unkindly argue that Dershowitz , too , has in his career relied on people ’ s confusion of credentials and bluster for depth of intellect . More to the point , though , is that the evidence put forth doesn ’ t support the claim . Nobody doubts that Cruz has the gift of gab , and can be formidable in an argument . But sophistry is not philosophy , and being the loudest , most driven , and most shameless guy in the room does not necessarily make one the brightest .\nAny definition of intelligence is destined to be highly contestable . Yet it is hard to imagine a plausible one that does not include large measures of critical thinking and self-scrutiny . As Bertrand Russell put it , it ’ s always a central problem that `` the stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt . '' Intelligence necessitates doubt , for doubt is the origin of wisdom . One whose mind is clamped shut can not be intelligent , and yet Ted Cruz does not in his life ever seem to have taken on board a single challenge to his worldview .\nIn fact , the consistent overgenerous assessment of Cruz ’ s brains may stem from a deeper problem with the values of the elite legal community . If Newt Gingrich is “ a stupid person ’ s idea of what a smart person looks like , ” Ted Cruz is a lawyer ’ s idea of what a smart person looks like . Jennifer Rubin at the Washington Post puzzled that someone she had been assured has a “ sharp legal mind ” could be so blisteringly lacking in common sense . But success in the legal world does not depend on common sense . Ambition and confidence can more than make up for it . Law schools pose as Socratic institutions , where preconceptions are left in tatters on the lecture-room floor , but in practice they reward sparring ability far more than reflection and careful scholarliness ( the haphazard , un-peer-reviewed world of law journals can attest to the legal academy ’ s prioritization of argumentative formalism over a sober-minded quest for enlightenment ) . A person with one or two core principles , and a ruthless willingness to bend any truth that gets in the way , can do very well for himself at law school . Certainly , this requires skill . But it would be a sad day for the progress of human knowledge if we called it intelligence .\nCruz 's outsize ambition means that this narrative makes a difference . So long as those who oppose him nevertheless dutifully incant praises to his intellect , Cruz has them right where he wants them . Josh Marshall summed up the opinion surrounding Cruz as “ Arrogant Asshole , Super Smart. ” But who cares about being called an “ arrogant asshole , ” so long as they admit you ’ re super smart ? Assholes finish first , don ’ t they ? That kind of consensus makes the haters seem petty and lets Cruz keep playing the scholar . The key is to admit what is obvious from a few minutes of listening to him . The man is arrogant , but he doesn ’ t actually seem very smart .\nIf the loveliest trick of the devil is to convince you he doesn ’ t exist , the most incontestably brilliant trick of Ted Cruz is to convince you of his incontestable brilliance . There ’ s no need to keep falling for it . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

Senator Tim Scott , the sole African American Republican in Congress apart from one retiring representative , is from South Carolina . According to a report by the Equal Justice Initiative , between 1877 and 1950 , 184 African Americans were lynched there .\n“ There ’ s no question that the impeachment process is the closest thing to a political death row trial , so I get his absolute rejection of the process , ” Scott said . “ I wouldn ’ t use the word lynching . ”\nThe White House claimed Trump had used the word innocently .\n“ The president has used many words , all types of language , to talk about the way the media has treated him , ” said deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley . “ The president wasn ’ t trying to compare himself to the horrific history in this country at all . ”\nBut others saw a clear and familiar political play . “ When the polls get tough , Potus turns to race , ” tweeted Julian Zelizer , a historian at Princeton University .\n“ Lynching ? ! ” tweeted the New York Time columnist Charles Blow . “ Sir , don ’ t you DARE invoke the darkness of America ’ s viciousness toward black people to defend your corruption . How dare you ? ! … ”\nAccording to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) , from 1882 to 1968 , “ 4,743 lynchings ” – that is , extrajudicial murders – “ occurred in the United States .

    "300": "Welcome to the GOP 's age of rage : Shocking new study shows how anger is fueling the Republican Party According to a new Pew Poll , Republicans do n't trust the government at all—even while they control almost all of it\nAccording to the latest Pew poll , Republicans are mad as hell and they 're not going to take it anymore . They are , as usual , deeply confused about what government does and what they want it to do , but whatever it is , they 're very angry about it . Thirty-two percent of GOP voters say they are mad at the government , while only 12 percent of Democrats say the same . According to Pew , among the truly engaged ( like those , say , who go to a political rally a year before an election ) , 42 percent of Republicans are angry compared to 11 percent of Democrats .\nBoth sides say you can not trust the government , but Democrats ' views do n't change depending on who is in the White House while Republicans are far more trusting of government when one of their own is president :\nIn Barack Obama ’ s six years as president , 13 % of Republicans , on average , have said they can trust the government always or most of the time – the lowest level of average trust among either party during any administration dating back 40 years . During George W. Bush ’ s presidency , an average of 47 % of Republicans said they could trust the government . By contrast , the share of Democrats saying they can trust the government has been virtually unchanged over the two administrations ( 28 % Bush , 29 % Obama ) .\nIt does n't appear , then , that despite their constant bleating about the predations of big government , this mistrust is truly a matter of principle with Republicans . Republican voters simply believe that government is the enemy unless Republicans are in charge of every bit of it . This famous quote by Grover Norquist in the wake of the 2004 GOP victory perfectly expresses how they believe government is supposed to work :\n`` Once the [ Democratic ] minority of House and Senate are comfortable in their minority status , they will have no problem socializing with the Republicans . Any farmer will tell you that certain animals run around and are unpleasant , but when they 've been fixed , then they are happy and sedate . They are contented and cheerful . They do n't go around peeing on the furniture and such . ''\nAnd while one might think that having majorities of governors and state legislatures , running both houses of Congress and a majority on the Supreme Court would make them hate the government less , without having control of every branch , they are convinced that they are an aggrieved minority who are losing at every turn : `` large majorities of both conservative Republicans ( 81 percent ) and moderate and liberal Republicans ( 75 percent ) say their political side loses more often than it wins . '' And heaven forbid they might compromise to get some of what they want . If they ca n't have it all , it 's not worth anything .\nNone of this is really news to anyone who 's been watching the presidential race unfold this year . The Trump phenomenon alone is enough to convince observers that while a large chunk of the Republican base is ticked off at just about everything -- especially immigrants , Muslims and President Obama . But what really makes them see red , and what Trump ( and to some extent Carson ) articulates the best , is the visceral loathing for what they call `` political correctness . '' ( That 's what what people used to call `` good manners '' or `` basic human decency . '' ) The social disapprobation against being rude and demeaning completely enrages them .\nSome conservatives openly defy any restriction on their God-given right to be puerile jerks :\n( Helen Keller jokes were considered gross and out of bounds even when I was a kid and that was long before the term `` political correctness '' existed . )\nRush Limbaugh , Mark Levin , Ann Coulter and Laura Ingraham come to mind as similarly infantile and crude . But mostly they are screaming mad . They are the leaders of the angry right who have been stoking the discontent of their audiences for many years , creating the subculture of right wing rage that is finding its political expression in the candidacy of Donald Trump .\nNo less than the Wall Street Journal made note of their influence and how they 've managed to turn it against the very establishment that helped create them :\nConsider the folks who regularly tune in to conservative talk radio . These listeners expect a steady diet of Obama-bashing , so it ’ s hardly surprising that not one surveyed for a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll in late October approved of the job Barack Obama is doing as president . That anger translates to how these Americans view the country as a whole . Some 98 % think the country is headed in the wrong direction , a view regularly reinforced on the airwaves by the likes of Rush Limbaugh , Mark Levin and other talk-radio hosts who don ’ t have much nice to say about GOP leaders in Washington , either . A decade ago , Republicans touted conservative talk radio as a foolproof medium to communicate directly with their most ardent supporters . Democrats and liberal groups tried to replicate that success by building their own left-leaning television and radio stations , with far less success . Now , the tables have turned . Republican leaders in Washington are under siege from their own activists , in part , because conservative radio hosts are almost as likely to rail against the party brass in Congress as they are to lament Mr. Obama ’ s failings in the Oval Office .\nThis is a switch from the days when Rush would have the whole Bush family on his show in 2008 so they could kiss each other 's rings :\nRUSH : What are ... ? ( interruption ) Interrupting for what ? THE PRESIDENT : Hello ! RUSH : Oh , jeez . The president ? THE PRESIDENT : Rush Limbaugh ? RUSH : Yes , sir , Mr. President . THE PRESIDENT : President George W. Bush calling to congratulate you on 20 years of important and excellent broadcasting . RUSH : Well , thank you , sir . You 've stunned me ! ( laughing ) I 'm shocked . But thank you so much . THE PRESIDENT : That 's hard to do . RUSH : ( laughing ) I know , it is . THE PRESIDENT : I 'm here with a room full of admirers . There are two others that would like to speak to you and congratulate you , people who consider you friends and really appreciate the contribution you 've made . RUSH : Thank you , sir , very much . Put 'em on . THE PRESIDENT : How you doing ? This is my swan song ? If this is all you got for me , I 'm moving on . RUSH : ( laughing ) No ! The show 's yours ; take as much time as you want . THE PRESIDENT : Well , I 'm just calling along with President 41 and the former governor of Florida . We 're fixing to have lunch here , and I said , `` Listen , we ought to call our pal and let him know that we care , '' for you . So this is as much as anything , a nice verbal letter to a guy we really care for . RUSH : Well , thank you , sir , very much . I 'm overwhelmed . I ca n't tell you how much I appreciate this and how much you 've surprised me . THE PRESIDENT : Well , that was the purpose of the phone call . RUSH : You succeeded . THE PRESIDENT : Good .\nThere was trouble in paradise even then , however , although the Bush family may not have been aware of it . You may recall that President Bush had tried to pass immigration reform and was thwarted by one of the earliest exercises of right wing muscle in Congress . Former Senate majority leader Trent Lott left no uncertainty as to who and what was to blame :\nComments by Republican senators on Thursday suggested that they were feeling the heat from conservative critics of the bill , who object to provisions offering legal status . The Republican whip , Trent Lott of Mississippi , who supports the bill , said : “ Talk radio is running America . We have to deal with that problem . ”\nThere 's nothing they can do about it . That `` problem '' continued on unmolested and ended up empowering the Tea Party right to create an obstructionist bloc in the House , destroyed the political career of the House Majority Leader last year and is now fueling the angry crowds who are showing up to cheer on Donald Trump as he eschews all human decency to `` tell it like it is '' in exactly the terms these talk radio folks are used to hearing it . And today , as then , racism and xenophobia are their main motivators .\nLike Limbaugh , Levin , Savage and Ingraham , Trump channels their anger and feeds it back to them . The Pew Poll reported :\nDonald Trump is viewed more favorably by the nearly one-third of Republicans and leaners who are angry at government ( 64 % favorable ) than by those who are frustrated or content with government ( 48 % ) . Other GOP presidential candidates ( Marco Rubio , Ted Cruz and Ben Carson ) also get higher favorable ratings among Republicans who are angry at government than among non-angry Republicans , in part because they are better known among the “ angry ” group .\nAnd if you want to know why establishment Republicans are so unwilling to challenge talk radio 's toxic spew and the political virus that grows from it , the Journal explains :\nRepublican presidential contenders would be unwise to write off this bloc ; roughly a third of Republican primary voters strongly identify with conservative talk radio , about 10 percentage points higher than the share of GOP primary voters who consider themselves moderate or liberal , according to the survey conducted by the Democrats at Hart Research Associates and the Republicans at Public Opinion Research .\nThere are way more of these talk radio acolytes than there are any other kind of Republican . They run things now . And they are livid -- - at least until the Republicans manage to control all of government and enact their agenda precisely as talk radio tells them it must be enacted . Then they might calm down . But I would n't count on it . Rage is their life blood now . They ca n't live without it . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "301": "Nobody really knows what Donald Trump ’ s supporters would do if the president really did stand in the middle of New York ’ s Fifth Avenue and shoot someone .\nFor now , the president has merely fired the director of the FBI and been saddled with a special counsel investigating possible links between his 2016 campaign and an alleged Russian effort to interfere in the election .\nAnd it ’ s very clear what most Trump supporters in one county in Pennsylvania think of that .\n“ It ’ s all bullshit , ” said Joe Conicelli , a merchant selling artisanal peanut butter at the weekly farmers ’ market in Bethlehem . Conicelli grew up in the area and said he had been with Trump “ all the way ” .\n“ Let the guy do his thing , then judge him , ” Conicelli said . “ The Democrats wanted him out three months ago , so what ’ s the difference ? It ’ s just bullshit . ”\nOver five months for our series The Promise , ███ has been interviewing Trump supporters in Northampton County , Pennsylvania , a former manufacturing giant and Democratic stronghold that voted twice for Barack Obama before falling for Trump .\nNo previous setback in the Trump presidency – not the fumbled travel ban , the stumble on health care reform or the fall of national security adviser Michael Flynn – had seemed to shake Trump support here , where many Democrats switched parties to back the only candidate that excited them .\nBut what about the avalanche of dire headlines that began with the firing of James Comey ? Trump may have famously claimed he could shoot someone and still not lose voters , but have the woes which beset him on all sides begun to challenge his most extravagant declaration ?\nIt ’ s plain sabotage , Trump backers said on Thursday , echoing a line put out by the president ’ s campaign machine earlier this week .\n“ They ’ re gon na pick on him because he won , ” said Sandy Emrich , manager of the Trolley Shop restaurant in East Bangor . “ The Democrats are making it that way . He didn ’ t do anything any other president didn ’ t do . ”\nEmrich was slinging plates around a table of regulars who could not have agreed more .\n“ Let the man do his job , ” said Jeffrey Manzi , a retiree . “ If there ’ s something wrong , bring it out . Bring it out . Otherwise let the man alone . It ’ s , like , non-stop . It ’ s crazy . ”\n“ As far as impeachment , I don ’ t believe it , ” said John Picard , a carpenter . “ No one has shown me any evidence at all . Nothing . Show me something . Show me the proof . Or get off his case . ”\n“ This Russian thing , I think that ’ s stupid , ” said Joan Hallett , who owns the place with her husband . “ We didn ’ t vote because the Russians tried to change our opinions . They don ’ t realize that the people were tired of Obama . And they wanted a change . ”\n“ If they ’ d leave him alone and quit contriving stuff against him , he ’ d do a hell of a job , ” said John Griffin , a retired elevator technician . “ If they get rid of this contrived stuff , he ’ d be a hell of a president . ”\n“ I mean if he goes to the bathroom , he did it the wrong way , ” said Anthony DeFranco , a general contractor . “ If he has two scoops of ice cream , they say he ’ s a pig . ”\nIt was above 90F and a day to look for shade . Russell Frantz , who said he was tired of politics , cooled his heels on a friend ’ s porch in Ackermanville . At at an estate auction in Bethlehem , about 40 people congregated under ash and fruit trees to bid a dollar or two apiece on old furniture , tools , baskets and scrap metal .\n“ I predict that Trump will be going down , ” said Sam Richie , 69 , a retired government worker , carrying a carton of motor oil back to his truck . “ He will be leaving office , literally in probably weeks or months . ”\nNorthampton voted for Trump by four points despite decades of voting for Democrats at every level of the ballot , thanks to the powerful steel union and the predominance of blue-collar industry . Those who went for Trump may be staunch , but this area has a tradition of Democratic support .\nIn his “ young and foolish ” days , Richie said , he had been a Republican , but his opinion of his neighbors who voted for Trump was low .\n“ Now they got what they bought , ” Richie said . “ The guy ’ s been nothing but a disaster from day one . He ’ s done everything that is repulsive in our society , and people are standing by him .\n“ He ’ s nothing but an orangutan . He has the mind of a four-year-old . ”\nThe crowd perked up when the auctioneer announced that the family of the deceased had authorized him on the spot to sell the three-bedroom brick and stucco farmhouse . “ Remember , homes are flying off the shelf in the Lehigh Valley , ” he said . The house sold in five minutes for $ 125,000 , after an initial bid of $ 106,000 .\nBreaking off from the surprisingly high-stakes bidding , Gene DeLong , an auction company employee , said of Trump supporters : “ They ’ re diehards . They ’ re diehards . ”\nDeLong described the political mood in the area before the election as “ violent ” .\n“ I went to the chiropractor one day , and he said , you know , yesterday a patient came in , a heavy man , a big man , he was crying , ” DeLong said . “ He said , ‘ I had a physical fight with my brother-in-law over the election . We fought ! ’ And he screwed his back up and he had to go to the chiropractor .\n“ This is my opinion . The faster they do away with the separate parties , the better off we will be . ”\nHere was a point of agreement between Democrats and Republicans . Suggestions to discard the two-party system sprang spontaneously from both sides .\n“ I think you need one party , ” said Picard , back at the diner . “ Just one , that ’ s it . You vote for who you want , and they do their job , or they get out . ”\nLarry Hallett , Joan ’ s husband , used to teach prophecy classes , in addition to many other pursuits . “ I ’ d like to see it work out to where he had some support from both sides , and everybody begin to come together , ” Hallett said . “ If that happened , Biblically , that would hold back antichrist for awhile . It ’ s as simple as that . ”\nIn Washington on Thursday , Trump called the investigation of his presidential campaign a “ witch hunt ” and said the appointment of a special counsel was a “ very negative thing ” that “ hurts our country terribly because it shows we ’ re a divided , mixed-up , not unified country . ”\nBut Trump supporters in Northampton County saw the special counsel as possibly a positive development , if the process served to lay the larger controversy to rest .\n“ I don ’ t think he was needed , but if it ’ s going to settle the issue once and for all , it might be worth it , ” DeFranco , the contractor who is also a township supervisor , said of a special counsel . “ But if they ’ re going to spend $ 40m or $ 50m on it like they did with Ken Starr back in the day , it ’ s just a waste of time . ”\n“ I hope he gets a lot of help from the Democrats someday , ” Picard , the contractor , said . “ We need this country to get back together . And it ’ s so far down a hole , we need for it to be taken out . And that man , I believe , can do it . ”\nAsked to mention any setback which they would count as a strike against the president , Trump supporters offered positive reviews , particularly on news this week that immigration and customs enforcement had apparently stepped up arrests .\nThe guy ’ s been nothing but a disaster from day one . He ’ s done everything that is repulsive in our society Sam Richie , retired\n“ I want – in all honesty I want all the illegals out , ” said Emrich , the manager . “ I want what ’ s given , my right to be an American – my right . I want to be first in line . If I need help , I want to be first , not somebody who doesn ’ t belong here . ”\n“ Why do people think that they are entitled to healthcare free ? ” said Griffin . “ Somebody ’ s got to go to work . ”\nPicard said the sudden support among Republicans in Congress for the appointment of special counsel to take charge of the Russian investigations was evidence of their weakness in the face of bad media coverage .\n“ They have to listen to their constituents , and their constituents are afraid , ” Picard said . “ The news is bad all the time , the guy ’ s never doing nothing right according to the news . ”\nBut as Trump sets out for his first global tour as president , leaving behind a sea of troubles , his supporters remain ready to defend and excuse him .\n“ He ’ s a human being . Little mistakes are made , different words are used – and everybody does it .

    "302": "By cutting funds for Head Start , sequestration has sent low-income children in some states home 10 days early . But the federal government 's inability to agree on a budget did n't prevent 2,800 Head Start leaders from attending a three-day conference in National Harbor , Md. , this week .\nChalk it up to the peculiarities of the sequester . In this case , it 's O.K . to cut classes for kids , but not O.K . to reallocate Training and Technical Assistance funds .\nNational Harbor is along the Potomac River , just over the border from Washington , D.C. ; it offers hotels , restaurants , shopping and a marina . The Office of Head Start held its second annual `` National Birth to Five Leadership Institute '' conference at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center . Rooms went for $ 224 per room per night , a rate set by the U.S General Services Administration ; according to Kenneth Wolfe , deputy director of Administration for Children & Families ' office of public affairs , the event 's total approved cost was $ 752,059 , not including the cost of the stay , meals and air-fare for the grantees .\nThe conference included seminars and lectures focused on teaching parents , educators and administrators to use data to improve programs . Head Start 's mission is to help low-income children from birth to age five develop socially and cognitively before they enter the formal education system .\nCommunity Action Partnership of Kern ( CAPK ) in Bakersfield , Calif. , sent four team members to the training .\nCAPK had to reduce the number of days they offer their program this year from 168 to 158 , two days below the national standard minimum . Next year they plan to operate 160 days .\nMark Corum , outreach and resource development manager for CAPK , said any day their children are n't attending Head Start is a detriment to both the children 's learning and the parents .\n`` Ideally we 're trying to help people with a safety net . You know , they 've fallen through the cracks , '' Corum told ███ on Thursday . `` It 's the total family that we bring and embrace and try to make them better . ''\nHe 's seen `` firsthand '' how the program has helped parents and children with achieve success in life .\nTo celebrate Head Start and protest the cuts , Massachusetts organizers are planning a parade on Boston Common for May 31 .\nThey `` [ h ] ope to … perhaps convince some folks in Washington that our children are as important as air traffic controllers and meat inspectors and that they should seriously consider rescinding this foolish sequester that is causing havoc with the lives of our most underprivileged families , '' John Drew , president and CEO of Action for Boston Community Development ( ABCD ) , told ███ in an email Thursday .\nREAD MORE : Pre-School for All : President Obama 's Pipe Dream or Possibility ?\nThe Boston-area Head Start programs considered cutting as many as 250 slots for children at the onset of the sequester cuts . They are continuing to figure out `` how many classes , children , teachers and parents will be left behind , '' when cuts go into effect for their programs in September , Drew said . Of their 650-person staff , ABCD sent two to the conference .\nSo how can programs facing a 5.2 percent decrease in their budgets afford to send staff to the national conference ?\nGroups are drawing from a section of their budget set aside for `` Training and Technical Assistance . '' Congress allocates funds for this separately from Head Start 's operating costs , and the Office of Head Start absorbed all of the TTA sequester cuts , so that grantee 's TTA budgets would remain intact .\n`` The Office of Head Start is committed to working with programs to ensure the provision of high-quality services continue during this challenging time of sequestration , '' Kenneth Wolfe , deputy director of Administration for Children & Families ' office of public affairs , told ███ in an email .\nTTA money can not be reallocated to cover operating costs without direction from Congress .\nSo while Vanessa Gibbons , director of Jackson County Civic Action Committee in Moss Point , Miss. , would rather use the money to continue giving her young students a safe place to go before their older siblings ' schools let out for the summer , she instead has had to cut her program 10 days short this year .\n`` They specifically told us we could not cut our training budget . Those dollars were not even in the equation . That would have made it easy . But that was not even an option , '' Gibbons told ███ .\nThe problem is similar to the one the Federal Aviation Administration faced , which led them to furlough workers and space out flights in a way that slowed air travel .

    "303": "It was unclear who Trump was directing arms race threats against , but he said he received a letter from Putin calling for ‘ collaboration on the international scene ’\nThe president-elect Donald Trump has stunned nuclear weapons experts by appearing to call for a renewed arms race on his Twitter feed and in a TV interview .\nTrump calls on US to 'greatly strengthen and expand ' nuclear weapons capability Read more\n“ Let it be an arms race , ” the president in waiting was reported to have told Mika Brzezinski , co-host of MSNBC ’ s Morning Joe programme , in an early phone call on Friday .\nAccording to Brzezinski he went on to say : “ We will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all . ”\nThe incendiary comment followed a tweet on Thursday in which Trump threatened to preside over a major ramping up of the US nuclear arsenal .\n“ The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes , ” he wrote .\nThe volley of remarks had Trump aides scrambling into damage limitation mode , but their efforts were powerless to neutralise the shock waves of alarm and bewilderment provoked by the president-elect ’ s remarks .\nThey appeared to fly in the face of 35 years of bipartisan US policy geared towards reducing the number of nuclear weapons around the world . Nuclear arms specialists were quick to cry foul .\n“ It is irresponsible and reckless for the president elect to be articulating future US nuclear policy in a tweet and on a morning news show , ” said Daryl Kimball , executive director of the independent Arms Control Association .\nHe added : “ Just the words have damaging effects . It invokes confusion and can stir hostility among our adversaries . ”\nIn tune with many of his Twitter-based pronouncements , Trump ’ s intervention prompted confusion about exactly what he was saying . One issue that remained particularly opaque was whom his threats of a renewed arms race were directed against .\nThe only world power that can match the 1,800 deployed strategic nuclear weapons the US commands is Russia , whose president Vladimir Putin has been showered with praise by Trump .\nOn Friday , Trump put out a statement in which he said he had received a “ very nice letter from Vladimir Putin ” and added : “ His thoughts are so correct . ”\nMore ominously , the president-elect said : “ I hope both sides are able to live up to these thoughts , and we do not have to travel an alternate path . ”\nA copy of a letter dated 15 December accompanied the statement , in the name of Putin and bearing the postal address “ Moscow , Kremlin ” . It was billed as an “ unofficial translation ” – the identity of the translator was unclear .\nPutin supposedly wrote : “ I hope that after you assume the position of the President of the United States of America we will be able – by acting in a constructive and pragmatic manner - to take real steps to restore the framework of bilateral cooperation in different areas as well as bring our level of collaboration on the international scene to a qualitatively new level . ”\nIt was unclear whether the release of Putin ’ s supposed letter was prompted by an exchange of remarks with Moscow on nuclear weapons . Earlier on Friday , Putin said at a press conference that “ if someone is stimulating a nuclear arms race it ’ s not us ” .\n“ We don ’ t violate anything , ” he said . “ We are in line with our obligations as to the number of our warheads . ”\nOn Thursday , Putin had gone further and said Russia needed to “ strengthen the military potential of strategic nuclear forces , especially with missile complexes that can reliably penetrate any existing and prospective missile defence systems ” .\nTrump ’ s unrestrained language stands in sharp contrast with the stance adopted by President Obama over the past eight years .\nThough Obama has struggled to deliver on his early promise to oversee a sharp reduction in the US nuclear arsenal , agreeing to a $ 1tn modernisation program over 30 years for the triad of air , land and sea delivery systems , he has consistently adopted the vocabulary of disarmament .\nIn 2013 , the White House worked with Pentagon chiefs to carry out a detailed review of the US nuclear capability . It concluded that the country already had a third more strategic weapons than were necessary to ensure nuclear deterrence .\nKimball said the findings of the 2013 review proved that “ from a military strategy and security standpoint , there ’ s absolutely no need to get into any arms race ” .\nTrump ’ s comments to MSNBC were revealed by the host Joe Scarborough , who like Brzezinski was presenting the Christmas-themed show while dressed in pyjamas and slippers , sitting in front of a roaring fire .\nHe said : “ Mica asked the president-elect while we had the opportunity … to clarify the tweet yesterday regarding the nuclear arsenal . And the president-elect told you what ? ”\n“ ‘ Let it be an arms race ’ , ” Brzezinski said . “ ‘ We will outmatch them at every pass . ’ ”\nTrump intervenes to sideline Obama over Israeli settlements Read more\n“ You can put that down as breaking news , ” Scarborough said .\nTrump ’ s pick to be the incoming White House press secretary , Sean Spicer , led the damage limitation push .\nHe told NBC Trump would not allow an arms race , because he would stop other countries from increasing their stockpiles of nuclear weapons .\n“ He ’ s going to ensure that other countries get the message that he ’ s not going to sit back and allow that , ” Spicer said . “ And what ’ s going to happen is they will come to their senses , and we will all be just fine . ”\nTrump , who also tweeted on Friday morning a complaint about his son Eric being forced to give up charity work over perceptions of selling access to the president-elect and his family , is spending Christmas at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida .

Less clear , experts say , is how close the secretive nation is to realizing its ambitions to threaten the mainland of the United States .\nAs rhetoric between the two nations has ratcheted up in recent weeks , residents of major west coast cities such as San Francisco , Portland and Seattle have begun to ask out loud : should they be worried ?\nAfter five nuclear tests in a decade , North Korea has already shown that it poses a nuclear threat to South Korea and Japan , roughly 80,000 American soldiers stationed in those countries , and to China , its nominal ally . But although Kim Jong-un has dramatically increased missile testing since he took power in 2011 , North Korea has yet to test an intercontinental ballistic missile ( ICBM ) that could cross nearly 5,500 miles of the Pacific .\nNorth Korea would need to overcome two feats of engineering to threaten the American mainland : a working ICBM system and a warhead for one of those missiles . Unlike shorter-range missiles , long-range missiles have multiple engines and flight stages , meaning North Korean engineers have to make rockets – and bombs – that can survive the violent vibrations of launch , the wrenching g-forces of flight , and the temperature changes of takeoff and re-entry from space .\n“ Producing a warhead that can handle all that is a challenge , ” said Joseph Bermudez , an analyst for 38 North , a thinktank affiliated with the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies . Although Kim has said he wants to test an ICBM later this year , Bermudez doubted the test would be a success .\nIn February , North Korea fired a medium-range missileinto the Sea of Japan , travelling about 300 miles . North Korea has also developed a missile with an estimated range of 2,200 miles , almost halfway to Hawaii , but so far struggled to launch it .\nUntil North Korea begins ICBM tests , it will be difficult to gauge the country ’ s capabilities , said Joshua Pollack , a senior researcher at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey , California .\n“ If they do get to the point where they decide to start a campaign of ICBM flight testing , that will allow them to work through the usual technical difficulties , ” he said , noting that they had an “ impressive ” record of solving problems . “ It will allow them in time , I ’ m confident , to create a reliable weapon . ”\nBut Pollack was wary about any timeline . “ They could flight test an ICBM today and it could work or it could take them a year or two , ” he said . “ I really hesitate to say anything about it . ”\nOther experts have offered cautious estimates , based on the rate of testing in the last six years . “ If everything proceeds as is , it ’ s likely by 2020 that they could have a system reaching the United States , ” Bermudez said . “ It should be viewed as an emerging threat . ”\nThey could flight test an ICBM today and it could work , or it could take them a year or two\nAfter the fifth test last fall , Siegfried Hecker , the former director of Los Alamos National Lab , the cradle of the first atomic bomb , gave a similar assessment . “ Left unchecked , Pyongyang will likely develop the capability to reach the continental United States with a nuclear tipped missile in a decade or so , ” he wrote in a post for 38 North .\nWhile North Korea can not hide its missile tests – even short-range tests are usually visible to satellites – it has performed nuclear tests in a tunnel system beneath a mile-high mountain . The secrecy means experts know relatively little about how small or sophisticated North Korea ’ s bombs are , or how many exist . Experts agreed , however , that North Korea probably has the means to fit a warhead to an ICBM .\n“ It ’ s within the range of their technical capabilities and competence , ” Bermudez said . “ That doesn ’ t mean they could easily or successfully do it . ”\nThe US has reportedly made it more difficult for North Korea to get missiles off the ground , with a series of cyber-attacks begun by Barack Obama . But government hackers alone probably can not stop North Korea ’ s ambitions , Bermudez said . “ It ’ s likely that any cyberwarfare campaign would not be able to stop either the nuclear program or the ballistic program , only delay it . ”\nDonald Trump vowed on Twitter earlier this year that Kim would not test an ICBM , and his advisers have not ruled out pre-emptive military action .\nLast weekend ’ s parade , the experts said , showed a natural arc in North Korea ’ s progress : a mix of propaganda , aspirations and actual progress , to take with a grain of salt . In the parade North Korea showcased two apparently new ICBMs , larger even than existing models already designed to reach the east coast of the US .\nNuclear war has become thinkable again – we need a reminder of what it means | Paul Mason Read more\n“ That does not mean it ’ s ready , that also does not mean it ’ s fake , ” Pollack said . “ You see a mix of old and new , some things not quite ready for primetime , others tried and true . ”\nHecker and Pollack have urged diplomacy to stall North Korea ’ s program , saying that Obama ’ s non-negotiating policy of “ strategic patience ” gave Kim time to develop ICBMs as leverage .\n“ The good news , if you ’ re worried , is first of all the North Koreans are not suicidal , they ’ re not going to just start a war , ” Pollack said , noting that the US had coexisted for decades with other nuclear rivals , Russia and China . “ So this is a familiar condition for us and I don ’ t think we need to get too worked up . ” \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

    "309": "In the wake of the horrific San Bernardino attack , it 's understandable that we would see a national outcry , with leaders and citizens alike demanding that something be done . After all , 25 people were shot , 14 of them died on the scene . It was a terrifying act of violence . But this is America . We have frequent mass killings in workplaces , clinics , movie theatres , classrooms , churches , public events and even on military bases . Some of them are perpetrated by delusional people in the grip of a mental illness , some are done out of rage , some for political and ideological and religious reasons and often are some combination of those things .\nWhen they happen , the country tends to divide along the familiar political fault lines . Since most of the carnage from these dramatic massacres is carried out with guns , the left always pushes for a restriction on the easy availability of firearms . And most of the time the right shrugs its collective shoulders and says that this sort of violence is the price we have to pay for freedom .\nBill O'Reilly best expressed this sentiment in the wake of October 's Roseburg , Oregon , massacre :\n`` It is our freedom that allows insane individuals to kill so many people . Guns are legal in America under the Second Amendment ... There is no rational explanation for all the carnage , none . And no public policy will stop it . ''\nIt 's like a hurricane or an earthquake , just something we must live with and then try to put the pieces back together when it 's over . Because we are free .\nThere is an unusual twist to this tiresome dynamic , however , when the perpetrators of this violence are motivated by Islamic extremism . Last week , the left reacted the same way as it does to all such events , with calls to restrict the easy access to guns like the ones the San Bernardino killers used . The right , on the other hand , rather than their usual blase acceptance of the unfortunate necessity of massacres in a free society , are hysterical demanding that the government step in and do something about it immediately .\nNow , they are not in agreement with the left on the gun regulation issue , that goes without saying . Their standard response to anyone who suggests that ending the easy access to the guns that shot 35 people might be one common sense way to make such bloodletting less common is total resistance , and it makes no difference who perpetrates the killing . This was demonstrated in the last few days in living color as Democrats tried to make the case that Republicans are so rigid and doctrinaire ( and in the pocket of the NRA ) that they would not even allow the government to stop suspected terrorists on the secret `` Watch List '' from buying guns . It 's a tricky argument since the Watch List is a civil liberties nightmare to begin with , but Republicans did manage to twist themselves into pretzels trying to explain why terrorist suspects have inviolable 2nd Amendment rights .\nBut that does not mean the right does n't have a lot of ideas about what needs to be done . The fact that this has been designated a radical Islamic extremist terrorist attack ( as opposed to the radical Christian extremist attack that happened the week before ) has galvanized them into action . Led by their presidential frontrunner , Donald Trump , they have a lot of ideas about what needs to be done .\nTrump has a colorful history of animus toward Muslims , having made quite a spectacle of himself four years ago as King of the Birthers , hiring detectives to prove that President Obama was n't born in the U.S. and insinuating that he is a secret Muslim . In this campaign , Trump first turned his nativist aggression against undocumented workers from Mexico but his hostility toward Muslims -- and the previously barely suppressed hostility of his followers -- has recently been on more prominent display . Ever since September , long before the recent brouhaha , he 's been saying that he would not only deny Syrian refugees entry , he would deport all the refugees who are already here .\nAfter the Paris attacks , he blathered the usual rightwing bromide , that all this would have been prevented if the victims had been armed . He added that he would bomb the oil fields in Iraq . And he suggested that much more draconian measures were going to be necessary :\n“ We ’ re going to have to do things that we never did before . And some people are going to be upset about it , but I think that now everybody is feeling that security is going to rule… And so we ’ re going to have to do certain things that were frankly unthinkable a year ago… ”\nWhen asked if among those `` things , '' he would consider having American Muslims register with the government , he said he thought it might be necessary .\n“ This morning they asked me a question . ‘ Would you approve waterboarding ” Would I approve waterboarding ? Yeah . And let me ask you a question ? I said , on the other side , they chop off our young people ’ s heads and they put ’ em on a stick . On the other side they build these iron cages and they ’ ll put 20 people in them and they drop ’ em in the ocean for 15 minutes and pull ’ em up 15 minutes later . Would I approve waterboarding ? You bet your ass I ’ d approve it , you bet your ass — in a heartbeat . `` And I would approve more than that . Don ’ t kid yourself , folks . It works , okay ? It works . Only a stupid person would say it doesn ’ t work.They ’ ll say , ‘ oh it has no value ’ , well I know people , very , very important people and they want to be politically correct and I see some people taking on television , ‘ well I don ’ t know if it works ’ and they tell me later on , ‘ it works , it works , believe me , it works ’ . `` And you know what ? If it doesn ’ t work , they deserve it anyway for what they ’ re doing to us . ”\nIt was hard to imagine how he could top that for shocking pathological malevolence . But San Bernardino has changed the campaign and Trump is the field marshall leading the charge . He went on Fox News last Friday and said , `` We 're fighting a very politically correct war . And the other thing is with the terrorists , you have to take out their families. ” He went on `` The O'Reilly Factor '' later that night and spelled out what he was talking about :\n`` Do you think the wives and the families knew exactly what was going to happen with September 11th ? Well I do , and I think they did . “ We have to be much more vigilant , and we have to be much tougher . We can ’ t allow this to happen : They take the wives , they put ‘ em on planes , they send ‘ em home . ‘ Let ’ s go home and let ’ s watch Daddy tonight on television knock down the World Trade Center ’ — there has to be retribution . And if there ’ s not going to be retribution , you ’ re never going to stop terrorism . ''\nO'Reilly asked what he meant by `` take out '' and Trump replied , “ you have to wipe out their homes where they came from . You have to absolutely wipe ‘ em out . It ’ s the only way you ’ re going to stop terrorism . You have all these cells all over the place. ” He added :\n“ I want to tell you they would suffer . They know what was going on . If you look at what happened with these terrorists , they put their wives on the planes — those wives knew exactly what was happening , the children , everybody knew . ”\nAsked how he knows that Trump replied , “ Because I know . Because that ’ s the way life is . Because I ’ m a realist . That ’ s the way life works . The wives knew what the husbands were going to do . ”\n( This claim that all the hijackers sent their families home before the attacks is just wild nonsense . )\nThat was Friday . On Saturday , at a rally in Iowa , he went further :\n`` They 've got all sorts of bombs , pipe bombs all sorts of crap all over the apartment , the mother did n't know anything ... [ rolls eyes ] `` I watched the sister of the guy last night on television and I 'm pretty good at this stuff and I watched her , she had the veil , the whole thing . And she 's talkin ' about the brother . First of all the brother was killed a couple of days ago , she 's not at all , she 's talking like , ( looks at his watch ) in fact `` I think I have to go now my time 's up '' , so matter of fact ... `` I thought she was lying so much . I 'm good at this . I thought she was a total liar . ( crowd cheers , some shouting `` yeah ! '' ) She lied about him . Oh `` she did n't know , oh she did n't know he felt this way ... `` She knew . And a lot of other people knew too . A lot of other people . ''\nYesterday morning he repeated it to Sunday morning hosts who did n't seem to find what he said to be terribly unusual :\n`` I probably do n't believe the sister , '' Trump declared in an interview with `` Face the Nation . '' `` So you would go after her ? '' host John Dickerson asked Trump . `` I would go after a lot of people and find out whether or not they knew . I 'd be able to find out . Cause I do n't believe the sister ... we have to stop terrorists , '' Trump explained . `` And the only way we 're going to stop them , in my opinion , is that way . You know , they say they do n't mind dying . I think they do mind dying . But I can tell you this . They want their families left alone . We have to stop terrorism . '' I would go after a lot of people and find out whether or not they knew . I 'd be able to find out . Cause I do n't believe the sister ,\nWhen he said , `` I 'd be able to find out , '' it does n't take much to imagine what he plans to do . After all , he had just said a week ago that he would bring back waterboarding , adding `` I would approve more than that . ''\nOk , fine . So it 's Trump and `` in your guts your know he 's nuts '' . But he is not alone . His crowds lustily cheer these comments and the rest of the GOP field is following in his footsteps .\nTed Cruz , now looking as though he 's about to overtake Ben Carson in second place and possibly Trump himself in Iowa , has n't been talking about `` taking out '' family members of terrorist suspects . But he is talking about using nuclear weapons :\n`` We will carpet bomb them into oblivion . I don ’ t know if sand can glow in the dark , but we ’ re going to find out . ''\nApparently concerned that Trump is going to unman him , Cruz issued this cri de coeur :\n“ We see Loretta Lynch , the attorney general , promising in the wake of this terrorist attack — does she come out and say , ‘ We ’ re going to track down the terrorists and kill them ’ ? `` No , she says prosecute anyone that has the temerity to stand up and speak against radical Islamic terrorism . `` Well , let me tell you right now , radical Islamic terrorism is evil . `` Mr. President , there is not a moral equivalence between radical Islamic terrorists and Christians and Jews . `` One has a philosophy from day one of murdering those who they consider infidels ; the other preach love and forgiveness and standing together as one humanity . `` And let me say beyond that in the United States , we will not enforce Sharia Law . `` And madam attorney general , if you wan na come prosecute me for executing my First Amendment rights , come and get me , I ’ m right here ! ”\nThe crowd roared with excitement at this bold show of incoherent rage and manly aggression .\nAccording to Trump and Cruz , making it a little bit more difficult for killers to get their hands on deadly weapons is impossible . But registration of Muslims , closing mosques , torture , `` taking out '' wives and children , carpet bombing civilians into oblivion and even possible nuclear war are now on the menu .\nUnfortunately , it 's almost certain that we will have more mass killing before the election next year , motivated by a variety of homicidal and suicidal urges and enabled by a culture awash in firearms . But unless it 's perpetrated by a Muslim extremist the Trump party will be too busy beating their chests and issuing bellicose threats to even notice . They have lots of lurid suggestions about how to exact retribution on our enemies but they have absolutely nothing to say about how to lower the body count in this country . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

    "311": "Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis will appear in federal court today to explain why she believes that God and her personal convictions empower her to break the law and deny gay people their constitutionally protected rights . Ever since this summer ’ s Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges , which legalized same-sex marriage nationwide , Davis has been refusing to issue marriage licenses – to any couple , gay or straight – citing her religious beliefs . She was ordered by the governor to do her job , but she refused . She was ordered by a federal judge to do her job , but she refused . This week , the Supreme Court rejected her appeal of the federal judge ’ s decision , which should have been the final word on the matter , but she ’ s still refusing to the job she was elected by the people of Kentucky to do . And so now she ’ s being hauled before a judge to determine whether she ’ s in contempt of court .\nThere is no debate on that question : Davis is flagrantly in contempt and should be punished for what she ’ s done . After the Supreme Court rejected her appeal , a gay couple confronted Davis and asked her to explain what authority she had to continue denying them their rights . “ God ’ s authority , ” she shot back , which is the absolute wrong answer for a government employee to provide . The Constitution is the governing power in Kim Davis ’ office , and she is bound by oath to adhere to the law . She is breaking that oath , defying the Constitution , abusing her authority , and insisting that she suffer no consequences for her behavior .\nDavis ’ illegal and morally dubious stand against gay marriage does appeal , however , to the slice of the conservative movement that is hell bent on restoring the good old days of godly virtue when you had the state ’ s blessing to discriminate against gay people . It just so happens that there are a number of Republican presidential candidates who are trying to motivate that highly politically active segment of the population to get behind their campaigns , and that ’ s led us to a situation in which people running for the nation ’ s highest elected office are cheering on a rogue government employee ’ s defiance of the Constitution .\nIf you were forced to guess which 2016 Republican candidate would line up behind Davis , you would of course choose Mike Huckabee , because Mike Huckabee is a crazy person who says things like “ the Supreme Court is not the supreme being , and they can not overturn the laws of nature or of nature ’ s god . ”\nAnd you would be 100 percent correct . Here ’ s Huckabee in South Carolina calling Kim Davis a hero for defying the tyrants of the Supreme Court :\n“ I salute her today , and I stand with her , ” Huckabee said , explaining that he called her up to thank her for standing up to “ judicial tyranny. ” Huckabee added : “ I thank God for Kim Davis , and I hope more Americans will stand with her . ”\nDavis also got an attagirl from her home state senator and increasingly hopeless presidential contender , Rand Paul . Rand wasn ’ t quite so effusive in his praise of Davis as Huckabee , but he did say : “ I think people who do stand up and are making a stand to say that they believe in something is an important part of the American way. ” He is correct that American history is full of people who left their mark by controversially standing up for their beliefs in defiance of the law – people like Orval Faubus , and George Wallace .

    "312": "( CNN ) - There ’ s a deal ! After a whirlwind couple of days of political jockeying , Senate leaders announced the final terms of a bipartisan compromise to reopen the government and raise the debt limit .\nWednesday afternoon . Senators are reading the proposal , and House Republicans and Democrats met separately to review it and consider next steps .\nBoth the Senate and the House are now expected to take it up on Wednesday evening , but it ’ s anyone ’ s guess when they might finish their work .\nPresident Barack Obama praised the Senate compromise and urged quick action in Congress with the government ’ s authority to raise money set to expire on Thursday .\nThe stock market responded positively , jumping by 200 points around noon before settling back a bit as Washington appeared to be pulling back from the fiscal brink . But businesses are blaming the Washington tumult for holding back hiring , according to a new survey .\nIt also would raise the debt limit until February 7 to avert a possible default on U.S. debt obligations for the first time .\nAlso , the White House supports a provision in the deal that strengthens verification measures for people getting subsidies under Obamacare .\nIn addition , the Senate agreement would set up budget negotiations between the House and Senate for a long-term spending plan .\nCruz wo n't block vote in Senate - even though he opposes deal\nBut how would a Senate plan , which was quickly vocally rejected by House Republicans , pass the House ?

Charlie Dent , R-Pennsylvania , said as much on Tuesday night on CNN .\n“ I believe that John Boehner will likely be in a position where he will have to essentially pass the bill that is negotiated between senators McConnell and Reid .

    "313": "Washington ( CNN ) – There appeared to be enough votes in the House on Wednesday to approve legislation to reopen the federal government , according to an ongoing CNN survey of House members .\nAll 200 Democrats and 19 Republicans support passing a continuing resolution with no additional legislative strings attached that would reopen the federal government , which has been partially closed for a week over a bitter policy dispute between Republicans and Democrats on health care . With three vacancies in 435 member House , 217 votes are currently the minimum needed for the measure to win approval in the House .\nCNN 's vote count appears to bear out what President Barack Obama said on Monday .\n`` The truth of the matter is , there are enough Republican and Democratic votes in the House of Representatives right now to end this shutdown immediately with no partisan strings attached , '' Obama said .\nBut this does not mean a vote will happen any time soon , given that these Republicans have not indicated a willingness to try to force Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio , to bring a continuing resolution with no strings attached to the floor for a vote . After a meeting with Republicans on Tuesday , Republican Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma told CNN that the speaker told members there would not be a House vote on a `` clean '' government funding bill .\nThe clean CR is at the center of the dispute between Obama and Republicans , the latter trying to use the government shutdown as a legislative avenue to help defund the president 's health care law . Many House Republicans are demanding that passage of a continuing resolution is contingent on the health care law being delayed – the first step in an effort they hope to use to dismantle it . The president and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nevada , have said that the GOP 's efforts are a non-starter .\nAs is the case with all vote counts , the numbers continually evolve and change by the hour and day .\nStill , Boehner has maintained that there are not enough votes in the House to pass a `` clean '' CR .\n`` There are not the votes in the House to pass a clean CR , '' the speaker said Sunday on ABC 's `` This Week . '' `` The American people expect in Washington , when we have a crisis like this , that the leaders will sit down and have a conversation . I told my members the other day , there may be a back room somewhere , but there 's nobody in it . ''\nRepublican Rep. Charles Dent of Pennsylvania disagreed with the speaker 's assessment . He told CNN on Monday that if the vote were to come to the floor , he believes it would pass .\n`` I believe a clean CR would pass comfortably , '' said Dent . `` I 'm not here to predict the number , I think it would clear the 217 vote barrier . ''\nIn response , Obama dared Boehner on Monday to prove that he does n't have the votes for a clean continuing resolution .\n`` If Republicans and Speaker Boehner are saying there are not enough votes then they should prove it , '' Obama said . `` Let the bill go to the floor , and let 's see what happens . Just vote . ''\nOn Monday , as Democrats trumpeted other vote counts that appeared to show there are enough votes in the House to pass a clean government funding bill , a number of lawmakers began to walk back previous statements .\nRepublican Rep. Devin Nunes of California was one of those lawmakers . After telling Huffington Post and others that he supported a government funding bill with no strings attached , his spokesman said Monday that `` that was never the case . ''\n`` He does not support a clean CR , does not support it , does not advocate it , '' said Jack Langer , a spokesman for Nunes .\nRepublicans Leonard Lance of New Jersey and Randy Forbes of Virginia , who other news outlets report have supported a clean government funding bill , told CNN on Monday that they did not back the measure .\n`` Reports that Randy Forbes supports a 'clean ' CR are not true , '' a Forbes said . `` This was misrepresented in a story by the Virginian Pilot ( newspaper ) , which subsequently was picked up by HuffPo and other national outlets – none of which bothered to contact our office to verify . ''\nInstead , Forbes has introduced legislation that would fund all of the government except Obamcare , the aide said .\nNot all Republicans moved away from voting for a government funding bill with no strings attached .\nLate on Monday , Republican Rep. David Reichert of Washington said he would `` continue to vote for any legislation that keeps the federal government open . ''\nLikewise on Tuesday , Republican Rep. Mike Coffman of Colorado announced he supported a government funding bill with no strings attached in a Denver Post opinion-editorial and Republican Rep. Walter B. Jones of North Carolina said he wished the House `` would pass a clean CR '' during an interview with MSNBC .\nOther Republican members , like Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida , would not confirm a report from the Miami Herald that said the lawmaker would support a clean resolution .\n`` The president needs to sit down and negotiate with the speaker , '' Cesar Gonzalez , a spokesman for Diaz-Balart , said . `` In the meantime , the congressman does not think it is wise to negotiate through the press . ''\nThe 19 Republicans who support a government funding bill with no strings attached are :\nWalter B. Jones , R-North Carolina : Said during an interview with MSNBC that he wished the House `` would pass a clean CR . ''\nMike Coffman , R-Colorado : Announced he supported a government funding bill with no strings attached in a Denver Post opinion-editorial .\nTim Griffin , R-Arkansas : `` Tweeted the he would support a clean government funding bill . ''\nBill Young , R-Florida : A spokesman tells CNN that Young would support a clean government funding bill .\nDennis Ross , R-Florida : A spokeswoman told CNN Ross would support a one-year government funding bill at sequestration levels with no strings attached .\nMike Simpson , R-Idaho : Statement : `` Similar to Sen. Rand Paul , I could support a very short-term clean CR , perhaps one or two weeks , while we continue to negotiate on a longer-term bill . ''\nFrank LoBiondo , R-New Jersey : LoBiondo penned an editorial in the Philadelphia Inquirer that said he supported a clean government funding bill .\nJon Runyan , R- New Jersey : Runyan penned an editorial in the Philadelphia Inquirer that said he supported a clean government funding bill .\nPete King , R-New York : Told CNN he supports passing a clean government funding bill .\nMichael Grimm , R-New York : Grimm told CNN he would support a clean government funding bill .\nJim Gerlach , R-Penn . : A spokesman told CNN that Gerlach would support a clean government funding bill if it came to the floor .\nPat Meehan , R-Penn . : Statement on October 1 : `` I believe it ’ s time for the House to vote for a clean , short-term funding bill . ''\nMichael Fitzpatrick , R-Penn . : Fitzpatrick penned an editorial in the Philadelphia Inquirer that said he supported a clean government funding bill .\nLou Barletta , R-Penn . : A spokesman told CNN that Barletta would vote yes if a clean government funding bill came to the floor . On Tuesday morning , the spokesman said while Barletta is now focused on passing a compromise that includes repealing of the medical device tax , it is fair to include him as a yes vote for a funding bill with no strings attached .\nCharles Dent , R-Penn . : Told CNN he supports a clean government funding bill . `` I think now it 's imperative that we just fund the government , '' he said .\nRobert Wittman , R-Virgina : A spokeswoman tell CNN Wittman would vote yes on a clean government funding bill .\nScott Rigell , R-Virginia : Told CNN on October 1 that he supported passing a clean government funding bill .\nFrank Wolf , R-Virginia : A spokesman tells CNN that Wolf will support a clean government funding bill .\nDavid Reichert , R-Washington : October 7 statement : `` I will continue to vote for any legislation that keeps the federal government open .

    "314": "How did Donald Trump do in his first 100 days as US president ? The moment you step out into the beating heart of America , you realize that ’ s the wrong question .\nHow did the Donald Trumps – plural – do in their first 100 days ? That ’ s the better line of inquiry . And no , it ’ s not a reference to Donald Jr , busily engorging the family business while his father makes America great again .\nThe question to ask is : how did the two Donald Trumps do ? One man , two entirely contrary public figures . There ’ s Donald Trump , champion of the white conservative religious masses of rural and small-town America , the man bringing change to Washington , reviving the nation ’ s pride , teaching a lesson to foreigners with a well-targeted bombing raid or two .\nAnd then there ’ s Donald Trump as seen through the eyes of urban America , minority communities and progressive voters . This president is utterly incompetent , criminally corrupt , or both , is only interested in himself and his rich buddies , and has turned the White House into a reality TV show .\nIt ’ s not hard to track down people who subscribe to one of these Donald Trumps . There are millions of them , scattered unevenly across the United States .\nIn some places , the polar impressions co-exist side by side in their own hermetically sealed bubbles . Like in Ohio , where two neighboring communities straddling a county line have been following the progress of quite different Donald Trumps since the inauguration on 20 January . .\nTo the west of the county border is Warrensville Heights , a city of 14,000 people that is 94 % African American . It lies on the outskirts of Cleveland in Cuyahoga County , one of the key strongholds in this crucial swing state for Hillary Clinton , with 66 % of the county voting for her on election day .\nTo the east of the boundary is Chardon , in Geauga County , where a commanding 61 % voted for Trump . Chardon ’ s 5,000 residents are as white as Warrensville Heights ’ are black , even more so in fact , with the 2010 census recording a 98 % white population . “ We ’ re Anglo-Saxon , God-fearing Republicans , ” as one resident put it .\nTwenty miles and that county line between them . But when it comes to the 45th president , it ’ s as though these two communities are seeing him through alternate realities .\nWe invited residents of Warrensville Heights , who voted Democratic in the presidential election , to tell us the word that came into their minds when they heard the phrase : “ Donald Trump ’ s first 100 days ” .\nThen we put it to Trump voters in Chardon . They said :\nSo what did they mean ? Why , for instance , did Kim Williams , 47 , an African American woman who works at a loans and lottery company , Cash2Go , in Warrensville Heights , say “ stress ” when Trump ’ s 100 days was evoked ?\nBold ? Look at what he ’ s done . I think he ’ s doing what ’ s best for America Ward Lawrence , salesman\n“ I say ‘ stress ’ down to how he ’ s handling things for the people , ” she said . “ Truthfully , I think he ’ s a puppet for rich folk . ”\nShe checked off Trump ’ s travel ban for visitors from Muslim-majority countries , his deportations of non-criminal Latino immigrants , and his failed attempt to scrap the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) as evidence of his discrimination against minorities and in favour of the wealthy . Then she used a vivid metaphor to describe how she believes the president has been duping the American people .\n“ He offers us with real nice food – steak and fries – but when he comes to give it to you it ’ s presented on a trashcan lid . ”\nBy similar measure , why did Ward Lawrence , 81 , a white salesman in Chardon , come up with “ bold ” when given the Trump test ? A clue perhaps was that he ’ d just spent three hours listening to Rush Limbaugh ’ s rightwing talk radio show .\n“ Bold ? Look at what he ’ s done . I think he ’ s doing what ’ s best for America … the Keystone pipeline , he threw out Environmental Protection Agency regulations , he told companies not to move jobs out of the country . ”\nNo worries about climate change ? “ That ’ s a fabrication , ” he said . “ Entirely made up by people who benefit financially from it , starting with Al Gore . ”\nLawrence has no doubt that 97 % of Chardon – his figure – would vote for Trump again . “ Oh yes , absolutely. ” And he , too , has a ripe metaphor for why that should be so . “ We suffered for eight years kissing Obama ’ s ass because he was black . Now Trump says it like it is . ”\nTrump expended much of his energy on the campaign trail last year , and a good deal of it since he entered the White House , talking about his devotion to the “ forgotten ” people . That was barely concealed code for white working-class and middle-class Americans .\nThe strange thing about Ohio is that the equation is reversed . If anyone has been forgotten in these neighboring communities , it is the poor black inhabitants of Warrenville Heights .\nThe area around Jack Racino , a horse racing and gambling casino in the center of the city , has a desolation epitomised by the local super mall that has closed and is being razed to rubble . Letters from its welcome sign , Randall Park , lie in great plastic shards in puddles of oily water where a couple of geese paddle forlornly .\nLife is tough enough for the residents of the “ friendly city ” , as Warrensville Heights styles itself . Median income for a household is $ 33,000 , compared with $ 54,000 in white Chardon . Infant mortality rates in Cuyahoga County are 11 deaths per 1,000 live births , twice the national average .\nDespite such hardship , Trump is proposing to make life worse for the folk of Warrensville Heights . It ’ s not just his ongoing efforts to scrap the ACA , also known as Obamacare , which would disproportionately impact poor families .\nHe is also attempting in next year ’ s budget to cut back on meals for wheels services for elderly people , and free transport for them to hospitals . That ’ s why Gregory Gaines , 49 , a building worker whose mother-in-law is dependent on such assistance , thought of the word “ horrible ” to sum up Trump ’ s 100 days .\n“ Trump ’ s ethics aren ’ t right , ” he said . “ His thinking seems to be to take from those who have not , to give to those who have . ”\nBut the president says he is on the side of the forgotten people . “ Forgotten people ? ” Gaines guffawed . “ We are the forgotten people . I ’ ve yet to see him do anything for the black community . ”\nKay , 58 , who runs a school for hair and nail beauty stylists , chose the word “ clown ” . She said : “ I believe Trump ’ s so used to being on TV that ’ s how he ’ s running the country like a reality show . He says things he knows aren ’ t true , like the crowd size at his inauguration , but wears a mask that makes him look as though it ’ s true . ”\nKay said she thought the assault on funding for the women ’ s health network Planned Parenthood was especially reprehensible . She was derisive also about the senior White House team , namely adviser Kellyanne Conway and press secretary Sean Spicer – “ they talk about fake news , but I heard more fake news from them than anybody ” – and daughter Ivanka – “ could I get a job description , maybe ? ”\nAcross the road , Darius Smith , 29 , responded to the Trump test with the word “ money ” . He gave a simple reason : “ I think Donald Trump bought his way into the White House . ”\nSmith is a gold buyer , which sounds more glamorous than it is . Local residents bring their broken jewelry to him to pawn or sell . A glass showcase in the store is entirely bare , while Smith works at a counter behind iron security bars .\nLike most others in Warrensville Heights , he voted twice for Obama before backing Clinton in November . So how does he think Donald Trump has done in his first 100 days ? “ He hasn ’ t done anything yet . The travel ban didn ’ t go through , and that was a horrible idea . ”\nAfter a half-hour ’ s drive to Chardon , the outlook switches dramatically . There ’ s nothing forgotten about the town ’ s quaint square , with its pretty redbrick courthouse dating from 1869 , or the well-appointed shops serving the surrounding area ’ s prosperous farming community .\nStalls are going up for the 88th annual maple festival this weekend , with bumper cars , a haunted house and “ old-fashioned ” lemonade and hot dog stands . It takes little imagination to get the size of a place that proclaims on its official placard : “ Chardon ’ s square and proud of it ” .\nHere in all-white Chardon , Donald Trump has metamorphosed into action man .\n“ Action ” was the word conjured up by Tim Overberger , 47 , a carpet installer shopping in the square . Wasn ’ t that quite a glowing review to give a president whose key policy efforts have come unstuck at the hands of the courts or his fellow Republicans in Congress ?\n“ I think he ’ s done stuff , ” Overberger protested , though he was hard-pressed to provide details . “ He ’ s signed some bills , though I don ’ t pay attention to that small stuff . He said he was going to bomb , and he did . ”\nHis thinking seems to be to take from those who have not , to give to those who have Gregory Gaines , building worker\nEd , 71 , a car mechanic , used the word “ fast ” to describe what he thought had been a highly productive start to Trump ’ s term in office . “ I like the fact that he ’ s sticking it to these other countries , like North Korea . At least he ’ s doing something . ”\nJeanne Lose , 56 , is that rare animal in Chardon , a resident who is not a dyed-in-the-wool Republican . An independent , she voted for Trump in November , but that was the first time she had backed a conservative presidential candidate in her life . The decision was motivated in part by having been repulsed by Hillary Clinton ’ s surrogates . “ Beyoncé , ” she said . “ I really don ’ t like Beyoncé . ”\nLose chose as her word “ illegals ” to signal her approval for Trump ’ s tough stance on deporting undocumented immigrants . “ I ’ ve got a son lives in Denver , he ’ s a plumber , and there are a lot of illegals out there taking work away from him . ”\nShe liked the travel ban too , buying Trump ’ s line that it would protect the nation from terrorism . “ I just feel so bad for France , they are , like , getting beat up , ” she said .\nAnd so it went . The two Donald Trumps stayed doggedly in their respective bubbles , with virtually no common ground between them . Was there no hope of any communion after these first 100 days , no coming together of any description ?\nIn Chardon , the only Trump voter to give an inch was Caroline Mansfield , 53 , chief deputy at the Geauga county treasurer ’ s office . “ Filter ” was the word that came into her mind , because she said the president could sometimes do with using one to moderate his public comments .\nShe also conceded that Trump had found it very hard in his rookie days to achieve his objectives . But she quickly qualified the point : it was not his fault .\n“ He ’ s doing a great job . But there ’ s been so much opposition to him that it ’ s very difficult for him to get anything done . It ’ s time for us to unite and let him be the president . ”\nWhat does the business world make of Trump 100 days in ? The jury is still out Read more\nThe only person truly prepared to cross the metaphorical county line between Trump and anti-Trump sentiments aptly chose the word “ surprising ” . Kendell Long , 27 , walking home in Warrensville Heights with his three-year-old son , Kendell Jr , said he was finding the new president hard to pin down .\nAt first , everything Trump said or did horrified him . He hated the damage the president ’ s cuts would do to public services , such as Cleveland ’ s world-class hospitals , and he loathed his intemperate outbursts on Twitter or TV . “ There seemed like there was no control to what came out of his mouth . ”\nBut over time Long , who studies psychology at night while holding down a day job at a Valvoline instant oil change franchise , was forced to reappraise , he said . “ I think Trump ’ s starting to think through what he says and does , way more than when he was running . ”\nDidn ’ t he worry about how his peers would respond if he stood up , even just a little , for the president ? “ I don ’ t care about what someone else feels , I only care about what ’ s good for me and my son , ” he said , holding Kendell Jr in his arms . “ As long as Trump ’ s not bringing trouble down on us , like wars and stuff , he ’ s not always such a bad thing . ” \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

    "317": "Washington ( CNN ) - Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Kentucky , on Friday defended his decision back home in Kentucky to join Democrats in a vote to clear a filibuster hurdle that allowed a vote to raise the debt ceiling .\n`` My job is to protect the country when I can and to step up and lead on those occasions when it 's required . That 's what I did , '' he said at a campaign appearance in Louisville .\nMcConnell was one of 12 Republican senators to join Democrats on Tuesday in voting to end debate on the debt-ceiling bill that will extend the federal debt limit for a year , a move his opponents have been quick to criticize him for .\nPresident Obama signed the bill into law Saturday in California , the White House said in a statement .\nMatt Bevin , a tea party conservative who is challenging McConnell in the Kentucky GOP primary in May , said in a statement after the vote Tuesday , `` Kentucky and America can literally no longer afford such financially reckless behavior from the likes of Mitch McConnell . ''\nSen. Ted Cruz , R-Texas , who threatened to filibuster the vote , criticized Senate Republicans for joining with Democrats to vote for the bill saying , `` Every Senate Republican should have stood together . ''\nCommenting on McConnell 's vote , Cruz said that it `` is ultimately a decision for the voters in Kentucky . ''\nBoth Bevin and Cruz also said that McConnell and other Senate Republicans helped give Obama a `` blank check . ''\nAppearing on Mark Levin 's radio program Thursday night , Cruz said , `` If 41 Republicans had stood together and just voted no , the clean debt ceiling , the blank check for President Obama and Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi , would have been denied . ''\nOn Friday Bevin tweeted , `` @ Team_Mitch gave Obama blank check to 'take one for the team ' Which team is he talkin about ? ''\nWhen asked about his opponents ’ comments , McConnell defended his position at the event Friday saying , `` My preference is for a debt ceiling to carry additional legislation that does something about the debt . ''\n`` I 've obviously demonstrated that , '' McConnell said . `` I negotiated the Budget Control Act with Vice President Biden in August of 2011 . It led to a deficit-reduction package that actually reduced government spending for two years in a row for the first time since right after the Korean War . ''\nMcConnell said the House 's inability to come together on a different version of the bill gave him no choice but to vote in favor of passing a clean debt-ceiling bill .\n`` My first choice would be to pass a debt ceiling that had something related to doing something about the debt on it , but as you know , the House of Representatives could n't pass anything else other than a clean debt ceiling . They could n't pass anything else . ''\n`` The Speaker tried a whole lot of different versions , add-ons to the debt ceiling . He could n't get to 218 no matter what combination . So we were confronted with a clean debt ceiling in the Senate or default . ''\nHouse Speaker John Boehner , after unsuccessfully trying to gather enough Republicans to vote on a new version of the bill joked on February 6th , `` You know , Mother Teresa is a saint now , but if the Congress wanted to make her a saint and attach that to the debt ceiling , you probably could n't get 218 Republican votes . ''\nMcConnell also defended his record as a legislator who averts crises , saying : `` I believe I have to act in the best interest of the country , and every time we 've been confronted with a potential crisis , the guy you 're looking at is the one who stepped up and solved the problem , ” he said . “ Whether it was the fiscal cliff deal at the end of 2012 , when everyone 's taxes were going up . Whether it was last October in the 16th day of the government shutdown or yesterday , or Thursday , when it was clear that we needed to produce enough procedural votes to get to a debt ceiling vote in order to avoid a default .

    "318": "President lays wreath at memorial and embraces a survivor of the US atomic bombing that killed 140,000 people\nBarack Obama called on the world to choose a future where Hiroshima was considered “ the start of our own moral awakening ” , as he became the first sitting US president to visit the Japanese city , 71 years after its bombing ushered in the nuclear age he vowed to bring to an end .\nG7 summit : Obama makes historic visit to Hiroshima – live Read more\nIn a scene many survivors of the US bombing believed they would never live to see , Obama laid a floral wreath at a memorial to the dead of the world ’ s first atomic bombing , pausing in a moment of contemplation , his head slightly bowed .\nHe then paid tribute to the people of Hiroshima , calling on humanity to learn the lessons of the past to make war less likely .\n“ On a bright , cloudless morning , death fell from the sky and the world was changed , ” he said , adding that humankind had shown that day it had the means to destroy itself .\n“ Why did we come to this place , to Hiroshima ? We come to ponder a terrible force unleashed in the not so distant past . We come to mourn the dead , ” he said .\n“ Their souls speak to us , they ask us to look inward , take stock of who we are . ”\nIn a touching moment , Obama embraced Shigeaki Mori , a 79-year-old survivor who appeared overcome with emotion .\n“ The president gestured as if he was going to give me a hug , so we hugged , ” said Mori , who spent decades tracing the families of 12 American POWs who died in the attack and ensured their deaths were officially recognised .\nObama also chatted to Sunao Tsuboi , the 91-year-old head of a survivors group , who thanked the president for his visit , but reminded him of his responsibility to act on his desire , first made in Prague in 2009 , to bring about a world without nuclear weapons .\nObama urged the world to “ choose a future when Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not considered the dawn of atomic warfare but as the start of our own moral awakening . ”\nHe said : “ Technological progress without equivalent progress in human institutions can doom us . The scientific revolution that led to the splitting of the atom requires a moral revolution as well .\n“ This is why we come to this place , we stand here , in the middle of this city and force ourselves to imagine the moment the bomb fell .\n“ We force ourselves to feel the dread of children confused by what they see . We listen to a silent cry .\nHiroshima and the nuclear age – a visual guide Read more\n“ Some day , the voices will no longer be with us to bear witness , but the memory must never fade . That memory fuels our imagination . It allows us to change . ”\nHis address included mention of the tens of thousands of Koreans – many of them forced labourers – who died in the attack , as well as the American dead .\nIn the distance stood the burned-out shell of the Atomic Bomb Dome – a peace memorial that is the most potent physical symbol of Hiroshima ’ s tragic past and its recovery from the ashes of war .\nAs expected , Obama did not offer an apology for the decision by his predecessor , Harry Truman , to unleash an atomic bomb over the city . The attack at the end of the second world war on 6 August 1945 killed an estimated 80,000 people soon after the blast . By the end of the year , the death toll had reached 140,000 .\nObama and Tsuboi laughed at one point , the president smiling broadly . But mostly he listened , holding the elderly man ’ s hand in his own , an interpreter standing nearby . Tsuboi stamped his cane emphatically while speaking .\nObama was accompanied by the Japanese prime minister , Shinzō Abe , whose presence , Obama said ahead of the visit , would “ highlight the extraordinary alliance ” the US had created during the seven decades since the end of the war .\nAfter looking at some of the exhibits in the peace museum , Obama wrote in the visitors ’ book : “ We have known the agony of war . Let us now find the courage , together , to spread peace , and pursue a world without nuclear weapons ” – a goal he conceded he may not see in his lifetime .\nAbe described Obama ’ s visit as “ courageous ” , saying : “ An American president has come into contact with the reality of an atomic bombing and renewed his resolve toward realising a world without nuclear weapons .\n“ I sincerely welcome this historic visit , which has long been awaited by not only the people of Hiroshima , but by all Japanese people . ”\nKaneko Izumi , a Hiroshima resident who was among the hundreds of people who filled the peace park in the evening to pay their respects to the victims , said Obama ’ s speech had offered hope to ageing survivors “ who have been waiting most of their lives for an American president to come here ” .\nNot all residents were satisfied with the president ’ s speech , however . “ I ’ m afraid I did not hear anything concrete about how he plans to achieve the abolition of nuclear weapons , ” said Miki Tsukishita , who was five years old when the bomb was dropped . “ Just cheering his visit is not enough . He is a serving US president ... I wish he had been more specific . ”\nObama had long held the desire to go to Hiroshima , despite the potential for the visit to cause controversy in the US .\nWhile many Japanese consider the attack a war crime – yet recognise the part their country ’ s militarist leaders played in bringing it about – the consensus in the US is that the attack hastened the end of the Pacific war , saving many more American and Japanese lives .\nJapan surrendered on 15 August , less than a week after the US dropped a second atomic bomb , on the western port city of Nagasaki , killing more than 70,000 people . Obama said during a visit to Japan in late 2009 that he would be honoured to go to Hiroshima and Nagasaki .\n“ I certainly would be honoured – it would be meaningful for me to visit those two cities in the future , ” he said .\nBefore Friday , the only western leader to have visited Hiroshima while in office was Kevin Rudd , who laid a wreath at the peace park cenotaph in 2008 when he was Australian prime minister .\nJimmy Carter visited the atomic bomb memorial in Hiroshima in 1984 , after he had left office , but no sitting US president has ever visited the city . The highest-ranking US official to visit the site was Nancy Pelosi in 2008 when she was House speaker . The ambassador , Caroline Kennedy , attended the 70th anniversary commemorations last year .\nThe White House reportedly decided to proceed with the visit after the largely positive reaction to John Kerry ’ s tribute to the victims of the Hiroshima bombing on the sidelines of the G7 foreign ministers ’ meeting last month .\nAhead of Friday ’ s visit , Obama told US Marines and members of the Japanese military at the Iwakuni base in western Japan how it was “ a testament to how even the most painful divides can be bridged . How two nations can become not just partners but the best of friends ” .\nHis trip , he said , was an “ opportunity to honour the memory of all who were lost in world war two ” but also had a message for today .\n“ I do think that part of the reason I ’ m going is because I want to once again underscore the very real risks that are out there and the sense of urgency that we all should have , ” Obama said .\n“ So it ’ s not only a reminder of the terrible toll of world war two and the death of innocents across continents , but it ’ s also to remind ourselves that the job is not done in reducing conflict , building institutions of peace , and reducing the prospect of nuclear war in the future . ”\nStory of cities # 24 : how Hiroshima rose from the ashes of nuclear destruction Read more\nWhile polls showed most Japanese welcomed Obama ’ s gesture , other countries in the region warned against allowing the visit to reinforce a one-dimensional view of Japan ’ s role in the second world war .\nThe Chinese foreign ministry said Japan should not forget the “ grave suffering ” it inflicted on its neighbours during the war .\n“ We hope Japan can take a responsible attitude toward its own people and the international community , and earnestly take history as a mirror to avoid a recurrence of the tragedy of the war , ” ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters .\nThe state-run China Daily went much further , claiming the “ atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were of Japan ’ s own making ” .\nIn an editorial on the eve of the visit , the paper accused Japan of “ trying to portray Japan as the victim of world war two rather than one of its major perpetrators ” .\nThe bombing of both Hiroshima and Nagasaki was justified , the China Daily said , as “ a bid to bring an early end to the war and prevent protracted warfare from claiming even more lives ” .\nIt added : “ It was the war of aggression the Japanese militarist government launched against its neighbours and its refusal to accept its failure that had led to US dropping the atomic bombs . ” \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "319": "In a very famous ( and possibly apocryphal ) quote , Lyndon Johnson said upon signing the 1964 Civil Rights Act that the Democrats had lost the South for a generation . And there 's little doubt that the Republicans immediately saw a path to a new majority . That realignment took more than a generation to gradually happen , but happen it did . The GOP marched through one election after another burning down every Southern Democratic stronghold in its wake .\nAnd the Democrats have been bemoaning their Lost Cause ever since . For decades it was an article of faith that the only way for the Democrats to achieve a real majority again would be to recapture that Southern white vote . They agreed that they had to only nominate sons of the South who could speak the lingo . And they had to ensure that they never again spoke ill of guns , only spoke ill of gays and always praised God as if every day was an evangelical revival meeting . This was best articulated by a strategist by the name of Mudcat Saunders who spelled it out as clearly as anyone 's ever done it :\nSouthNow : What ’ s the prescription for Democrats ? Mudcat : There ’ s only one prescription and that ’ s tolerance . I ’ m a white , southern male who hunts . I ’ m a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans , which has two black members , by the way . I don ’ t know how many northern Democrats who have tolerance for my kind . SouthNow : What ’ s your strategy for Southern progress ? Mudcat : We need to quit all this tap dancin ’ around the truth .... We need to stop tap dancin ’ around the issues of guns , gays and God .... We ’ ve lost the white male . We need to get ‘ em back . We need to get through the cultural wall . It ’ s a wall of straw . Inside every rural Republican is a Democrat trying to get out . Saunders , who has worked on the campaigns of Mark Warner , John Edwards , and Bob Graham , thinks that if Democrats ease up on the culture stuff they can win in the South : `` We ’ ve got an affection for big guns and fast cars . It ’ s a macho thing . I ’ ve not seen any attempt by the Democrats to get into that culture . ''\nHe was wrong about that . They tried , oh how they tried . It just did n't work . And why was that ? Well , the Democrats have a constituency that these rural , white Southern males are n't too fond of . Several as a matter of fact .\n`` Bubba doesn ’ t call them illegal immigrants . He calls them illegal aliens . If the Democrats put illegal aliens in their bait can , we ’ re going to come home with a bunch of white males in the boat . ''\nMudcat may be a little cruder than most but he was far from alone in thinking this way . The problem was that Democrats just could n't thread that needle . The party of people of color , feminists , urban dwellers and gays was not going to be particularly appealing to Mudcat 's Bubbas regardless of how often Democrats like Howard Dean excitedly exhorted them to vote for their own self-interest :\n`` White folks in the South who drive pickup trucks with Confederate flag decals in the back ought to be voting with us and not them , because their kids do n't have health insurance , either , and their kids need better schools , too . ''\nYou 'd think so , would n't you ? Entire books have been written about this strange phenomenon in American political life that explains in great detail why they do n't . Let 's just say they would rather die than vote for a Democrat . Literally .\nIf you want to see that vividly illustrated , look at this from the Democracy Corps ' latest polling .\nIt turns out that you can no longer assume that `` rural '' and `` Southern '' align , at least not when it comes to healthcare . Across the country , people are starting to warm up to the healthcare reforms and want to see it successfully implemented . But Southern , rural white voters are still opposed . And they are n't budging . These are unattainable voters for the Democratic Party and have been for a very long time .\nUnfortunately , as Joshua Green points out , this is still somewhat relevant in the upcoming congressional elections where some Democrats have managed to hang on to their seats by their fingernails long after most of the old Southern Democratic Lions shuffled off their mortal coils , while others slipped in on a fluke . He points to Rep. Patrick Murphy , Fla.-18 , Rep. Joe Garcia , Fla.-26 ) , Rep.John Barrow , Ga.-12 , Rep. Pete Gallego , Texas-23 , and Rep. Nick Rahall , W.Va.-03 ) as being in particular trouble .\nLet 's just say that if those fine fellows fail to win another term , progressives are not going to mourn their loss . They are among the most conservative Democrats in the House , routinely crossing the aisle to give aid and comfort to the Republicans . They 've been putting `` illegals '' in the bait can , among other such Bubba-enticements , for a long time and it looks like it wo n't be enough to save them . And perhaps that 's for the best . The Democrats can finally put their dreams of re-creating the Roosevelt coalition behind them once and for all . That coalition required that the Democratic Party ignore any commitment to ending Jim Crow and there 's no going back to that kind of politics . There are seats outside the rural deep South they could contest .\nAnd if those conservative , white Southern male voters ever wake up to the fact that their enemies are n't feminazis , African-Americans or Latinos and figure out just who it is who 's really keeping them down , I 'm quite sure the Democrats would be proud to have them back in the fold . Until then Bubba 's going to be the heart and soul of the GOP . He 's their problem now . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

    "321": "Senator who the president derides with a racist nickname has a book to promote , a seat to win and rumors of a White House bid to … neither confirm nor deny\nDonald Trump has named his most likely challenger in the 2020 presidential election . It is Elizabeth Warren .\n100 daze of Trump : euphoria and nausea on the White House rollercoaster Read more\nStanding before the faithful of the National Rifle Association in Atlanta on Friday , the president predicted a surfeit of candidates . “ You ’ ll have plenty of those Democrats coming over and you ’ re going to say , ‘ No , sir , no thank you – no , ma ’ am , ’ ” the president said . “ Perhaps ma ’ am . It may be Pocahontas , remember that . ”\nPocahontas is the racially charged term that Trump used on the campaign trail to dismiss Warren , who has claimed Native American heritage . Clearly , she had got under his skin . The Massachusetts senator was a self-declared “ nasty woman ” with a message for Trump : “ Women have had it with guys like you. ” She went toe to toe with him on his favourite medium , Twitter , hammering him for delivering a “ one-two punch of bigotry and economic lies ” .\nIt is small wonder that , if asked who now personifies the anti-Trump resistance , Warren would come top of many people ’ s lists . At 67 , the former Harvard law professor is a formidable figure with a reputation for reticence bordering on aloofness when approached by reporters in the corridors of Capitol Hill . But the woman who walks into Senate Democratic offices in Washington for this interview , wearing a blue jacket and dark trousers , is the opposite of aloof .\n“ Elizabeth Warren , ” she says , despite being instantly recognisable to anyone following US politics , offering a handshake and warm smile .\nShe reminisces about her first visit to this room , when she was on her way to becoming a senator in 2012 , and jokes about ███ ’ s voice recorder resembling a Taser . But when she turns to business , she is characteristically forthright and makes clear that Barack Obama ’ s grace period – a presidential afterglow in which he is beyond criticism in the Democratic party – is over .\nMost Americans are being left behind in this economy . Worse than being left behind , they ’ re getting kicked in the teeth\n“ I think President Obama , like many others in both parties , talks about a set of big national statistics that look shiny and great but increasingly have giant blind spots , ” she says . “ That GDP , unemployment , no longer reflect the lived experiences of most Americans . And the lived experiences of most Americans is that they are being left behind in this economy .\n“ Worse than being left behind , they ’ re getting kicked in the teeth . ”\nIn the topsy-turvy election , both Trump and the leftwing candidate for the Democratic nomination , Bernie Sanders , spoke of a rigged economy . Hillary Clinton , the Democratic nominee , has articulated the view that Obama did not get the credit he deserved from rescuing America from the financial crisis of 2007-08 . That , it transpired , was small comfort to voters in decaying industrial towns who felt the globalisation train had left the station without them .\nWith Sanders still a leading voice and energy coming from the progressive base , and centrist politics around the world in retreat , it might be tempting for the Democrats to turn left . Warren – who grew up in deep red Oklahoma but now lives in Massachusetts , the state of the Kennedys – frames the question in a different way . Again , she demonstrates a willingness to criticise her own party .\n“ I think left-right is less and less an accurate description of the political landscape , ” she says . “ Now , having said that , I think there are real differences between the Republicans and the Democrats here in the United States . The Republicans have clearly thrown their lot in with the rich and the powerful , but so have a lot of Democrats . You know , it ’ s a question of walking the walk on working people , on fighting for working people . I think that was the real point . ”\nWarren did not not name any individuals . Some commentators have criticised Bill and Hillary Clinton for becoming too close to wealthy elites .\nMuch has been written in the electoral postmortems over the definition of a Democrat : whether economic populism was neglected during the election in favour of identity politics relating to gender , race and sexuality . For progressives , it might be argued that Warren represents the best of Clinton and Sanders rolled into one : strong on issues such as equal pay and reproductive rights but equally strong on class inequality and economic opportunity . This is also what makes her such a tempting target for Trump and the Republicans .\n“ I think it ’ s a false choice , ” she says . “ To talk about the economics of survival in the 21st century is also to include a woman ’ s right to make decisions over her own body , a woman ’ s meaningful access to birth control . That is as deeply woven into the economic stability of that woman individually , her family , her community , this entire nation . I think those are deeply tied to each other . Not either-ors . ”\nThe senator ’ s choice of abortion as an example is timely . Sanders triggered fierce soul searching in the party last week by rallying in Omaha , Nebraska for a mayoral candidate who opposes abortion rights but promises economic justice . Pro-choice activists described it as a betrayal of the women who have been in the vanguard of the resistance to Trump .\nWould Warren endorse a Democratic candidate who was anti-abortion ? “ Probably not , ” she says . “ But let me be clear . Look , I ’ m pro-choice , I ’ m strongly pro-choice , I ’ ve been in these fights forever and forever and forever and at the federal level this is powerfully important to me … I get that not everyone in the Democratic party agrees with me but I am in this fight all the way . ”\nTrump has energised and galvanised the apathetic and apolitical . He made politics great again in the sense of getting people to care instead of allowing it to hum softly in the background . Suddenly , it is no longer a tepid struggle within the grey managerial class . Suddenly it matters . Newspaper readership and news channel viewership have revived after years of decline ; late-night TV comedians are thriving . What Trump Did Next is a constant topic of conversation at dinner tables . It may yet prove to be his legacy .\nMany call Trump a fascist . 100 days in , is he just a reactionary Republican ? | Victoria de Grazia Read more\nOn 21 January , for example , more than 400,000 protesters took part in a women ’ s march in Washington , with millions more marching across America and around the world . For Warren , it was an awakening : “ I think that when the history of this time period is written it will be about Donald Trump ’ s election , no doubt , but it will be about the Women ’ s March the day after Donald Trump was inaugurated . Democracy changed in America on that day .\n“ We are no longer a country that believes we can do politics only once every four years , or even once every two years , no longer a country that says that democracy is only about elections and that it will tend to itself in the time periods between elections . People are deeply engaged in issues right now . The healthcare fight . Immigration . ”\nWarren advocates marches and rallies , online protests , viral videos , collective action and running for office . “ Let me give a giant hug to the resistance . Resistance , persistence , insistence – every part of it – and how to bring more people into the fight . Look , Democrats are in the minority in the House , in the Senate , our tools are very limited to block Trump ’ s actions but democracy is working in an entirely new way .\n“ This is one of the things I now talk about everywhere we go , about how to get more engaged and how people can make their voices more effective , and how they can make sure they get heard in Washington , and it is changing the United States Congress . Not fast enough , but it ’ s changing it . ”\nTrump has tried to undermine a free press . He ’ s shown no respect for the courts . Those are the steps authoritarians take\nWarren , a mother of two and grandmother of three , is at the tip of that particular spear . She has never met Trump – the closest she came was at the inauguration – but she clashed with him on Twitter last year . “ Thumbs at 30 paces , ” she jokes , miming the typing action in mid-air . On 21 March 2016 , she posted : “ Many of history ’ s worst authoritarians started out as losers – and @ realDonaldTrump is a serious threat. ” In her new book , This Fight is Our Fight , she recalls on inauguration day seeing protesters carrying a giant banner that said just one word : “ FASCIST . ”\nAsked if she considers Trump an authoritarian , a fascist , she replies forcefully : “ Look at what he has done . He has expressed his admiration for Mussolini , for Vladimir Putin . He has tried to undermine a free press . He ’ s shown no respect for the courts . Those are the steps that authoritarians take . ”\nCan America withstand it ? “ That ’ s ultimately what the book is about . It ’ s the narrative arc of how America built a middle class and then corporate CEOs and billionaires took the legs out from underneath the middle class , how their tool was money , and the final chapter , whether or not we can withstand the punch that Donald Trump delivers to our working families and to our democracy . And yet , I would say , this book ends on a note of optimism . ”\nTrump may be a one-off but the conditions that produced him are not . The disillusionment in towns across America that felt forgotten by flashy big cities , that felt they had nothing to lose by voting for Trump , rhymed with what led to the Brexit vote in the UK . America had Reagan and trickle-down economics ; Britain had Thatcher and the invisible hand of the market .\n“ There are certainly parallels , ” Warren says . “ Billionaires and corporate CEOs have figured out that for an investment of millions of dollars – they can get returns of billions of dollars . So if they can get their snout to the trough of government money , government handouts , government gifts , government loopholes , they can get richer and richer and richer .

    "322": "There is no such thing as justice for a dead 18-year-old kid . Justice , to borrow from Mychal Denzel Smith , would mean Mike Brown gets home on that sweltering summer day . Justice would mean a future for Brown , a long stream of years to be spent however he would have spent them .\nThe possibility of justice for Mike Brown died with him back in August .\nWhat we had before us with the grand jury hearing was the prospect of fairness , imperfectly defined in a terribly broken and racist system . And here that would have meant a white police officer standing trial for killing an unarmed black kid . It would have meant that 12 people walked into a room and decided , together , that an 18-year-old did not deserve to die because a cop told him to get on the sidewalk , and that Darren Wilson deserved to face a jury of his peers for putting six bullets into Brown ’ s arms and head .\nJustice is always elusive in this system . What continues to shock , even the cynical , is how the appearance of fairness is often too much to ask . It ’ s more than likely that Wilson would have escaped a conviction had he gone to trial , but an indictment would have been a sign , meager as it was , that the system recognized the value of Mike Brown ’ s life . An acknowledgment that putting Wilson on paid administrative leave or a desk position or an orchestrated resignation was not an appropriate response to an officer killing an unarmed teenager .\nI thought again of fairness and justice and how our system overwhelmingly fails black Americans on both counts when Marissa Alexander agreed to a plea deal that would grant her release from jail come January . Alexander , who was arrested and jailed after firing a warning shot to ward off the man who had a history of abusing her and had threatened to kill her , likely took the deal because the alternative was 60 years in prison . Alexander pleaded guilty to three charges of aggravated assault and was sentenced to three years , including the time she had already served .\nAccepting the plea was likely a choice between death and death . Alexander has already spent 1,030 days in jail . Submitting to the will of the court maybe seemed like a burden worth shouldering if it meant getting outside the system that has only vilified her , brought her suffering and cruelty .\nAlexander wanted justice when she defended herself against her abusive husband . She was arrested for having such an ambition . Once at trial , she expected fairness . The state of Florida denied her that , too .\nAnd so it goes for Mike Brown ’ s family . In a statement after the news from the grand jury came down , Brown 's parents called for continued action to fix the unjust system that let Wilson walk and said only , “ We are profoundly disappointed that the killer of our child will not face the consequence of his actions . ”\nThe killer of their child will not face the consequence of his actions . Even the modest consequence of having to stand before a jury that in all likelihood would have let him walk .\nI ’ m not sure what happens next . Protests have kept the nation ’ s attention on Ferguson for months , and the people organizing there and elsewhere will likely strengthen in the wake of the grand jury ’ s refusal to indict . Their activism has fostered a national and international conversation , one growing from the roots up , about police violence , about the racism of the criminal justice system , about a culture of white supremacy , about who gets to fear for their lives .\nAnd Brown 's parents , Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr. , were right to remind us that , even through their pain , `` We need to work together to fix the system that allowed this to happen . '' Because a Wilson indictment would have been important -- a victory for fairness , of the system working how we 're told that it should . But justice for McSpadden and Brown might just be having their son 's name on the nation 's lips as a movement pushes for a system that can hold officers to account when they kill with impunity .\nAs the body count rises , as the names of the young black kids whose lives have been stolen from them are uttered during marches and across kitchen tables , momentum is building . Change is coming .\nBut it ’ s too slow . Too slow for Mike Brown . Too slow for Tamir Rice . Too slow for Akai Gurley . Too slow for Marissa Alexander . Too slow . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "323": "( CNN ) – A “ conservative Republican ” manager of Cincinnati-based IRS screeners told congressional investigators there was no evidence the White House was involved in the agency ’ s targeting of conservative groups , according to the Democratic leader of a committee probing the scandal .\nThis refutes claims by some Republicans that the groups were targeted at the direction of political operatives working to get President Barack Obama re-elected , said Rep. Elijah Cummings , D-Maryland , on CNN 's `` State of the Union '' on Sunday .\n“ He is a conservative Republican working for the IRS . I think this interview and these statements go a long way to showing that the White House was not involved in this , ” he said .\nFurther , Cummings said the interviews conducted by the House Oversight Committee were conclusive enough for the investigation to be considered complete .\n“ Based upon everything I ’ ve seen , the case is solved , ” he said . “ If it were me , I would wrap this case up and move on . ”\nRep. Darrell Issa , the Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee , told CNN ’ s “ State of the Union ” last Sunday that interviews with workers in the Cincinnati IRS office indicated the targeting of conservative groups was `` a problem that was coordinated in all likelihood right out of Washington headquarters - and we 're getting to proving it . ''\n“ My gut tells me that too many people knew this wrongdoing was going on before the election , and at least by some sort of convenient , benign neglect , allowed it to go on through the election , ” Issa said . “ I ’ m not making any allegations as to motive , that they set out to do it , but certainly people knew it was happening . ”\nBut in the interview excerpts released by Cummings , the charge of political motivation is refuted by the Cincinnati manager , who described himself to investigators as a “ conservative Republican . ”\n“ I do not believe that the screening of these cases had anything to do other than consistency and identifying issues that needed to have further development , ” the manager said , according to the document released by the Democratic staff of the Oversight Committee .\nThe excerpts indicate the manager was later asked whether he had “ any reason to believe that anyone in the White House was involved in the decision to screen Tea Party cases . ”\nThe manager replied “ I have no reason to believe that . ”\nLike Issa , Cummings released only portions of the investigators ’ interview with the manager , despite CNN ’ s request for the full transcript . On “ State of the Union , ” Cummings said he has repeatedly called for Issa to release the full interview transcripts , and if Issa chooses not to by the end of the week , he would release the full interviews himself .\nIn the excerpts Cummings did release , the manager tells interviewers that it was his decision to send one particular application in 2010 to the Washington tax-exempt office – not for political reasons , but rather so a precedent could be set for later cases where screeners suspected a group of conducting political activity .\n“ In his interview he said over and over again , ‘ I want it to be consistent. ’ So that 's how all of this got started . Period , ” Cummings said .\nResponding later Sunday , Issa said Cummings ' assertion the investigation was solved was `` extreme and reckless . ''\n`` The testimony excerpts Ranking Member Cummings revealed today did not provide anything enlightening or contradict other witness accounts , '' Issa said . `` The only thing Ranking Member Cummings left clear in his comments today is that if it were up to him the investigation would be closed .

    "325": "About 50 years ago , the Republican party made a conscious decision to become the party of white men . It was a smart strategic move that ushered in an era of neoliberalism and GOP dominance throughout the final decades of the 20th century , though it has always been an odd alliance between poor and working class white Southerners and wealthy business and financial elites . This alliance , widely known as the `` Southern Strategy , '' has remained generally stable for nearly half a century , but today , the cracks are starting to widen , and it is seemingly falling apart . As William Greider pointed out in The Nation earlier this week :\n“ The party establishment , including business and financial leaders , seems to realize that Republicans need to moderate their outdated posture on social issues . But they can ’ t persuade their own base—especially Republicans in the white South—to change . The longer the GOP holds out , the more likely it is to be damaged by the nation ’ s changing demographics—the swelling impact of Latinos and other immigrants , and the flowering influence of millennials , the 18-to-30-year-olds who are more liberal and tolerant than their elders . ”\nWhile the country at large is moving past the social intolerance that has long plagued our political discourse , a significant part of the GOP has refused to budge when it comes to issues like gay marriage , immigration , and reproductive rights . Leading candidates in the GOP primary -- like Donald Trump , Ben Carson , and Carly Fiorina , who are all doing their best to rile up social conservatives -- reveal this stubbornness .\nHowever , America ’ s changing demographics -- or as Ann Coulter calls it , the “ browning of America ” -- is the most damning change for the Republican party . The fact that America is becoming more and more diverse , while the GOP is seemingly doubling down on its white identity politics , does not bode well for its future .\nThe Southern Strategy came about during the Civil Rights era , particularly after the President Lyndon Johnson , a Democrat from Texas , signed into law the Civil Rights Act of 1964 . “ I think we just delivered the South to the Republican party for a long time to come , ” Johnson presciently said to a White House aide .\nRichard Nixon was the first Republican candidate to run on the Southern Strategy , with the backing of the nation 's foremost “ Dixiecrat , ” Strom Thurmond , who had sustained the longest filibuster in history in order to delay a vote on the 1957 Civil Rights Act . In 1972 , Nixon swept the historically Democratic South , and , except for a hiccup in the form of Georgia native Jimmy Carter , the region has been a Republican stronghold ever since .\nBut it was Ronald Reagan who was the first truly neoliberal president to ran on the Southern Strategy , using dog-whistle terms like `` welfare queen '' and promoting states rights ’ issues in the deep South , where civil rights demonstrators had been terrorized a decade earlier . The late Republican strategist , Lee Atwater , notoriously described the southern strategy in an off-the-record interview :\n“ You start out in 1954 by saying , ‘ N * * * er , n * * * er , n * * * er. ’ By 1968 you can ’ t say ‘ n * * * er ’ —that hurts you , backfires . So you say stuff like , uh , forced busing , states ’ rights , and all that stuff , and you ’ re getting so abstract . Now , you ’ re talking about cutting taxes , and all these things you ’ re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is , blacks get hurt worse than whites . ”\nNo wonder the Republican party is so hostile towards immigrants with darker skin . According to a Pew Research Center poll , the most Republican segments of the population are white evangelicals , white southerners , white men with some college or less , and Mormons ( a church that had banned black people up until 1978 ) .\nHowever , internal dissension , which has become quite clear with the lingering search for the next House Speaker , is casting in sharp relief a party that is self-destructing before our very eyes . A minority of extremists are holding the GOP hostage , and even Ayn Rand ’ s greatest admirer , Paul Ryan , is now considered too left-wing by certain congressional conservatives . The establishment Republicans , i.e . big business conservatives and neocons , can no longer control the social conservatives , or the right-wing populists -- particularly those from the South -- and the contradictory alliance that helped the GOP dominate for so many years is dissolving . The chief defender of the Republican establishment , David Brooks , has called the Republican party “ ungovernable , ” while 2008 Republican presidential candidate John McCain has said : “ People do expect us to govern . I think it ’ s a degree of unrest and dissatisfaction amongst our base that we have not seen before . ”\nFor many decades , the business and financial elite of the GOP were able to keep their Southern cohorts in line , but today , a kind of right-wing populism has taken over much of the party . This style of populism has historically been anti-immigrant , anti-elitist , nationalist , and prone to white-supremacist views . It is not a surprise that it has become fashionable again ; we are living in a time of social progress , and America is rapidly becoming more diverse . The enormous increase in inequality and the corruption of Washington have also contributed to the distrust of government and the rise of an authoritarian demagogue like Donald Trump .\nIt is reactionary populism at its core , and it has been waiting to erupt . It is the final battle cry of white males and their declining dominance in American life . Needless to say , at a time when diversity is at an all time high , and the population at large has become more socially progressive ( especially young people ) , this movement does not have the strength to gain any kind of majority , but it could very well be enough to send the Republican party to its grave . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

''\n`` And when that comes forward , we need to know who wrote the policy and who approved the policy , '' the Republican senator from Kentucky said on CNN 's `` State of the Union . ''\nPressed for more precise details about the memo he was referring to , Paul said he has n't seen such a policy statement but has heard about it .\n`` Well , we keep hearing the reports and we have several specifically worded items saying who was being targeted . In fact , one of the bullet points says those who are critical of the president . So I do n't know if that comes from a policy , but that 's what 's being reported in the press and reported orally , '' he told CNN 's chief political correspondent Candy Crowley . `` I have n't seen a policy statement , but I think we need to see that . ''\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell also said the IRS targeting was an example of the administration punishing its opponents .\n`` There is a culture of intimidation throughout the administration , '' he said Sunday on NBC 's `` Meet the Press . ''\nWhile he admitted that all the facts were not yet known , he argued an attitude of `` government knows best ” seems to permeate .\n`` The nanny state is here to tell us all what to do and if you start criticizing , you get targeted , '' he said .\nAppearing before a congressional committee Friday , IRS officials said a large increase in workload , rather than deliberate targeting , led to `` foolish mistakes '' and the political discrimination cited by the inspector general 's report last week .\nNumerous conservative groups said they faced heavy scrutiny and lengthy questionnaires in the past few years as they attempted to get tax-exempt status . The IRS admitted earlier this month it made mistakes , saying its office in Ohio that processed tax-exempt applications began singling out groups whose names included `` tea party '' and `` patriot '' for further review .\nThe actions have spurred criticism from both parties in Congress and President Barack Obama . A new CNN/ORC International survey released Sunday indicated that 71 % of Americans find the targeting unacceptable .\nTwo IRS officials have announced they 'll leave their posts , and more current and former IRS higher-ups are slated to appear for congressional hearings this week .\nBut Paul argued more people needed to be let go , saying the Obama administration did n't do enough in disciplining officials after the terror attack against a U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi , Libya , in September .\n`` Why does Benghazi go on ? No one was ever fired . So people made tragic errors - no one 's accepting responsibility and no one was fired , '' he said .\nFour State Department officials , however , were disciplined in December , with one resigning and three being placed on administrative leave and relieved of their duties .

He plans to make a trip to New Hampshire , the first-in-the-nation primary state , on Monday .\nAsked if he was politicizing the controversy , Paul said he brings up the topic `` in every state and every stop because I think it 's pretty important for her to accept blame for not providing security .

    "329": "As a first step , I believe it necessary for the members and leadership of the Democratic National Committee to step down and be replaced by people who are determined to create a party that represents America – including all those who feel powerless and disenfranchised , and who have been left out of our politics and left behind in our economy .\nThe Democratic Party as it is now constituted has become a giant fundraising machine , too often reflecting the goals and values of the moneyed interests . This must change . The election of 2016 has repudiated it . We need a people ’ s party – a party capable of organizing and mobilizing Americans in opposition to Donald Trump ’ s Republican party , which is about to take over all three branches of the U.S. government . We need a New Democratic Party that will fight against intolerance and widening inequality .\nWhat happened in America Tuesday should not be seen as a victory for hatefulness over decency . It is more accurately understood as a repudiation of the American power structure .\nAt the core of that structure are the political leaders of both parties , their political operatives , and fundraisers ; the major media , centered in New York and Washington DC ; the country ’ s biggest corporations , their top executives , and Washington lobbyists and trade associations ; the biggest Wall Street banks , their top officers , traders , hedge-fund and private-equity managers , and their lackeys in Washington ; and the wealthy individuals who invest directly in politics .\nAt the start of the 2016 election cycle , this power structure proclaimed Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush shoo-ins for the nominations of the Democratic and Republican parties . After all , both of these individuals had deep bases of funders , well-established networks of political insiders , experienced political advisers and all the political name recognition any candidate could possibly want .\nBut a funny thing happened on the way to the White House . The presidency was won by Donald Trump , who made his fortune marketing office towers and casinos , and , more recently , starring in a popular reality-television program , and who has never held elective office or had anything to do with the Republican party . Hillary Clinton narrowly won the popular vote , but not enough of the states and their electors secure a victory .\nHillary Clinton ’ s defeat is all the more remarkable in that her campaign vastly outspent the Trump campaign on television and radio advertisements , and get-out-the-vote efforts . Moreover , her campaign had the support in the general election not of only the kingpins of the Democratic party but also many leading Republicans , including most of the politically active denizens of Wall Street and the top executives of America ’ s largest corporations , and even former Republican president George HW Bush . Her campaign team was run by seasoned professionals who knew the ropes . She had the visible and forceful backing of Barack Obama , whose popularity has soared in recent months , and his popular wife . And , of course , she had her husband .\nTrump , by contrast , was shunned by the power structure . Mitt Romney , the Republican presidential candidate in 2012 , actively worked against Trump ’ s nomination . Many senior Republicans refused to endorse him , or even give him their support . The Republican National Committee did not raise money for Trump to the extent it had for other Republican candidates for president .\nThere had been hints of the political earthquake to come . Trump had won the Republican primaries , after all . More tellingly , Clinton had been challenged in the Democratic primaries by the unlikeliest of candidates – a 74-year-old Jewish senator from Vermont who described himself as a democratic socialist and who was not even a Democrat . Bernie Sanders went on to win 22 states and 47 percent of the vote in those primaries . Sanders ’ major theme was that the country ’ s political and economic system was rigged in favor of big corporations , Wall Street and the very wealthy .\nThe power structure of America wrote off Sanders as an aberration , and , until recently , didn ’ t take Trump seriously . A respected political insider recently told me most Americans were largely content with the status quo . “ The economy is in good shape , ” he said . “ Most Americans are better off than they ’ ve been in years . ”\nRecent economic indicators may be up , but those indicators don ’ t reflect the insecurity most Americans continue to feel , nor the seeming arbitrariness and unfairness they experience . Nor do the major indicators show the linkages many Americans see between wealth and power , stagnant or declining real wages , soaring CEO pay , and the undermining of democracy by big money .\nMedian family income is lower now than it was 16 years ago , adjusted for inflation . Workers without college degrees – the old working class – have fallen furthest . Most economic gains , meanwhile , have gone to top . These gains have translated into political power to elicit bank bailouts , corporate subsidies , special tax loopholes , favorable trade deals and increasing market power without interference by anti-monopoly enforcement – all of which have further reduced wages and pulled up profits .\nWealth , power and crony capitalism fit together . Americans know a takeover has occurred , and they blame the establishment for it .\nThe Democratic party once represented the working class . But over the last three decades the party has been taken over by Washington-based fundraisers , bundlers , analysts , and pollsters who have focused instead on raising campaign money from corporate and Wall Street executives and getting votes from upper middle-class households in “ swing ” suburbs .\nDemocrats have occupied the White House for 16 of the last 24 years , and for four of those years had control of both houses of Congress . But in that time they failed to reverse the decline in working-class wages and economic security . Both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama ardently pushed for free trade agreements without providing millions of blue-collar workers who thereby lost their jobs means of getting new ones that paid at least as well .\nThey stood by as corporations hammered trade unions , the backbone of the white working class – failing to reform labor laws to impose meaningful penalties on companies that violate them , or help workers form unions with simple up-or-down votes . Partly as a result , union membership sank from 22 percent of all workers when Bill Clinton was elected president to less than 12 percenttoday , and the working class lost bargaining leverage to get a share of the economy ’ s gains .\nBill Clinton and Obama also allowed antitrust enforcement to ossify – with the result that large corporations have grown far larger , and major industries more concentrated . The unsurprising result of this combination – more trade , declining unionization and more industry concentration – has been to shift political and economic power to big corporations and the wealthy , and to shaft the working class . This created an opening for Donald Trump ’ s authoritarian demagoguery , and his presidency .\nNow Americans have rebelled by supporting someone who wants to fortify America against foreigners as well as foreign-made goods . The power structure understandably fears that Trump ’ s isolationism will stymie economic growth . But most Americans couldn ’ t care less about growth because for years they have received few of its benefits , while suffering most of its burdens in the forms of lost jobs and lower wages .\nThe power structure is shocked by the outcome of the 2016 election because it has cut itself off from the lives of most Americans .

    "330": "( CNN ) - When Sen. Kelly Ayotte was defending her vote on Tuesday on a recent gun control proposal , she was confronted by the daughter of a victim in the Newtown , Connecticut , elementary school massacre .\nSpeaking at her first town hall event in New Hampshire since the gun vote earlier this month , the Republican senator sought to explain why she voted against a measure that would expand background checks on firearms sales .\nBut the crowd of gun control advocates and opponents created a tense environment .\nAt one point , Erica Lafferty , daughter of slain Sandy Hook principal Dawn Hochsprung , asked Ayotte why she voted against the background check amendment , which was created from a bipartisan compromise but failed to gain the 60 votes needed to move forward in the Senate .\nLafferty told Ayotte that on the day the senator voted , she said the legislation would be a burden on gun store owners , according to CNN affiliate WMUR . `` I 'm just wondering why the burden of my mother being gunned down in the halls of her elementary school is n't as important . ''\nA lone gunman opened fire at Sandy Hook last December , killing 20 children and six educators .\nLafferty was among the Newtown families who traveled to Washington this month to lobby senators to pass tougher gun laws . Only four Republicans voted against their party and in favor of the bipartisan compromise background check measure . One of them , Sen. Susan Collins of Maine , was among those who met with Newtown families before the vote .\nOn the day of the Senate vote , Lafferty told CNN she was disappointed but felt confident that the bill will rebound . Until then , she added , lawmakers will be held accountable .\n“ The next time there 's a mass shooting and they 're asked what they did to prevent it , they 're going to have to say nothing , ” she said .\nTaking a soft tone on Tuesday , Ayotte expressed condolences for the loss of Lafferty 's mother .\n`` I think that ultimately when we look at what happened in Sandy Hook we should have a fuller discussion to make sure that does n't happen again , '' the senator said . Ayotte argued the current system needed better enforcement .\n`` Mental health is the one area that I hope we can agree on going forward to work on because that seems to be the overriding issue on the list and that is why I have been trying to work across the aisle on that issue .

Joe Manchin of West Virginia , Angus King of Maine , Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Doug Jones of Alabama voted no with the Republicans .\nAhead of the vote , Senate Democrats blasted the vote as a “ sham. ” Democratic Party leaders said they believe Republicans used the vote as a political ploy to divide Democrats on a high-profile progressive idea . Instead , Democrats want members of the Republican leadership to schedule hearings rather than bringing the legislation straight to the floor for a vote .\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell denied earlier on Tuesday that the vote was a sham and , when asked by a reporter if he believed climate change to be real and caused by humans , he replied , “ I do . ”\nHe further challenged Democrats , “ If you believe the Green New Deal is the prescription for America , why would you not want to vote on it ? ”\nOn the floor , just before the vote , he added , “ I have to say , it ’ s remarkable enough to see a major political party coalesce around a proposal to forcibly remake the entire country according to what ’ s fashionable in Brooklyn and San Francisco , ” McConnell said . “ But it is even more stunning to see my colleagues so angry and upset at the opportunity to back up their new philosophy with their votes . ”\nMcConnell ’ s decision to hold a vote on the deal suffered a blistering rebuke from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , D-N.Y. , a co-sponsor of the legislation .\n“ The Senate vote is a perfect example of that kind of superficial approach to government , ” Ocasio-Cortez said on Tuesday . “ What McConnell ’ s doing is that he ’ s trying to rush this bill to the floor without a hearing , without any markups , without working through committee -- because he doesn ’ t want to save our planet . Because he thinks we can drink oil in 30 years when all our water is poisoned . ”\nMcConnell has called the proposal a “ far-left wish list ” originating with the “ most radical , farthest-left members of the new House Democratic majority . ”\nIn a series of speeches , Republicans blasted the Green New Deal as “ wildly unrealistic ” and a “ radical environmental policy . ”\nThe wide-reaching proposal calls not just for a massive overhaul of the nation 's energy sector over the next 10 years , but also investments in the country 's education , infrastructure and health care systems and a redesign of the entire U.S. economy .\nProgressive Democrats and climate activists say the Green New Deal is the only plan proposed , so far , that is ambitious enough to have an impact to prevent the worst case scenario of global warming . Supporters frequently cite a recent United Nations climate report that warned some effects on the environment could become irreversible in the next two decades .\nUltimately , the Green New Deal focuses on the alarming findings of recent climate change reports -- increasing numbers of natural disasters like wildfires , droughts and floods which are reportedly the result of rising levels of greenhouse gases ; mass migration expected from affected regions ; more than $ 500 billion in lost output by 2100 -- and suggests drastic solutions , such as bringing greenhouse gas emissions down to net-zero .\nThe resolution also calls for 100 percent of U.S. energy demand to be `` clean , renewable and zero-emission '' and for a redesign of transportation systems nationwide in order to eliminate pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector .\n“ It ’ s time to move past ‘ gotcha ’ politics and on to a real debate on the bold action that is necessary to save our communities . Unfortunately , we can ’ t have a good-faith policy debate while one party remains a wholly owned subsidiary of the fossil fuel industry , ” Sen. Jeff Merkley , D-Oregon , who also co-sponsored the resolution , said in a statement Tuesday . “ We need bipartisan acknowledgment that this crisis is real ; that it presents an existential threat to our nation ; and that the only serious solution is to make the bold pivot from polluting fossil fuels to clean and renewable energy in the next dozen years . ” \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

Before the actual primaries , Biden consistently led in polls and Sanders performed well—and then the eventual voting followed this pattern , with early wins for Sanders and a comeback surge from Biden . The idea that any other candidate had a particularly likely shot at the nomination was always pundit-driven misdirection from a class of commentators demanding more interesting , intersectional characters , because the commentators themselves are more interested in identity-based diversity than the rest of the country .\nIndeed , the media stumped for Warren so hard that Vox 's Matt Yglesias recently had to write a post explaining to people why she was losing `` even if all your friends love her . '' By your friends , he meant friends of people like you , a reader of Vox . Yglesias famously described Vox 's audience as `` a graduate of or student at a selective college ( which also describes the staff and our social peers ) '' and lamented that `` if you assigned me the job of serving a less-educated audience [ I 'd ] probably need to think about how to change things up . '' He 's right ; outside the Vox bubble , there was little interest in the kind of cultural progressivism represented by Warren .\nAt present , Biden and Sanders are locked in a battle for delegates . Both men have a good shot at the nomination . But this was true a year ago as well . They were both better-known and better-liked than many in the media seemed to grasp , and an endless series of magazine covers , fluff pieces , and editorial board endorsements aimed at other candidates could n't make any difference whatsoever . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

    "334": "Establishment journalists claim that the Trump era has produced a “ golden age ” of journalism , but media coverage in 2017 was plagued with errors and “ bombshells ” that turned out to be anything but .\nCNN botched a major story in December when they alleged that Donald Trump Jr. was colluding with Wikileaks over stolen documents . CNN reported that a man named Mike Erickson emailed Trump Jr. on Sept. 4 , 2016 with a link to Wikileaks documents and the decryption key needed to access them . The network hyped the story as a major development in the Russia investigation .\nHowever , a copy of the email given to ███ showed that it was actually sent on Sept. 14 , 2016 , after the stolen documents had already been leaked to the general public . Furthermore , Erickson has no apparent ties to Wikileaks or Russia . The Washington Post identified him as the president of an aviation management company .\nTo this day , CNN has yet to explain how two different anonymous sources fed the network the wrong date .\nThe New York Times had to “ look into ” its own fake news when former FBI director James Comey questioned its reporting . The NYT claimed that U.S. intelligence officials intercepted communications between the Trump campaign and senior Russian intelligence officials in the year leading up to the election . Comey called the reporting “ almost entirely wrong ” and warned media outlets about relying on sources who don ’ t have a full understanding of “ what ’ s going on . ”\nIn the week leading up to the G20 summit in Hamburg , Germany in July , CNN anchors reported that President Trump would not be confronting Russian President Vladimir Putin about his country ’ s meddling in American elections . The CNN report — which relied on a single , anonymous source — turned out to be dead wrong .\nAn ABC News reporting error resulted in a stock market panic and the suspension of reporter Brian Ross earlier this month . Ross reported that former national security adviser Mike Flynn was prepared to testify that candidate Trump ordered him to make contact with the Russians .\nHours later , ABC clarified that Flynn wasn ’ t asked to contact Russia until after the election , during the Trump team ’ s transition period . The story quickly fizzled from Trump-Russia collusion to standard preparation for an incoming presidential administration .\nThree CNN employees resigned over a poorly-sourced story on the Trump transition team in June . Relying on a single , unnamed congressional source , CNN claimed that Trump adviser Anthony Scaramucci was under investigation over a meeting with a Russian banker that took place shortly before Trump ’ s inauguration . CNN retracted the story and apologized to Scaramucci after multiple parts of the report were proven to be inaccurate . ( RELATED : 7 Times CNN Botched The News In 2017 )\nBloomberg News was forced to correct a bombshell report in December that claimed Special Counsel Robert Mueller had subpoenaed Deutsche Bank records related to President Trump and his family . The story claimed that Mueller had “ zeroed in ” on Trump . Bloomberg later corrected the report , noting that the bank records “ pertain to people affiliated ” with Trump , not the president himself .\nCNN broke another flawed bombshell in May . Attorney General Jeff Sessions , while applying for his security clearance , had failed to disclose two meetings with then-Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak . CNN described the story as “ the latest example of Sessions failing to disclose contacts he had with Russian officials . ”\nCNN quietly walked back the scoop seven months later , noting that the FBI specifically told Sessions he wasn ’ t required to disclose the meetings . In other words : CNN ’ s report excoriated Sessions for simply following protocol .\nJournalists at multiple outlets , specifically CNN , consistently pushed the false claim that Republican donors had originally funded the infamous Trump-Russia dossier . Republican donor Paul Singer funded the firm behind the dossier , Fusion GPS , to conduct opposition research on candidates including Trump during the GOP primary . However , Singer had no involvement in the dossier , which has played a central role in the Trump-Russia narrative .\nAs former FBI Director James Comey geared up for a congressional testimony in June , CNN found the perfect opportunity to make some bold — but incorrect — predictions . CNN reported that Comey would testify that he did not tell Trump he was the subject of an investigation , as it would be improper for him to do so . CNN was proven drastically wrong when Comey released his prepared testimony , complete with the confirmation that he assured the president that he was not under FBI investigation .\nA number of media outlets , including The New York Times , CNN , ABC News , and the Associated Press spent the year perpetuating a false claim Hillary Clinton made during the 2016 presidential debates . Each outlet incorrectly reported that “ all 17 intelligence agencies ” agreed that Russia meddled in the election .\nThe truth is only four intelligence agencies evaluated and made judgments about Russian interference because the rest , like the Department of Energy and the Drug Enforcement Agency , have little authority on the matter .\nNBC News published what the network hyped as a “ potential bombshell ” in September . Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort ’ s notes from the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer contained the word “ donations ” near a reference to the Republican National Committee , the network reported .\nNBC began walking back the anonymously sourced story almost immediately , before a report in Politico debunked the “ bombshell ” altogether . Despite what NBC ’ s sources told the network , the word “ donations ” did not appear in Manafort ’ s notes , which weren ’ t considered to be damaging to the Trump team at all .\nIn August , The New York Times “ obtained ” and published a draft of the National Climate Assessment ( NCA ) , quoting anonymous scientists who feared “ the Trump administration could change or suppress the report. ” There ’ s just one problem : despite the paper ’ s fear mongering , the draft report had already been publicly available for months .\nReports about “ fake news ” on Twitter turned out to be fake news themselves . CNN reported that “ fake news ” was higher in swing states , citing a study from the Oxford Internet Institute . However , the researchers in the study never talked about “ fake news , ” but rather “ junk news ” that apparently comes from mainstream conservative outlets like the Washington Examiner . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

    "336": "Statistics from the most recent Gallup poll indicate that Americans ’ moral views have become increasingly liberal over the past 14 years , with U.S. citizens tending to approve of behavior they would have deemed immoral or sinful just a generation ago .\nThe biggest change percentage-wise has been in Americans ’ positive moral evaluation of polygamy and human cloning , both of which more than doubled since first measured by Gallup in the early 2000s . In 2003 , a mere 7 % thought that polygamy was morally acceptable , whereas in 2015 , the figure has grown to 16 % . Similarly , the recent poll found that 15 % of Americans now accept human cloning , up from just 7 % of the population in 2001 .\nApproval of gay and lesbian relations has also soared in the same time period , with an absolute majority of 63 % of the population now seeing nothing wrong with this behavior , as opposed to 40 % in 2001—an increase of 23 percent .\nIn 2001 , a majority of 53 % of U.S. citizens already approved of fornication , and this group has continued to swell also , with 68 % now viewing sex between unmarried people as morally unproblematic . The study found , in fact , that in nearly all of the 16 categories compared , Americans ’ moral views had shifted left , with the exception of only two : the death penalty and scientific experimentation on animals .\nUnsurprisingly , the leftward shift in Americans ’ moral views has been matched by a corresponding loss of religiosity . A recent Pew Center study on religion in the United States found that despite America ’ s reputation as one of the more religious countries in the world , it has experienced a notable dip in religiosity in the past seven years .\nThe religious category to take the biggest hit was Christianity , especially “ mainline ” Christianity , which fell by 3.4 percent . Though the United States is still a statistically “ Christian nation , ” with about 70 % identifying themselves as followers of Jesus , it is markedly less so than even a generation ago .\nEvangelicalism , on the other hand , saw significantly smaller losses than mainline Protestant churches , dropping less than one percent of its adherents during this same period . Those identifying as Evangelicals fell from 26.3 to 25.4 % for a total loss in membership of just 0.9 % .\nThough it is impossible to establish a strict causal relationship between the two phenomena of moral liberalism and declining religiosity , the correlation between them is still striking .\nWhat may not seem immediately apparent is why as Americans become increasingly progressive , they are abandoning liberal religious denominations in favor of conservative ones .\nOne theory , advanced by Arthur E. Farnsley II , a professor of religious studies at Indiana University , is that the more churches resemble society at large in terms of their moral teachings and understanding of the meaning of human existence , the less relevant they are . Why continue to attend church services to hear the same message you get from reigning culture ? Religion only makes a difference when it offers an alternative account of reality , distinguishable from secular culture .\nIt is , in fact , the countercultural religious groups that are holding on to their membership .\nFarnsley suggests , therefore , that the more liberal religious groups will continue to lose members and influence “ because they are already on the modernist side , meaning many of their core values are expressed in other institutions , including government . ”\nMuch of the decline in membership for mainstream Christianity seems to be the result of a loss of recognizable Christian identity in those churches . Four particular phenomena stand out in this trend away from Christian tradition .\nIn the first place , mainstream Christian churches have shifted focus from the worship of God to social justice issues . As churches have moved away from a God-centered vision to a human-centered approach , they have come to resemble many other philanthropic institutions with no particularly religious character . As churches look more and more like humanitarian associations , the allegiance of their members has dropped correspondingly .\nA second discernible phenomenon has been the unmooring of mainstream Christianity from its biblical roots . Many Christians seem to find Christ ’ s moral teachings increasingly embarrassing in an age that is tolerant of virtually any consensual human behavior . Abandoning a more literal approach to biblical morality , many have reinterpreted even the clearest biblical doctrines to make them resemble societal trends . As sociological criteria have replaced biblical principles as a moral guide , the Bible has been reduced to a source of “ spiritual inspiration. ” Having lost their belief in the power of the Bible to teach moral truth , many have drifted away from Christianity altogether .\nA third development has been a shift in emphasis from eternity to the here and now . Traditionally , Christianity placed greater importance on the “ salvation of souls ” than on the immediate benefits of religion , meaning that more attention was given to the “ eternal truths ” of final judgment , heaven and hell , than to the psychological rewards of faith . As mainstream Christians have abandoned talk of eternity in favor of secular concerns , they have found that “ secular ” solutions seem better suited to meet their needs .\nA final trend among mainstream Christian churches has been a progressive lowering of the moral bar , seemingly out of fear of appearing “ judgmental ” or “ hypocritical. ” Confusing judgmentalism with the ability to tell right from wrong , many Christians have moved in the direction of withdrawing disapproval from all but the most egregious sins . The lower the bar , the fewer fail to get over it : “ I ’ m okay . You ’ re okay. ” Similarly , some have confused hypocrisy with a simple failure to live up to one ’ s moral ideals , and have embraced the facile solution of chucking their ideals . Hypocrisy , in fact , becomes impossible when one no longer endorses any moral standards .\nWhat all this means for the future is uncertain , but there are no signs of a reversal of the liberalizing trend any time soon . It seems , rather , to be gaining momentum .\nThe message for churches , however , seems relatively clear . For those who wish to hold on to their members and possibly even attract new ones , a recovery of a clearer Christian identity is indispensable , even at the risk of appearing countercultural . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

    "339": "Like him or not — and I can argue it both ways — established constitutional processes have hoisted Donald J. Trump atop the presidential plinth , where he stands now , getting ready to run things . Insofar as anybody runs anything anymore .\nThe latter point — the semi-chaotic nature of 21st century social and political life — is one we might fix on as we figure out what we ’ re in for these next four years .\nHere is my guess : We are “ in for ” market-driven reforms led by an entrepreneur who will show us , as all entrepreneurs must in due course , whether he ’ s as good at execution as he is at salesmanship . Donald Trump , businessman , is the figure to keep your eye on : not Donald Trump , master manipulator ; or Donald Trump , political visionary ; or Donald Trump , true and faithful patriot . We have chosen for president a man of the marketplace , with a highly tuned sense of what works and what doesn ’ t .\nThis moment has been coming on us for a while . Ross Perot was its herald . He intended , if you recall , to “ get under the hood ” and tune up the national engine . That was a quarter of a century ago . Times aren ’ t as good now as they were then . Trump ’ s objectives , like America ’ s local and international enmeshments , are larger : vanishing industrial jobs , terrorism , energy , urban decline , immigration , police relations , health care , retirement policy , and so on . He wants , in his brash , ultra-capitalistic way , to smash some old stuff by way of making new stuff ; stuff that works . It ’ s what capitalists do .\nSo what ’ s the matter around here ? This inaugural address reference to national “ carnage ” ; the repeated pledges to “ make America great again ” — less in Reaganesque city-on-a-hill fashion than America seen as a thriving , well-functioning , and most of all free community . What ’ s all that about ?\nIt ’ s the way in which numerous Americans see their country and the challenges , as well as opportunities , now facing it . Which is why so many Americans went to the polls last year and purchased , in essence , stock in a Trump comeback plan , its details sketchy , its vision encouraging or uplifting , depending on taste . Donald Trump sees himself as a national turn-around artist . Could that be plainer ?\nBut , as I asked a moment ago , what ’ s the matter ? Why the need for a turnaround — a need sensed by — I make bold to guess — all who voted for Trump ?\nThe matter is the failure of Western liberalism . Liberalism has the vitality , coupled with the dimensions and avoirdupois , of a beached whale . It doesn ’ t work . It lies there and flops about a little .\nLiberalism ( renamed “ progressivism ” after it ceased to connote freedom ) posits government — specifically , federal government — activity as the key to prosperity and happiness . If public schools no longer produce a “ winning ” ( as Trump might say ) product , throw more taxpayer money at them ; and then more . And let Washington , D.C. , and the teachers unions prescribe the standards . If tax policy discourages investment and leads to capital flight , let ’ s denounce tax cuts for “ the wealthiest 1 percent ” to keep from cutting the taxes paid by everyone else .\nLet ’ s tell consumers what kind of energy to use — and business what kind not to develop and produce . Let ’ s turn health care into a transaction between government and provider , with the patient mostly a bystander . Why worry about the assimilation — linguistic , occupational , cultural — of newcomers to America inasmuch as concern with assimilation probably reflects prejudice and nativism ?\nThe modern liberal/progressive project thrives on top-down control as opposed to the creative flexibility traditionally enjoyed by people at grass-roots level — to plan , to cooperate , to respond to real , as opposed to dreamed-up , needs .\nThe liberal/progressive project stems , it is fair to say , in part from well-motivated concerns as to genuine problems . Care for those in need is unmistakably a social duty . Care that , on the other hand , compromises freedom and mortgages the prospects of unborn generations is an outrage .\nNo one would argue — well , Donald might — that Donald has published with shining clarity his turnaround prospectus . But that , I think we should own , is what he ’ s up to — looking under the hood and throwing defective parts all over the landscape . I might not call it fun to watch . But fascinating ? We may never again see the like . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

    "341": "Believe it or not , but the incoming Trump administration is a godsend for California ’ s increasingly left-wing political leadership . Note how Democratic elected officials are tripping all over themselves , competing to make the most outrageous attention-grabbing boasts about their plans to fight against the new GOP presidency .\nSuddenly , these legislators face the prospect of relevancy , real or rhetorical . Until Trump ’ s ascension , California ’ s pols could hardly get much attention — except as weird left-coast folks determined to send their tax base to Texas . Even President Obama sometimes treated California the way one would treat a precocious child . But now things could become contentious as the nation ’ s most populous and liberal state becomes the test case for the fundamentally conservative idea that states are free to stand up to the federal behemoth .\n“ Donald Trump ’ s election was a shocking mistake of historical proportions . His dangerous ideas and policies threaten the freedom , the safety and the prosperity of every American , ” said Tom Steyer , the billionaire Democratic donor and possible gubernatorial hopeful at a California Democratic Party confab earlier in the month . “ This is our moment . We will rise to the occasion because there is no one else . ”\nNot to be outdone , Gov . Jerry Brown told the New York Times : “ I wouldn ’ t underestimate California ’ s resolve if everything moves in this extreme climate denial direction . Yes , we will take action. ” Brown said our state will launch its “ own damn satellites ” if necessary . “ We ’ ve got the scientists , we ’ ve got the lawyers and we ’ re ready to fight , ” he told the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco .\nSenate Majority Leader Kevin de Leon , D-Los Angeles , has vowed to fight Trump on stepped-up efforts to deport illegal immigrants . And local politicians have been rushing to pass “ sanctuary city ” resolutions that would limit the ability of police agencies to cooperate with the federal authorities . Some cities already do this , but others are joining the fray .\nOne of the driving forces of the state ’ s progressive politics is the idea that California is a special place where high-minded experts can implement policies that would be verboten in the rest of America ’ s rube-infested backwaters . I ’ ve listened to countless Assembly and Senate floor speeches , where legislators invoke California ’ s role as a world leader .\nIndeed , its first-in-the-nation cap-and-trade system wasn ’ t designed to improve the Earth ’ s climate , but to prod other states and nations into embracing similar policies . This attitude isn ’ t new , but it works best when there ’ s some outside enemy . Gov . Hiram Johnson , elected in 1906 , instituted our far-reaching brand of direct democracy to take on the railroads and robber barons , and his progressive vision has been a backdrop to our politics ever since .\nIn fact , the more we go our own way the happier our politicians seem to be . Officials in many other states are eager to build new highways and infrastructure to meet a growing population . Years ago , I recall Gov . Gray Davis boasting that the era of freeway building is over . As our traditional infrastructure becomes overburdened and downright dangerous , the state ’ s leaders are focused on spending more than $ 68 billion on a High Speed Rail boondoggle even though we already have a quick , inexpensive , and simple way to get from Los Angeles to San Francisco and other cities ( Southwest Airlines ) .\nSo we get to watch the Brown administration push forward a “ bullet train ” that won ’ t be particularly fast ( it is now planned to share rail lines with commuter trains in the L.A. basin and the Bay Area ) and doesn ’ t live up to most of the promises made to voters , who approved initial bond funding for the project in a 2008 initiative . But no matter . That ’ s the progressive way — the wise leaders know what ’ s best . If the citizenry complains about broken promises , then there ’ s always a way to overrule them through the bureaucracy or court system .\nObviously , California isn ’ t the only place where elected officials — Democrat and Republican — run roughshod over the lowly taxpayers , but we have elevated it to an art form here . The state is so large ( nearly 800 miles from Baja California to Oregon ) , populous ( 38.5 million people and growing ) , and economically powerful ( sixth in global ranking ) that its leaders often act as if they are leaders of a country rather than a mere state . Now they relish their chance to stand up to a hostile administration in Washington , D.C .\nNational publications have made sport of the Cal-Exit plan , but that ’ s just silliness . A group of progressives has been pushing a secession movement — an effort to actually break away from the United States and form a new country . That began before Trump , but the election has given it new impetus and attention . But there ’ s no way this is going to happen . Their proposed 2018 initiative wouldn ’ t be binding . Congress isn ’ t going to allow an exit from the United States under any scenario .\nPlans to break California into two or more states aren ’ t so crazy , from a policy standpoint . There ’ s nothing sacrosanct about our current arbitrarily created borders , and there have been myriad such proposals since California became a state in 1850 . But such ideas are not politically feasible . I doubt Congress would approve several new senators from the states formerly known as California , to mention just one major obstacle .\nFollowing the inauguration , California will continue to go its own way legislatively . A list of new laws for the new year include many of the various progressive fixations — more gun control , more aggressive climate-change targets , higher minimum wages and more employer mandates , new rules regarding bathrooms for transgendered people , higher smoking ages , etc . Expect more of the same , except that Democrats will have an easier time of things now that they control supermajorities in both houses .\nNone of that is anything new , but we could see some serious showdowns between the Trump administration and the newly energized California Democratic leadership over immigration policies and climate-change rules . The question is whether the new president will call California ’ s bluff . If he does , the face-offs could become entertaining . Will Brown and company stand firm if there ’ s a price to pay ? Will the state ’ s leaders be willing to lose federal immigration or transportation funding if they choose to thumb their nose at the feds ? Will federal immigration enforcement insist on having access to , say , gang databases and other records ? If so , might we see county sheriffs — or even Gov . Brown — standing on courthouse or jailhouse steps refusing access to federal agents ? The possibilities are endless . I wouldn ’ t bet on any profiles in courage here in Sacramento , but our state might find itself in the center of the national political conversation for the first time in years . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

Apparently , this also included Ivanka Trump and White House Senior Adviser Jared Kushner — whose displeasure is regularly leaked to the media .\nThe New York Times ’ Glenn Thrush reported this week , via an anonymous source , that Kushner and Ms. Trump had urged the president to denounce the white nationalist protesters “ more forcefully. ” Thrush reported the news just after Trump had defended his recent statements .\n“ You look at both sides .

    "344": "Britain voting to leave the European Union next month could trigger a wave of similar freedom movements across Europe and effectively “ liberate ” the continent , and control from Brussels is not unlike former Communist rule from Moscow for many , Dutch Freedom leader Geert Wilders has said .\nSpeaking to Britain ’ s Sunday Telegraph , Eurosceptic and counter-Islamification campaigner Mr. Wilders said Britain would lead by example by voting to leave the European Union , and in doing so would “ liberate Europe ” for the second time in a century , making clear reference to Britain ’ s key role in resisting German expansionism during the Second World War .\nMr. Wilders said : “ Like in the 1940s , once again Britain could help liberate Europe from another totalitarian monster , this time called ‘ Brussels ’ . Again , we could be saved by the British… If people see that a country can leave , and the lights do not go out , there is not a war , and a country does not go bankrupt , but even flourishes . If Britain proves that this theory can become a reality , it would have an enormous effect . ”\nSeveral countries are thought to be likely candidates for similar referendums to Britain , should she succeed in her bid to break free from the Union . Austria and Poland are thought to be possibilities , and Mr. Wilders added the Netherlands to the list .\nSpeaking of the ‘ Patriotic Spring ’ coming in Europe , a reaction to the authoritarian and undemocratic European Union , Mr. Wilders said the “ genie ” of populist , pro-freedom politics was “ now out of the bottle ” .\nMr. Wilders leads the Netherland ’ s Party for Freedom , and frequently uses the metaphor of spring blossoming to describe an awakening interest in the West in self-determinism , freedom , and national identity . His party consistently tops the polls in Holland , yet the other parties in parliament , both mainstream and alternative , shun him as a pariah and have sworn to keep him out of government even if he forms the largest party at next year ’ s elections .\nWriting exclusively for Breitbart earlier this year , he hailed a ‘ Patriotic Spring ’ and drew comparisons to 1980s Communist Europe , when “ Poland struggled to be Poland ” . Mr. Wilders wrote he saw the same thing happening in Europe and the United States again today .\nOn the spreading discontent with the centralisation of political authority in Brussels , Mr. Wilders said yesterday the Eastern European states were most sensitive to totalitarianism , having only recently liberated themselves . He remarked :\n“ The eastern Europeans have already experienced what it is like to live under totalitarianism , they know what Moscow rule meant . Nobody knows that better than the Poles , the Czechs the Slovaks and the Hungarians .\n“ So they know , when they see another totalitarian monster – this time it ’ s dressed up a little differently ; this time it ’ s called Brussels instead of Moscow – but it still wants to take their national sovereignty and identity and change their country . And people are saying : ‘ enough is enough ’ . ”\nBrexit isn ’ t the only forthcoming political event Mr. Wilders has a keen eye on . Citizens of Austria voted yesterday to elect a new president , in a straight run-off between a left-Green candidate and right-wing populist Freedom Party candidate Norbert Hofer .\nThe latest counts last night showed the pair perfectly matched at 50 per cent each , with just the postal votes to count this morning . Mr. Wilders said of the contest :\n“ Just like a Brexit , a Freedom Party victory would be an enormous incentive for people all over Europe to see that we are not parties on the fringe of politics , that we are not only the biggest party in respective countries but even provide the head of state , the elected President .\n“ It ’ s a reality and you ’ d better face it and deal with it . This will be the future in many European countries ” .\nMr. Wilders ’ remarks echo those he made in an exclusive interview with Breitbart London last year . When asked on his thoughts about the British referendum on the European Union — at that point still 18 months away — Mr. Wilders said :\n“ I am inspired by the British referendum , and I hope it will inspire the rest of Europe when Britain votes to leave the European Union . You are lucky enough to be out of the Eurozone – in Holland we have had billions in austerity measures , taxes being raised , just to pay for the countries in Southern Europe who are unwilling to raise taxes . It is a wealth transfer union .\n“ The European project has very little support outside of the political elite . Holland is like the United Kingdom , with so many laws coming from the European Union instead of our parliament or cabinet . Europe should be a continent of nation states who are free trading , with our own identities , not a bunch of Eurocrats nobody voted for .\n“ I really hope the people of the United Kingdom don ’ t vote against Europe – but vote against the European Union !

    "345": "A once-upon-a-time voice for journalistic respectability — the Columbia Journalism Review — has consigned to the well-known hot place the notion that respectability entails letting voters rather than reporters decide whether a president is Abe Lincoln or a dirty lying rat . The Review rather leans to the latter conclusion .\nThe Review ’ s daily , always ( to me ) absorbing look at media goings-on raises the question of how to talk about , well , a lying rat of a president : a distinction most media institutions have awarded Donald Trump . The Review highlights the New York Times ’ efforts to call Trump a liar without actually calling him one .\n“ Trump Falsely Says Times Made Up Source in Report on Korea Summit Meeting. ” That would be just one example of journalistic efforts to downplay the President ’ s commitment , such as it is , to the Truth that Makes You Free . The Journalism Review quotes Times White House Reporter Maggie Haberman ’ s disparaging Tweet the other day : “ Trump told two demonstrable falsehoods this AM . ”\nThe Review says “ the argument consumed political media conversations on Twitter for much of the weekend. ” Some Twitterists thought Haberman ’ s charge a little mild . On May 28 came the Times ’ charge that “ He Uses Conspiracy Theories to Erode Trust . ”\nHere we go again , trying , as a society , as a culture , to make heads or tails of a president who defies efforts to categorize him . Over the uproar concerning his gift for veracity or falsehood , alarm bells should sound . The anti-Trump media are nuts if they think they ’ re improving their status in 21stcentury life . They ’ re undermining it further : deepening national disarray by abandoning standards more necessary than ever before in public life .\nMay it please the court , reporters and editors have neither right nor duty to show up the president as a liar . It ’ s lousy journalism to try . But oh , such modern journalism ! Which is the problem .\nLook : The media are our eyes and ears . Our brains they aren ’ t , though our media clearly suppose the opposite . Which supposition makes them try to lead mere viewers and readers by the nose : telling them what to think . Good luck with that ! “ Speaking truth to power ” — an old Quaker ideal beloved of modern Thought Leaders — involves telling Trump voters they laid an egg . What a non-fruitful mode of argumentation and discussion .\nThe President ’ s grasp of facts is his own , certainly . But :\n1 ) He ’ s not always wrong , even when being obnoxious ; and\n2 ) a statement out of line with the truth doesn ’ t suggest the need to go at him , as per the Times , with eyes bulging ; rather , it demands bringing to view — without indignation or contempt — asseverations and facts that undermine the Trumpian account . Only you set such asseverations and facts side by side with his own : quoting responsible , preferably neutral , or neutral-ish , sources . You let the White House answer those sources . Then you stand back and let the people make up their own minds !\nStrange conceit , that — trusting votes and consumers of news to make up their minds without pointed assistance from the media . For which , if it doesn ’ t work out , maybe we need to examine the U.S. education system with more alarm . And maybe also the lack of trust that previous media forays against previous presidents have engendered .\nMedia fury at one Donald Trump is sowing worrisome consequences for the future . The lying so-and-so , as most of the media view him , is going to be gone one day : possibly with the media ’ s invaluable assistance . And will there linger , save in progressive circles , any public inclination to believe , or even listen to , a word the anti-Trump press says about anything ? Including the weather ?\nA certain… call it mutual trust , or sense of shared conviction , lies at the foundation of any free society . I can not see the anti-Trump media adding to our depleted storehouse of trust . I see , indeed , the media ’ s angry judgmentalism — its love of crying “ Liar ! ” — making things far angrier , far more divisive , than they are now . And what we have right now isn ’ t great .

    "347": "When Hillary Clinton claimed “ 17 intelligence agencies ” agree on Russian meddling in the third presidential debate , a host of media outlets including The New York Times rated the claim as 100 percent true . Nine months later , those same outlets say the stat is obviously false , and there ’ s been a “ simple ” explanation as to why all along .\nA closer look at how the claim survived and thrived over those nine months reveals a startling lack of skepticism in the press when it comes to the Russia narrative . The truth is the great majority of the 17 agencies that make up the U.S. intelligence community had nothing to do with the investigation and made no judgments about the matter .\n“ The reason the views of only those four intelligence agencies , not all 17 , were included in the assessment is simple : They were the ones tracking and analyzing the Russian campaign , ” The New York Times now reports . “ The rest were doing other work . ”\nStrange admission for the paper , since its star political reporter recently reiterated the false claim as she was in the middle of writing an article characterizing President Trump as stubbornly foolish .\n“ The latest presidential tweets were proof to dismayed members of Mr. Trump ’ s party that he still refuses to acknowledge a basic fact agreed upon by 17 American intelligence agencies that he now oversees : Russia orchestrated the attacks , and did it to help him get elected , ” Maggie Haberman wrote . Her story was later corrected to reflect the — basic fact — that only three agencies working under the Director of National Intelligence contributed to the intelligence community ’ s conclusion .\nA few days later , the Associated Press echoed that correction in a “ clarification ” bulletin acknowledging there ’ s no truth to the claim the wire service had repeatedly blasted out for publication to news outlets all over the world .\nThe bizarrely timed corrections put the media in a bit of a truth pickle , especially after Trump drew attention to the corrections at a high-profile press conference in Poland . “ They had to apologize , and they had to correct , ” he noted .\nThe New York Times , CNN and others quickly spun up articles and tweets aimed at steering the conversation away from this uncomfortable truth about their proliferation of an outright false claim , and back to the more comfortable “ isn ’ t Trump an idiot ? ” narrative .\n“ 17 intel agencies or four ? Either way , Russia conclusion still valid , ” Politifact wrote in a Thursday headline . “ Trump still doesn ’ t seem to believe his intelligence agencies , ” CNN blared .\nThe New York Times took it a step further , dismissing the truth of the claim as a “ technicality ” and then accusing Trump of spreading a “ misleading ” narrative by correcting the record . Their headline on a story about Trump calling them out for pushing a bogus claim : “ Trump Misleads on Russian Meddling : Why 17 Intelligence Agencies Don ’ t Need to Agree . ”\nBut that uncomfortable truth remains . The “ 17 intelligence agencies ” embellishment is frighteningly easy to catch . A cursory glance of the DNI website would show the truth . More importantly , the sheer length of time the falsehood stood in public record at the highest echelons of media betrays an astounding lack of scrutiny on other points in the Russia narrative , which are often sourced to political operatives and anonymous “ officials . ”\nLet ’ s look at how this happened , and what it says about the media ’ s overall credibility in the Russia collusion narrative , from the top .\nThe claim can be traced straight back to candidate Clinton in the third presidential debate , remarking on Russian meddling a few weeks after the DNI released a statement on the investigation . The press didn ’ t demonstrate any interest in the number of agencies that signed off on the Oct. 7 statement , until Clinton unleashed the “ 17 ” number in the debate ( other than a CNN report incorrectly claiming there are 19 intelligence agencies ) .\nShe was clearly trying to add some umpf to the DNI assessment and pour cold water on Trump ’ s skepticism about Russia ’ s attempt to influence the election . She even repeated the number twice , firmly planting it in the record .\n“ I think that this is such an unprecedented situation , ” Clinton said . “ We ’ ve never had a foreign government trying to interfere in our election . We have 17 , 17 intelligence agencies , civilian and military who have all concluded that these espionage attacks , these cyber attacks , come from the highest levels of the Kremlin . And they are designed to influence our election . I find that deeply disturbing . ”\n“ She has no idea whether it is Russia , China or anybody else , ” he replied , setting off a back and forth that would be reiterated over and over in the press as evidence he was in denial about Russian meddling . “ I am quoting 17 , 17 — do you doubt ? ” Clinton said , and Trump responded definitively : “ Our country has no idea . … Yeah , I doubt it . I doubt it . ”\nJournalists highlighted the talking point on Twitter as they covered the debate . And the fact checks came rolling in . The New York Times , Politico , ABC News , Politifact and PBS all rated the claim as totally true the night of the debate . Before the night ended The New York Times was using Clinton ’ s number with authority in its reporting , saying in a debate wrap up that Trump had “ refused ” to acknowledge “ the unanimous conclusion of America ’ s 17 intelligence agencies . ”\nThe following day the number popped up in reports from Politico and Defense One , quickly divorced from its context as a debate talking point and transformed into an indisputable fact attached to Trump-Russia stories .\n“ The Office of the Director of National Intelligence collects and coordinates for the President the information and analysis from the 17 agencies that make up U.S. national intelligence collection , ” a line in the Defense One report on “ Trump ’ s Denial ” stated .\nPolitico hadn ’ t previously used the 17 figure in reporting on Russian meddling , but now framed it as common knowledge that Clinton had to “ explain ” to Trump : “ As Clinton tried to explain that the Russian role is the finding of 17 military and civilian intelligence agencies , Trump cut her off : ‘ I doubt it . ' ”\nThe fact checks continued to roll in . USA Today wrote a particularly aggressive check on the claim headlined “ Yes , 17 intelligence agencies really did say Russia was behind hacking. ” The article confidently asserted , “ Clinton is correct . ”\nAll of these “ fact checks ” and reports were wrong , of course , as has since been made ultra clear . As The New York Times now concedes , the truth about her claim was obviously false from the start . Any reporter capable of operating Google could have looked up a list of the intelligence agencies in question , and ruled out almost half in just minutes .\nThe Department of Energy , Treasury and Drug Enforcement agencies can be dismissed out of hand . The military service intelligence organizations can ’ t legally operate on U.S. soil . Add the Coast Guard and we ’ re tentatively at eight remaining intel agencies under DNI . The Defense Intelligence Agency is also unlikely . Geospatial intelligence ? Definitely not . National recon office ? Not unless a political influence campaign has something to do with a missile launch or natural disaster .\nThat leaves us with State Department intelligence , Department of Homeland Security , FBI , CIA and NSA . Five tops , narrowed down at the speed of common sense and Google .\nSure , the October DNI report was presented as the conclusion of the intelligence community , which does consist of 16 separate agencies headed up by the DNI . At first glance , her claim might seem perfectly reasonable to someone unfamiliar with the makeup of the intelligence community . But it ’ s journalistic malpractice to do a fact-check level review of her claim that each agency separately reviewed and judged the campaign , without so much as hinting at the obvious likelihood that most of them weren ’ t involved .\n“ All 17 U.S. Intelligence agencies believe the Russians are behind that leak , ” ABC host George Stephanopoulos told Trump in an October interview . “ Why don ’ t you believe it ? ”\n“ [ Trump ] has consistently denied any link between the hackers and the Kremlin , despite 17 intelligence agencies ’ claims to the contrary , ” the Daily Beast reported that same day .\nNBC News dropped Hillary ’ s number nugget in a December report on the Obama White House asking the intelligence community for a dossier on the hacking assessment . The resulting report would be shared with the public , White House counterterrorism advisor Lisa Monaco said at the time .\n“ Monaco used careful language , calling it a ‘ full review of what happened during the 2016 election process , ' ” NBC reported . “ But since the U.S. government has already said that all 17 intelligence agencies agree Russia was behind the hacks , Monaco ’ s meaning was clear . ”\nReuters , too , touted the number in a December report that characterizes the DNI as a “ 17-agency strong ” operation .\nThe declassified DNI report that followed in January provided new details on the assessment that dumped ice-cold water on the “ 17 intelligence agencies agree ” claim . The conclusion was drawn only from the NSA , CIA and FBI , the report said . ( The New York Times conceded this in a break down of the report , although the claim would later make its way back into the paper ’ s pages . )\nA few months later former national intelligence director James Clapper reiterated the truth in a high-profile congressional hearing about Russian interference , opting to correct the record without any partisan prompting .\n“ As you know , the I.C . was a coordinated product from three agencies ; CIA , NSA , and the FBI — not all 17 components of the intelligence community , ” he said in his opening remarks . “ Those three under the aegis of my former office . ”\nAnd when Democrat Sen. Al Franken reiterated the false claim later in the hearing , Clapper once again made a point of correcting the record .\n“ The intelligence communities have concluded — all 17 of them — that Russia interfered with this election , ” Franken said . “ And we all know how that ’ s right . ”\nClapper interjected : “ Senator , as I pointed out in my statement , Senator Franken , it was , there were only three agencies directly involved in this assessment , plus my office . ”\n“ Well , we didn ’ t go through that , that process , ” Clapper replied , again shooting down the claim as utterly false . “ This was a special situation because of the time limits … we decided … to restrict it to those three . ”\nSo not only was the assessment only made by three of the 16 agencies working under the DNI , but also Clapper indicated here that none of the other agencies even signed off on the report before it was released . Yes , none of them dissented . But why would they , since they didn ’ t have independent evidence to suggest otherwise ?\nAt this point in the life of Hillary ’ s debate talking point , there ’ s just no credible way to rate the claim as true . The DNI report made the truth explicit , and Clapper had now reiterated that truth in a very public setting .\nYet just a few weeks later Clinton unabashedly reiterated the “ 17 agencies agree ” claim in an interview with the tech outlet recode , and as if on cue the media once more began spreading it around .\n“ Read the declassified report by the intelligence community that came out in early January , ” Clinton said . “ 17 agencies , all in agreement – which I know from my experience as a senator and secretary of state is hard to get – they concluded with ‘ high confidence ’ that the Russians ran an extensive information war against my campaign to influence voters in the election . ”\nA little while later the bogus claim showed up in an AP report , after ███ News Foundation fact checked Clinton ’ s claim in the interview and found it false . And then twice more in June before the “ clarification ” memo was published . Stephanopolous was back at it as well in a June 11 interview with Republican Sen. Mike Lee . And then that Haberman report in The New York Times on the 25th echoing the claim , which was rather strangely corrected four days later .\nAfter all this , CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta actually accused Trump on Thursday of pushing “ fake news ” by saying the conclusion only came from “ three or four ” agencies . “ Where does that number come from ? ” Acosta asked .\nAnd all the time , the tweets from journos eager to harp on the Trump-Russia narrative kept coming .\nThe timing of the AP and NYT corrections are a bit of a mystery , but for whatever reason the press is now collectively saying Trump is correct in his push back on the “ 17 agencies ” claim . And that ’ s got the narrative a bit tangled . After initially doubling down on the “ true ” rating of Clinton ’ s debate claim , Politifact is now bizarrely also rating the claim mostly false in a separate fact check .\nSo we ’ re left with that uncomfortable truth . The establishment press uncritically “ vetted ” and embraced a Clinton campaign talking point designed to make Trump look foolish , divorced it of its political context and reiterated it word-of-God style for more than six months — all the time either ignoring or missing entirely easily obtainable information proving it false — and then suddenly reversed course on the claim weeks after it was unambiguously and authoritatively debunked .\nWe live in a world where r/the_donald — a Reddit thread teeming with Trump supporters — proved more shrewd than The New York Times and the Associated Press when vetting an important claim about the Russia investigation .\nThe truth about this “ 17 intel agencies ” claim matters , not so much because of what it says about the intelligence community ’ s conclusion on Russian meddling , but because of what it says about the establishment media ’ s conclusion on Russian meddling .\nHaberman and her ilk seem intent on casting Trump as a loner bordering on a nervous breakdown , maniacally watching the news at all hours , hollering at staff and generally acting like a buffoon . And there ’ s the almost daily implication that Trump personally coordinated a hacking campaign with Russia , an implication grounded in no hard evidence despite a lengthy investigation .\nThe fact is many of these narratives bear all the same hallmarks as the “ 17 intelligence agencies ” mess .\nSources often appear to be politically motivated , like Clinton . They show up in bizarre numbers , like “ dozens ” or “ more than 30. ” Anecdotes seem almost questionable at face value . An astonishing number of hastily reported or vaguely sourced “ scoops ” turn out to be totally wrong when the subject of the story corrects the record .\nIn a report casting the White House as fraught and bordering on collapse , Haberman wrote that Trump likes to stew over cable news in a bathrobe . The White House refuted the anecdote in no uncertain terms the following day .\nBased on the word of one anonymous source , The Washington Post reported that Russia had hacked the U.S. electrical grid . That was quickly proven false when the electric company , which the reporter had not bothered to contact before publishing , said in a statement the grid definitely was not hacked , and the “ Russian hacker ” may have been no hacker at all , but an employee who mistakenly visited an infected site on a work computer .\nCNN reported that Former FBI Director James Comey would refute Trump ’ s claim the director told him three separate times he was not personally under investigation . Comey did no such thing . In fact he corroborated Trump ’ s account .\nJust weeks after retracting a story on a wealthy Trump associate and Russia , CNN insisted for days Trump would not ask Putin about Russian meddling during their first meeting . Of course , the report depended on an anonymous source . Of course , it was wrong . One of the first things Trump did when he sat down with Putin was “ press ” him on the subject multiple times , according to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson , who was in the room .\nWe could go on , but the point remains . The media is bent on supporting already foregone conclusions about Trump and Russian meddling , no matter what they have to scoop up or parrot or claim ( or ignore ) to do so . Sure , it ’ s a “ basic fact ” Russia meddled in the election . But for the media , it ’ s also just a “ basic fact ” that Trump likely colluded with Russia , and that he should be impeached , and that his White House is on the verge of literally disappearing into a sinkhole .\nThe facts they use to support these conclusions might as well be irrelevant . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "348": "During an April 2 interview with Chris Wallace on Fox News , Surgeon General Jerome Adams compared deaths caused by COVID-19 to deaths caused by smoking and drug abuse . `` More people will die , even in the worst projections , from cigarette smoking in this country than are going to die from coronavirus this year , '' he said .\nWallace questioned the analogy . `` Dr. Adams , '' he said , `` there 's a big difference between opioids and cigarettes , which are something that people decide to use or not to use , [ and ] the coronavirus , which people catch . It 's not an individual choice . ''\nThe distinction that Wallace considered commonsensical is not one that public health officials like Adams recognize . As they see it , their mission is minimizing `` morbidity and mortality , '' whether those things are caused by communicable diseases or by lifestyle choices .\nEquating true epidemics with metaphorical `` epidemics '' of risky behavior distracts public health agencies from their central mission of protecting people against external threats such as pollution and pathogens . It undermines their moral authority by implying that the rationale for that uncontroversial mission also justifies a wide-ranging paternalism , and it damages their credibility by involving them in high-handed , manipulative propaganda .\nThe ambiguity about what it means for the government to protect public health also makes it harder to think clearly about the limits of state power in responding to literal epidemics . The classical liberal tradition has always recognized that the state has a legitimate role to play in protecting the public from contagious diseases . When we are confronted by an actual public health crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic , the question is not whether the use of force can be justified but whether a particular policy is appropriate . That question is hard to answer when there is a high degree of uncertainty about the threat posed by the disease and the cost of limiting its spread .\nBefore the new coronavirus came along , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) spent a lot of time and effort warning us about a very different kind of `` epidemic '' : an increase in e-cigarette use by teenagers , coupled with an outbreak of vaping-related lung injuries . The first concern did not involve any sort of disease ; the latter did , but unlike COVID-19 , the condition that the CDC dubbed `` e-cigarette , or vaping , product use-associated lung injury '' ( EVALI ) was not contagious . And contrary to the CDC 's misleading nomenclature and dangerously misguided initial advice , the two developments appeared to be completely unrelated .\nEven under a broad understanding of public health , the CDC 's conflation of EVALI with vaping in general was counterproductive , impeding the harm-reducing shift from conventional cigarettes to nicotine delivery systems that are far less dangerous . By fostering confusion about the relative hazards of smoking and vaping , the CDC hurt its own credibility on the eve of a public health crisis in which policy makers and the rest of us were expected to rely on its expertise .\nAs Chris Wallace probably would agree , vaping is something people choose to do . In that respect it resembles many other phenomena that politicians , bureaucrats , and academics have described as public health problems , including smoking , drinking , illegal drug use , overeating , physical inactivity , riding a motorcycle or bicycle without a helmet , gambling , playing violent video games , and watching pornography . COVID-19 , by contrast , is something that happens to people .\nThere is a strong argument for coercive measures to deal with a potentially deadly disease that moves from person to person . That argument is much less compelling when we are talking about actions that may lead to disease or injury but do not inherently endanger other people .\nThe tendency to describe nearly anything that large numbers of people do as an epidemic when others view it as pernicious elides this crucial distinction . If protecting public health is presumed to be a legitimate function of government , an open-ended definition of that term is a prescription for constant political meddling in personal choices through taxes , regulations , prohibitions , and state-sponsored nagging . Likening choices to contagious diseases invites the government to act as if those choices , and the personal tastes and preferences underlying them , are morally no more important than a microorganism 's evolutionary imperative to reproduce by infecting human hosts .\nOnce a particular pattern of behavior has been defined as an epidemic , that framing can lead to policies that make no sense even if you accept the collectivist calculus at the heart of public health as it is currently understood . That is what happened with vaping , which the CDC was predisposed to view as problematic , a prejudice that colored its depiction of EVALI . Even though it was clear early on that vaping-related lung injuries overwhelmingly involved black-market cannabis products , the CDC repeatedly intimated that legal , nicotine-delivering e-cigarettes might kill you . That message endangered public health by falsely implying that people—teenagers as well as adults—would be safer if they smoked .\nOnly belatedly did the CDC recalibrate its guidance to focus on the potential hazards of THC vapes , `` particularly from informal sources like friends , family , or in-person or online dealers . '' It also foregrounded a warning that `` adults using nicotine-containing e-cigarette , or vaping , products as an alternative to cigarettes should not go back to smoking '' —advice that surely is equally sound for teenagers who vape instead of smoking .\nWhen the CDC switched gears from vaping to COVID-19 , its habit of misleading people , ostensibly for their own good , was still evident . The agency 's initial advice about face masks and virus tests gave the public false assurances regarding the danger posed by the epidemic while discounting the lifesaving value of those protective tools .\nUntil early April , the CDC advised most Americans against wearing face masks in public . `` If you are sick , '' the agency originally said on its website , `` you should wear a facemask when you are around other people ( e.g. , sharing a room or vehicle ) and before you enter a healthcare provider 's office . '' But `` if you are NOT sick , '' it added , `` you do not need to wear a facemask unless you are caring for someone who is sick ( and they are not able to wear a facemask ) . Facemasks may be in short supply and they should be saved for caregivers . ''\nAfter much criticism , the CDC revised its recommendations , telling people to `` cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face cover when around others . '' It explained the shift by citing the risk of asymptomatic infection , a phenomenon that scientists had been describing for months .\nLike the CDC 's face mask recommendations , its COVID-19 testing criteria were driven by a shortage—in this case , a government-engineered shortage . At first the agency monopolized testing , and the kits it shipped to state laboratories in early February were defective . The CDC and the Food and Drug Administration initially blocked researchers and businesses from developing or conducting tests , which aggravated a shortage that made it impossible to get a handle on the size and severity of the epidemic in its early stages .\nMaking a false virtue of necessity , the CDC set irrationally narrow criteria for testing , initially restricting it to symptomatic travelers from China and people who had been in close contact with them . As of late April , it was still saying that `` not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19 . ''\nThe truth was that everyone—or at least representative samples—did need to be tested , both for the virus and for the antibodies to it . That was the only way for policy makers to get a clearer sense of how prevalent the virus was , how quickly it was spreading , how lethal it was , and how many people had developed immunity to it . Without wide testing , they could only guess at those vitally important variables , even as they were making policy decisions with potentially devastating economic consequences .\nWhile it was giving bad advice about face masks and tests , the CDC was projecting COVID-19 deaths based on a model that counterfactually assumed the absence of voluntary measures such as hand washing , working at home , avoiding crowds , and limiting social interactions . Such worst-case scenarios , which had a strong influence on state and federal policies , presented a false choice between doing nothing and imposing the sort of sweeping restrictions that we began to see across the country in March : orders closing `` nonessential '' businesses and instructing Americans to remain at home except for `` essential '' work or life-sustaining errands .\nAnother obvious option was the targeted use of isolation and quarantine , coupled with contact tracing , to protect the public from known or suspected disease carriers . But that approach was foreclosed by the test kit shortage , which made it impossible to do the screening that such a strategy requires . And because meager testing resources left state and local officials ignorant of crucial facts about the epidemic , they made policy decisions without the evidence necessary to assess their proportionality or cost-effectiveness .\nThe general case for using force in response to outbreaks of contagious illnesses is straightforward . Someone who carries a potentially lethal pathogen , like someone who dumps toxins into the water or air , endangers other people . Government responses to that threat clearly fit within the justification for state action limned by classical liberal philosopher John Stuart Mill in his 1859 essay On Liberty : `` The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community , against his will , is to prevent harm to others . His own good , either physical or moral , is not a sufficient warrant . ''\nMill 's principle distinguishes between the broad and narrow conceptions of public health as a license for government intervention . It rules out paternalistic policies such as alcohol prohibition ( which he opposed ) while allowing the exercise of power over individuals ( such as disease carriers ) who pose a direct threat to others .\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has long recognized that states have broad authority , under their general `` police power , '' to protect the public from communicable diseases . `` Real liberty for all could not exist under the operation of a principle which recognizes the right of each individual person to use his own , whether in respect of his person or his property , regardless of the injury that may be done to others , '' the justices observed in Jacobson v. Massachusetts , a 1905 decision that upheld mandatory smallpox vaccination .\nBut the Court also said public health authority has limits : `` An acknowledged power of a local community to protect itself against an epidemic threatening the safety of all might be exercised in particular circumstances and in reference to particular persons in such an arbitrary , unreasonable manner , or might go so far beyond what was reasonably required for the safety of the public , as to authorize or compel the courts to interfere for the protection of such persons . ''\nState quarantine laws , which include safeguards aimed at protecting the rights of alleged carriers , reflect that balance between protecting the public and respecting individual freedom . The quarantine regulations in Washington , the first state to report a COVID-19 outbreak , illustrate the tension between those two goals .\nUnder Washington 's regulations , a local health officer can obtain a court order requiring isolation or quarantine by showing there is a `` reasonable basis '' to believe it is `` necessary to prevent a serious and imminent risk to the health and safety of others . '' Those orders last up to 10 days but can be extended up to a month , based on `` clear , cogent , and convincing evidence that isolation or quarantine is necessary to prevent a serious and imminent risk to the health and safety of others . ''\nThere are several restrictions on that authority . The health officer must first make `` reasonable efforts , which shall be documented , to obtain voluntary compliance '' or else determine , `` in his or her professional judgment , '' that `` seeking voluntary compliance would create a risk of serious harm . '' The rules also specify that `` isolation or quarantine must be by the least restrictive means necessary '' to prevent the spread of a communicable disease .\nThe health status of individuals subject to orders `` must be monitored regularly to determine if they require continued isolation or quarantine , '' and they `` must be released as soon as practicable '' when the health officer determines that they no longer pose a threat . Isolated or quarantined individuals have a right to petition for release , with the assistance of court-appointed counsel , in which case the government has to `` show cause '' for their continued detention .\nSuch due process protections are not merely theoretical . In 2014 , Kaci Hickox , a nurse who had treated Ebola patients in Sierra Leone , successfully challenged a three-week home detention order issued by Maine 's Republican governor .\nTo meet the standard set by Maine 's quarantine law , the state had to present `` clear and convincing evidence '' that Hickox posed a `` public health threat '' and that a 21-day quarantine was `` the least restrictive measure '' to deal with it . Charles LaVerdiere , chief judge of the Maine District Courts , ruled that any potential threat posed by Hickox , who had tested negative for the virus , could be adequately addressed by `` direct active monitoring '' to detect the onset of symptoms should she become ill . Since Hickox `` currently does not show any symptoms of Ebola and is therefore not infectious , '' LaVerdiere said , forcibly confining her to her home was not justified .\nTargeted quarantines like the one that Hickox challenged are a far cry from the stay-at-home orders that state and local governments issued in response to COVID-19 . Those policies were not based on an allegation that any particular individual or group posed a public health threat , and it 's likely that the vast majority of the people affected by the orders were not actually carrying the virus .\nIn early March , a week before local and state governments began imposing COVID-19 lockdowns , Vox asked Lindsay Wiley , a health law professor at American University 's Washington College of Law , about the legality of such policies . Wiley said `` a mandatory geographic quarantine '' would `` probably be unconstitutional under most scenarios '' but noted that the issue had never been squarely addressed .\n`` The courts would typically require government officials to try voluntary measures first , '' Wiley explained , `` as a way of proving that mandatory measures are actually necessary . Furthermore , any mandated measures would have to be narrowly tailored and backed by evidence….To pass constitutional muster , an order not just urging but requiring all people within a particular area to stay home would have to be justified by strong evidence that it was absolutely necessary and that other , less restrictive measures would be inadequate to slow the spread of disease . ''\nAround the same time , Cornell law professor Michael Dorf noted the disjunction between lockdowns and the standards prescribed by quarantine and civil commitment laws . `` In normal times , the government may not confine people for the public safety absent 'clear and convincing evidence ' that they pose a danger to themselves or others , '' he wrote in a Verdict essay . `` One would hope that during a pandemic the courts would construe that standard on a population basis rather than one by one . Thus , while there may not be clear and convincing evidence that any particular asymptomatic individual poses a threat , there is such evidence for the population as a whole . ''\nEven if it were possible to make such a judgment about `` the population as a whole , '' it would require evidence concerning the prevalence of the COVID-19 virus that policy makers did not have when they imposed the lockdowns . Without early and wide testing , politicians had no idea how many Americans were infected , let alone how prevalence varied from one part of the country to another . For the same ███ , they did not know how lethal the virus was , a factor that surely should figure in decisions affecting the liberty and livelihoods of so many people .\nThere is historical precedent in the United States for trying to reduce the spread of disease by legally restricting social and economic activity . During the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic , for example , St. Louis banned public gatherings and closed schools , movie theaters , and pool halls . San Francisco shuttered `` all places of public amusement . '' But the restrictions of that era were not as pervasive or as broad as the measures implemented in response to COVID-19 , which confined hundreds of millions of people to their homes except for government-approved purposes .\nLockdown supporters thought the experience with the 1918 epidemic reinforced the case for more aggressive and uniform measures . They argued that cities like St. Louis and San Francisco fared better than cities like Philadelphia , which acted later . If more cities had imposed broad restrictions early on , they suggested , the death toll from the pandemic—which ultimately killed some 50 million people worldwide , including about 675,000 in the United States—might have been lower .\nThey may be right about that . But if the effectiveness of those measures remains unclear a century later , what chance did state and local officials have of making wise decisions about COVID-19 in the heat of the moment without knowing how many people were carriers , how many were asymptomatic , how many had developed immunity , or how many could be expected to die from the disease ? Uncertainty about those basic facts made it impossible to properly weigh the costs and benefits of the course they chose .\nEven as it rejected the plea of a man who objected to mandatory smallpox vaccination in Jacobson , the Supreme Court allowed that judicial intervention might be appropriate when regulations go `` far beyond what was reasonably required for the safety of the public . '' But as politicians across the country shut down the economy this spring and ordered people to stay home until further notice , they did not have the information required to make that judgment . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

In 2013 , shortly after she left the State Department , Clinton gave a Denver-based company — Platte River Networks — control of the server , and it was moved to a data center in New Jersey.This week , the FBI seized the server , which was apparently wiped clean . Last week , the bureau took a thumb drive from Clinton lawyer David Kendall that contained copies of Clinton 's work-related emails.Morris thinks Clinton acted in a `` reckless '' manner . Reports have said top secret content about drones passed through Clinton 's email . `` Who 's the one who 's in charge of deciding what 's secret and what 's not ? Hillary Clinton . So if the documents came and they were unclassified , unmarked , it was her duty to mark them and to respect that marking , '' Morris says . `` Obviously , drones and the kind of information you 're talking about would be top secret . Hillary was reckless in consigning all this to her personal server because of the very material that the Secretary of State deals with . I believe the evidence will be so overwhelming that she violated the protocols that I do n't think they 're going to have any choice but to go after her . `` Morris sees Clinton getting `` forced out of the race , '' which will open the door for several other Democrats with presidential aspirations . `` I see her being indicted , I see her being forced out of the race , I see [ Vice President Joe ] Biden running and I see a lot of pressure ramping up on other Democrats like [ Secretary of State John ] Kerry and [ former Vice President Al ] Gore and Deval Patrick in Massachusetts and a bunch of others , Elizabeth Warren , to get into the race . Not as opponents of Hillary but as understudies . `` Morris underscores his point in a separate interview on `` ███ Prime . `` `` The magnitude of the evidence is going to be so overwhelming that it ’ ll be impossible not to indict her , '' Morris says . `` So yes , I do believe Hillary Clinton will be indicted and will be forced out of this race . `` Months before Clinton announced her candidacy in April , she had a significant lead in every major national poll over her potential challengers for the Democratic nomination at the time . But with the layers of the email scandal being peeled back rather quickly now , her poll numbers are taking a hit . Clinton 's main challenger at this point , Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders , is still well behind her but is making up ground . Others , such as former Maryland Gov . Martin O'Malley and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb , who are already in the race , could see a boost in their poll numbers if Clinton were to exit . There 's also talk Biden will join the race . Bloomberg reported Thursday that the FBI is now investigating whether the data on Clinton 's email server may have been backed up somewhere else . A former Justice Department prosecutor said the FBI might be able to recover data from a server that has been erased . `` Most people do n't understand really what it takes to actually delete things from a computer permanently , '' former computer crimes prosecutor Peter Toren told Bloomberg . `` The FBI has had a great deal of training and they 're very good about recovering data from computers that people think have been erased or deleted . `` Donald Trump , who leads the crowded field of Republicans vying for the nomination , said this week he thinks the race for the White House will come down to himself and Biden . `` I think Hillary has got huge problems right now , '' Trump said . `` Is she going to make it ? I hear this thing is big league . Why did she do it ? You use the server ? Because [ the Clintons are ] always looking to go over the edge , whether it 's Whitewater or anything else . They always want to go over the edge . `` I 'm just looking at it saying , 'What the hell was she doing ? You know what she was doing ? She was guarding from the president seeing what she doing .

    "351": "Robert Gates , shame on you for not having the moral courage to do what is right . Yesterday Gates , the president of Boy ... Posted by Franklin Graham on Friday , May 22 , 2015\nThe Rev . Franklin Graham , the prominent evangelist , denounced Boy Scouts of America President Robert Gates on Friday and accused him of putting children at risk with his call for an end to the organization 's ban on openly gay scoutmasters . `` Robert Gates , shame on you for not having the moral courage to do what is right , '' Graham wrote in a Friday post on Facebook that had received more than 40,000 `` likes , '' 11,000 comments and had been shared by more than 10,000 people as of Friday evening.Graham , son and successor of famed televangelist Billy Graham , was reacting to remarks by Gates on Thursday at the scouts ' annual meeting in Atlanta.The former secretary of defense , now the scouts ' top official , called the ban unsustainable — reversing an earlier promise to steer clear of the issue . `` We must deal with the world as it is , not as we might wish it to be . The status quo in our movement 's membership standards can not be sustained , '' he said on Thursday.Gates said he did not plan to revoke the membership charters of any local troops known to have gay adults in supervisory roles , an apparent reference to a New York chapter hiring an openly gay scoutmaster this spring . `` What are you thinking ? '' Graham wrote in response to Gates . `` We should n't shift as the winds of cultural change blow through society ; we need to stand for God 's truth and things that are morally right . `` This move is bending to LGBT activist groups and would put young , innocent boys at risk , '' wrote the president and CEO of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and Samaritan 's Purse , an international Christian charity . `` I encourage every former Boy Scout and every parent involved in the Boy Scouts to let Robert Gates know how displeased you are and that if he leads the organization down this road , they may lose your support , your participation — and your sons , '' he wrote.Gates said he was not asking the organization 's board to make an immediate policy change at the annual meeting . `` But I must speak as plainly and bluntly to you as I spoke to presidents when I was director of CIA and secretary of defense , '' he said.At the Pentagon , Gates oversaw the repeal , beginning in 2011 , of `` Do n't Ask , Do n't Tell , '' the Clinton-era compromise policy that has now given way to openly gay service members in the U.S. armed forces.Gates was elected to a two-year term as the Boy Scouts ' president in 2014 , after the organization voted in 2013 to allow openly gay scouts.He said at the outset that his preference was to also allow gay scoutmasters , but that he would not broach the issue during his term for fear of causing a `` formal , permanent split '' in the organization , Think Progress reported at the time.In the same address at last year 's annual meeting in Nashville , Gates said recruitment had declined in part because of negative publicity surrounding the ban.Prominent companies including aerospace giant Lockheed Martin and Walt Disney have ended longstanding partnerships with the scouts in protest of the ban.Advocates for gay scouts cheered Gates ' remarks while others with ties to the organization were ambivalent , the Los Angeles Times reports . `` It 's one of those things I was hoping I would n't have to think about for years to come , '' said David Barton , an Orange County , California , cubmaster and father of two boys in scouting , told the Times.Barton told the Times that it `` would be silly to think that a higher percentage of gay men want to do harm to boys than straight men , '' but that he still has concerns about gay scout leaders accompanying boys on camping trips . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

    "354": "Did you see this Wall Street Journal front-page headline on Monday ? It read , “ Profits Soar as Economy Advances. ” That headline will probably be the most important headline of the week . It certainly is of colossal importance . Our economy is robust . The rest of the world is not doing so well , for instance , China . Yet our economy is unusually healthy . If we have to engage in a trade war , it is an auspicious time for us to do so . President Donald Trump has deployed an array of policies and appointments that are serving the country very well . Apparently the prophet Obama was in error when he said employers have “ learned to do more with less . And so they don ’ t hire . And as a consequence , we keep on seeing growth that is just too slow to bring back the eight million jobs that were lost . ”\nYou , however , were probably distracted by such headlines as this : from the Washington Post ’ s front page , “ Trump Defends Son ’ s ’ 16 Meeting ” or this from the New York Times ’ front page , “ Trump Admits Meeting ’ s Aim : Tarnish Clinton. ” Then there were stories about the shopping mania of Paul Manafort , about his sidekick who is a sidekick no more , and , throughout the newspapers , stories about Donald and his family , none of them favorable but none of them as damning as the newspapers ’ editors would have you think .\nOf course , Donald Trump , Jr. and his associates sat down with a Russian source to hear what the source had to say about Hillary ’ s recent misdeeds . What candidate would not ? No woman in public life has ever accumulated so many scandals and instances of wrongdoing as Hillary . For that matter not many men have accumulated a record comparable to Hillary ’ s without going to jail . There is her relationship with the Clinton Foundation , her fundraising operation , and assorted problems such as Benghazi . In the months ahead , there would be her association with old friends and choice funders such as Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey . When one sits down to talk about Hillary , one is not anticipating a conversation about acts of faith , hope , and charity .\nOf course , there could also be revelations about Bill . He now seems to have gone underground . There is no talk of his getting out on the campaign trail for the Democrats . My agents tell me he is under the bed in Chappaqua hoping no new rape-victims or would-be Kathleen Willeys materialize . He is especially concerned about girls he met in Arkansas in the eighties who developed drug dependency problems before heading off to Florida to embark on lives of prostitution . How about if one of those girls develops a # MeToo itch ?\nThere have been three Constitutional crises in my lifetime and two of them revolved around the Clintons . The third revolved around Richard Nixon , and he was man enough to resign his office rather than put the country through an impeachment trial . Just as he was man enough to leave the outcome of the 1960 election uncontested after the votes from Texas and Illinois looked shady ( and still remain dubious to some historians ) . The Clintons pursued the crisis of Bill ’ s impeachment gamely , even though Bill had obviously lied under oath and obstructed justice . After all it was , as his supporters said , “ only sex ” … with a young woman half his age . Let him trot out that alibi today .\nThe second Constitutional crisis that the Clintons have manufactured for us is the crisis of the Russians ’ “ phantom ” collusion with the President . It involves prosecutors pursuing leads that go nowhere , but have taken almost two years to run down before our own Inspector Clouseau takes up another lead . At present Inspector Mueller is pursuing Donald Trump ’ s Tweets as though the Tweets were not uttered in a very public forum but rather were whispered in secret . The Russians wanted , we are told , to meddle in our elections . So now Inspector Mueller , the Democrats ’ mouthpiece Fusion GPS , an ex-British intelligence sleuth , and the Clintons are assisting them in just that , meddling in an American presidential election .\nHow did we arrive at this chaotic place ? I thought the source of criminality was Hillary and her server , not Donald and his son . Well , if you would like to know how we got here , lay your hands on Shattered : Inside Hillary ’ s Doomed Campaign . There on page 395 you will find a hung-over Hillary angry as hell the morning after her unexpected defeat . She directed her aides Robby Mook and John Podesta to assemble “ her communications team… to engineer the case that the election wasn ’ t entirely on the up and up… . Russian hacking was the centerpiece of the argument. ” This has been the Clintons ’ successful game plan ever since , though some of us have blown the whistle on it .\nThe origin of our present Constitutional crisis is a bit more complicated than this passage from Shattered makes out , but here is a good starting point to discover how the mob , the prosecutors , the media , and the Democratic Party are intent on stealing the last election and saving the Clintons ’ hides . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "355": "Of all the grievances erupting against Facebook executives Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg , perhaps the most telling is the complaint that , back in 2015 , they failed to suppress presidential candidate Donald Trump 's call for `` a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States . ''\nThis kvetch was expressed in a recent front-page The New York Times investigation , which griped , `` Trump 's call to arms—widely condemned by Democrats and some prominent Republicans—was shared more than 15,000 times on Facebook , an illustration of the site 's power to spread racist sentiment . ''\nThe complaint demonstrates the ever-expanding definition of the word `` racist . '' Muslims , after all , can be of any race . Anti-Muslim bigotry is wrong , and racism is wrong , but even if the two biases have much in common , that does n't mean they are the same thing . The Soviet Communists pioneered the use of the racism slur to tar political enemies , championing the 1975 United Nations General Assembly resolution declaring `` Zionism is a form of racism . '' The Soviet Union was defeated and the resolution eventually repealed , but the tactic , alas , endures .\nThe complaint also signals the persistence of the belief that the way to deal with offensive or incorrect speech is to smother it rather than to rebut it . This , too , is a view more compatible with totalitarianism that with freedom . It suggests an insecurity , a lack of confidence that one 's own ideas are strong enough to overcome alternative views . It leads to the establishment of central authorities with power to decide which views are acceptable for publication or broadcast , and which are not .\nRelatedly , the complaint betrays a low opinion of the American electorate .\nOne view of the situation might be , `` The American voters are n't bigots . If the voters see a politician making a racist appeal , that appeal is likely to backfire by hurting the candidate politically . Hiding the appeal just helps the racist politician by covering up his racist blunder . '' Call that the idealistic view .\nAnother view would be , `` The American voters are a bunch of bigots . If the voters see a politician making a racist appeal , that appeal is likely to help the candidate politically . Hiding the appeal hurts the racist politician by restricting his ability to communicate his racist message with the vast audience of racist voters . '' Call that the cynical view .\nFacebook and other large media organizations had an opportunity earlier this month for a re-do of this episode , or at least a chance to make a new decision about something arguably similar . This time around , they chose the suppression route . NBC , Facebook , CNN , and Fox News all in the end chose to reject a Trump campaign commercial that CNN described as `` racist . '' The ad featured the migrant caravan moving through Mexico and also a convicted cop-killer named Luis Bracamontes who is an illegal immigrant from Mexico .\nIn the critiques of the caravan-cop-killer commercial , as in those of the Muslim-ban Facebook post , there 's an expansive definition of racism . Hispanics , after all , can be of any race . Anti-immigrant bigotry is wrong , and racism is wrong , but that does n't mean they are the same thing . Here , too , there 's an implicit low estimation of American voters , a fear that they are so susceptible to racist appeals , so easily swayed , that they 've got to be kept far away from such a commercial . And there 's a quaint reliance on the idea of central authority—as if , just by preventing this ad from airing on CNN , Facebook , and Fox News , it 's also going to be somehow kept off YouTube , or Twitter , or email , or newspaper front pages .\nBoth the Muslim ban and the caravan ad go to genuine political issues—the threats of extremist Islamist terrorism , of illegal immigration , and of violent crime . These are issues that both parties have struggled to solve completely . Declaring peremptorily that voters concerned about such issues are racist , that these issues are outside the bounds of acceptable discourse , or that emotional appeals by political candidates on these issues should be suppressed seems a recipe for a politics that is even more volatile . It 's `` basket of deplorables '' and `` bitter clingers , '' the domestic politics of contempt all over again .\nThat does n't mean that there are n't some real racists out there , or that businesses ca n't choose for themselves to impose standards for acceptable advertising . But it does mean that those who have a real interest in promoting tolerance , or reciprocity , toward immigrants , whether Mexican or Muslim , might do that cause some service by examining their own biases and stereotypical assumptions about their fellow American voters .\nIra Stoll is editor of FutureOfCapitalism.com and author of JFK , Conservative . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

But though the night is still young in terms of the GOP 's latest return to power , Republicans have quickly demonstrated that I should have trusted my usual pessimism , because it 's clear that they 're not guided by any principled support for limited government .\nThough a few congressional Republicans sincerely believe in markets and freedom , the party is largely dominated by pretenders and outright statists . One need only look back to when Republicans last controlled Washington . Republicans and the George W. Bush administration massively increased spending and the federal debt .\nMilitary spending skyrocketed to pay for dubious wars . Corporate welfare , including farm subsidies , thrived . The federal government became more involved in what should be local matters , such as education . And civil liberties were trampled on under the guise of `` homeland security . '' The GOP not only failed to tackle unsustainable growth in federal entitlement programs but also expanded them by creating Medicare Part D .\nAn amazing thing happened , though , when Barack Obama was elected and the Democrats regained control of Congress . Republicans suddenly remembered the horrors of federal overspending , mounting debt and the endless intrusion by the federal government into every aspect of our lives . Republicans lambasted the notion that Keynesian-style big-government spending would boost the economy . They decried Obamacare and the Democrats ' love for `` socialized medicine . '' They bemoaned continuous growth in federal debt and conveniently laid the problem at Obama 's feet .\nThen another amazing thing happened : Donald Trump was elected , and the GOP was once again in charge . Almost immediately , Republicans began touting increased military and infrastructure spending to create jobs and spur the economy—the very Keynesian-inspired policies they attacked when advocated by Democrats . Even the small number of federal program terminations proposed by the Trump administration were too much for congressional Republicans . Nope—when it comes to the federal budget and yet another looming brush-up against the federal debt ceiling , Republicans reveal that they 're content to maintain an untenable status quo , despite all the lip service paid to the dangers of big government over the years .\nYes , as part of the failed attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare , the GOP did include Medicaid reforms intended to slow the spending growth for the federal/state entitlement program that provides health care for those with lower incomes . There are many problems with the program , which is in dire need of reform . But the same can be said about Medicare and Social Security , which congressional Republicans—and Trump , for that matter—have made clear they wo n't touch . ( Remember then-vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan 's emotional attack on President Obama for allegedly cutting Medicare during the 2012 campaign ? )\nWhat about the GOP 's supposedly bread-and-butter issue of tax reform ? Regardless of how big or small the positive economic feedback to any tax cuts would be , the bottom line is that serious , permanent spending cuts must be part of the equation . But as we have repeatedly seen , Republicans are so unwilling to shrink the size of government that they already waved the white flag and are actively advocating a new source of revenue to `` pay for '' tax reform . Indeed , I fear that the recent fight over the inclusion of a border adjustment tax to generate revenues is only the beginning . At the rate we 're going , it may not be long until the GOP gets on board with a value-added tax or carbon tax !\nFor all of the GOP 's deriding of Democrats over the years for being `` tax-and-spenders , '' the sad reality is Republicans are on their way to earning the same label . We might only be six months into the return of Republican rule , but it 's already looking as if this second go-round of Republican control in Washington this century could end up being as disastrous—if not more—than the first one . But as the saying goes , fool me once , shame on you ; fool me twice , shame on me . I do n't intend to be fooled twice , and I hope I 'm not alone . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

Antonia Okafor rose to prominence because of her recent NRA ad , “ I Didn ’ t Listen . ”\nIn this exclusive video interview for ███ News Foundation , she says she voted for Obama believing the false and dominant narrative being peddled through the black community that “ just because he looks like me , he is best for me. ” She then realized that “ his policies are harming me , not helping me. ” Now , she votes for policies , not the person . She casts herself as a black conservative and is optimistic about Trump ’ s policies .\nThe Trump victory , she thinks , was a broad cross-section of Americans of all races saying “ enough ” to the false narratives and overused labels being thrown at political opponents . As for the labels being thrown at GOP Sen. Jeff Sessions , Trump ’ s nominee for attorney general , Okafor says they only remind her of the disturbing and ridiculous labels given to her , like “ racist , misogynist and sexist ” or “ deplorable ” for voting for Trump .\nCountering feminists , too , Okafor has worked with Students for Concealed Carry and been a passionate leader for more concealed carry policies on campuses as a means of personal empowerment , especially for young women . Besides being a frequent guest on Tomi Lahren ’ s popular show at The Blaze , she is now a journalist with the Independent Journal Review where her focus is on liberal bias on college campuses .\nOkafor is “ sad and disappointed ” with Obama ’ s failures as the first black president . Instead of being a peacemaker , he gave license to a “ dangerous narrative ” that hateful people can do anything to whites because of their skin color . She hears others believing and promoting this disturbing belief , a belief reflected in the “ heartbreaking ” Chicago Facebook live video of the four blacks who tortured a white special needs boy .\nInstead of unifying America , Obama has “ agitated ” to the point where others call for “ race wars ” because of the power and control progressives can wield if certain voices , facts and logic can be marginalized , she explains .\nOkafor has lost many friends for shifting her worldview , and was even been surrounded by a hostile , threatening Black Lives Matter mob in Austin , Texas , that chanted “ traitor ” at her . The pushback she receives only seems to strengthen her resolve to think , use facts and logic and help others . She is optimistic that with one-on-one conversations , more lives and worldviews can be changed , as opposed to the “ shout-fest ” occurring on social media .\nOkafor knows there are many who would try to keep voices like hers silenced or marginalized because she has the capacity to credibly offer a differing point of view from the elite narratives being driven through the media . She may even be headed to law school .\nFor more on Antonia , see her Facebook page and follow her on Twitter at @ antonia_okafor .\nMrs. Thomas does not necessarily support or endorse the products , services or positions promoted in any advertisement contained herein , and does not have control over or receive compensation from any advertiser . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "362": "Donald Trump Jr. outed Eric Ciaramella as the whistleblower this week as much as I presently out Mark Felt as Deep Throat . But it advances the narrative to say that he did , so fake news — an apt if overused description for outlets that do not let facts get in the way of a good story — report that he did .\n“ I can not express the horrifying impact of @ DonaldJTrumpJr and @ BreitbartNews to expose the whistleblower for pure retribution , ” reporter Kurt Eichenwald tweeted . A Vanity Fair headline read , “ Of Course Donald Trump Jr. Outed the Alleged Whistle-Blower. ” Even a Drudge Report headline screams , “ Junior Outs the Whistleblower. ” That another Drudge headline , “ Report : Whistleblower Exposed , ” preceded it by more than a week rebuts the notion that Trump Jr. outed anyone .\nTrump Jr. tweeted a headline , “ Alleged ‘ Whistleblower ’ Eric Ciaramella Worked Closely With Anti-Trump Dossier Hoaxer , ” of a story appearing on the 68th most-read website in the United States , Breitbart , which generates more traffic than the Washington Post , Politico , or the Daily Beast . In other words , Trump tweeted material not only already in the public domain but also appearing on one of the most widely read news sites in this country . Beyond this , the Breitbart story appeared a week after Paul Sperry of RealClearInvestigations wrote this October 30 piece — itself preceded by tweets and blog posts identifying the whistleblower — that points to Eric Ciaramella , a 33-year-old CIA analyst , as the government worker who alleged criminal wrongdoing by Trump to Adam Schiff ’ s staff .\nThe Sperry piece generated a massive amount of discussion . This column focused on it , and the bizarre taboo on saying the words “ Eric Ciaramella , ” a week ago . Rush Limbaugh , the most listened-to voice on the radio airwaves , similarly mentioned Ciaramella . “ There have been all kinds of publications that have mentioned the whistleblower ’ s name , ” he explained earlier this week . “ He has been outed by any number of conservative publications . His picture has been published . He ’ s known . Everybody knows his name ! But look , everybody ’ s still talking like the guy hasn ’ t been outed , like the guy hasn ’ t been identified . He has been . But where ? See , until the mainstream media does it , it hasn ’ t happened ! See how this works ? ”\nAtop feigning that the president ’ s namesake revealed Ciaramella as the leaker , the narrative maintains that naming a whistleblower violates not only law but also morality . Whistleblower statutes protect government workers from repercussions . They do not command journalists , or even most members of the government , to provide them anonymity . Even NPR affirmed that the president publicizing the whistleblower ’ s identity would not constitute a crime . “ Similarly , ” NPR continued , “ if a news outlet , member of Congress or member of the public outed the whistleblower , legal experts said , no criminal law would be violated . ”\nThe Constitution , silent on the matter of whistleblowers , speaks clearly that “ the accused shall enjoy the right … to be confronted with the witnesses against him. ” Whether this extends beyond criminal trials to impeachment trials remains open to debate . But in hiding the key witness — the guy who catalyzed the entire crisis — Democrats obstruct justice . As Devin Nunes explained to Tucker Carlson Wednesday night , the whistleblower ’ s charges represent “ hearsay from a supposed somebody who we ’ ve never met . ”\nWhy does Adam Schiff not want us to meet the whistleblower ? Why did Twitter suspend Donald Trump Jr. ’ s account on Wednesday for mentioning his name ? Why do news outlets claiming that “ democracy dies in darkness ” keep the democracy in the dark about Eric Ciaramella ?\nBecause the Trump White House deported him back to the CIA in 2017 when officials suspected that he leaked information for the purpose of damaging the president , because he worked for Joe Biden , John Brennan , Susan Rice , and others committed to removing this president from office , because , as Mike Cernovich wrote more than two years ago , “ Ciaramella helped draft Susan Rice ’ s anti-Trump talking points before the Inauguration , ” because Ciaramella invited Ukrainian-American activist Alexandra Chalupa , who tried to dig up dirt on Trump abroad in 2016 , to the White House , and because a dozen or more other reasons .\nThe president ’ s antagonists do not want us to know the whistleblower ’ s name because his identity reveals him not as a whistleblower but as an antagonist . Removing his anonymity poses a threat not to Ciaramella but to the project , termed a “ coup ” by his attorney two years ago , he joined to remove the president by any means necessary . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "363": "There was a reason that FDR opposed the unionization of public sector workers . Rather than the natural negotiation tension between a company owner and an employee in which the owner is trying to conserve his capital while the employee across the table tries to get as much as he can , when a politician or bureaucrat is negotiating with a public sector union , they ’ re both on the same side of the table , spending taxpayers ’ money , usually without a taxpayer representative anywhere nearby . It ’ s a recipe for fiscal disaster and perhaps national economic suicide .\nThe same is true , as proved this weekend , when Republicans and Democrats , having colluded to put off legislation needed to “ keep the government open ” until the waning days of existing federal spending authority , crafted a “ deal ” in which taxpayers are utterly betrayed . Government by emergency is never good for the taxpayer , and this emergency was , as so many are , a product of bipartisan conspiracy .\nRepublicans ( notwithstanding President Donald “ No Entitlement Reform ” Trump ) market themselves as the party of fiscal restraint . But once “ last-minute ” negotiations begin on a spending bill under the guise of “ we can ’ t have a shutdown , ” the Republican walks around from his side of the table , sits next to the Democrat , gives him a big hug , and says “ I ’ ll vote for yours if you vote for mine . ”\n( For those interested in an insider ’ s look at how this machine works , I recommend Congressman Ken Buck ’ s new book , Drain the Swamp : How Washington Corruption Is Worse Than You Think . )\nThe result ? A trillion-dollar deal to fund government for the remaining five months of this fiscal year in which Democrats and Republicans , or more precisely the big-spending subset of Republicans , each get a few items on their wish lists and taxpayers get shafted .\nThe Trump administration wanted an additional $ 30 billon for the Defense Department . They got a $ 12 billion increase , enough to begin making up for Barack Obama ’ s shameful disregard for our national defense .\nTeam Trump also wanted $ 3 billion for additional “ border security , ” but got half of that amount , again enough for the time being . Importantly , this money is not for a border wall ; that particular Trump desire was abandoned during this “ negotiation. ” [ UPDATE : During a Tuesday press conference , OMB Director Mick Mulvaney claimed that some of this money will in fact be used for a “ 20-foot high steel wall , ” just not a brick-and-mortar wall , adding “ that ’ s what Democrats don ’ t want you to know . ]\nWhat else did the GOP give up ? Any effort to remove federal funding of Planned Parenthood . Any effort to penalize “ sanctuary cities. ” Any effort to substantially reduce funding for any department of the federal government .\nOne truly bipartisan spending priority was included : An additional $ 650 million to fight the nation ’ s opioid epidemic . A worthy cause though I doubt the money will be used to great effect . But the rest of the “ bipartisanship ” looks like a Democratic dream come true :\n$ 295 million to bail out Puerto Rico ’ s imminent Medicaid insolvency .\nThe Department of Energy ’ s “ Department of Science , ” an office that President Trump ’ s recent “ skinny budget ” proposed to cut $ 900 million from , received a $ 42 million budget increase .\nThe DOE ’ s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy got a $ 17 million increase . Algore can ’ t believe his luck .\nThe 21 st Century Community Learning Centers program , which the Trump budget zeroed out , gets a $ 25 million increase to roughly $ 1.2 billion for this fiscal year .\nCentury Community Learning Centers program , which the Trump budget zeroed out , gets a $ 25 million increase to roughly $ 1.2 billion for this fiscal year . The bill gives a $ 550 million spending increase for “ disadvantaged students ” under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ( and only a $ 9 million increase for federal charter school initiatives because Democrats hate charter schools ) .\nAnd saving the best for last : The “ bipartisan agreement ” includes $ 2 billion of increased funding for the National Institutes of Health . If this doesn ’ t prove that the DC definition of “ bipartisan ” is Republicans accepting Democratic positions , nothing does .\nThe NIH ’ s budget is around $ 32 billion . President Trump has proposed a $ 5.8 billion cut to NIH funding . And yet , once Republicans finished their hard bargain with the party that doesn ’ t control anything in the federal government , the NIH received a bigger increase in funding than border security did .\nDo you think that is what Trump voters thought they were getting ? And yet it ’ s clear that President Trump will sign this disastrous , immoral , unprincipled bill .\nSo let ’ s go back to politics , shall we ? There are only two possible explanations for these results :\nRepublicans were massively outmaneuvered ( again ) by Chuck Schumer . Many Republicans are all talk when it comes to fiscal responsibility .\nOK , it was a trick question ; the answer is , of course :\nLet ’ s remember how this game is played : Democrats and Republicans agree to wait until the last minute to make a deal , forcing both of them to abandon their stated priorities in order to “ get to yes ” quickly . “ Please , ” the Republican faux-conservative says to the Democrat , “ don ’ t make me vote for that NIH funding increase. ” “ Please , ” says the Democrat , “ don ’ t make me vote for your border security in exchange. ” It ’ s political “ Br ’ er Rabbit ” in the big-spending briar patch .\nBoth sides claim that the risk of a government “ shutdown ” is unacceptable , allowing Republicans to excuse their sinful burdening of my children and yours , and generations to come , with hundreds of billions of dollars in additional debt with each passing year . ( Democrats don ’ t try to excuse themselves for it ; they just claim that they ’ re “ investing . ” )\nBut do the people of the United States really give a rat ’ s posterior if the government “ shuts down ” ? People cared so little last time that Barack Obama closed the World War II Memorial just to make people feel some pain , a move that backfired spectacularly . Whatever anti-GOP short-term movement in the polls occurred reversed itself rapidly .\nAnd this time , Republicans would , more credibly than at any time in recent memory , be able to argue that a shutdown is the fault of intransigent Democrats .\nInstead , they let Chuck Schumer , keeping a remarkably firm grip on vulnerable Senate Democrats who are likely to lose their re-elections in 18 months , drive a bill such as you would have expected when Barack Obama was in the White House and Democrats had a Senate majority .\nUnfortunately , since this bill will have the support of many Democrats , it can ’ t be stopped by a few courageous Republicans standing against it , whether in the House or even with a Senate filibuster . But I ’ d love to see Justin Amash and the entire Freedom Caucus in the House , and Mike Lee and Rand Paul and Ben Sasse and other fiscal conservatives in the Senate give it the old college try . This “ deal ” must not sail through unopposed ( although it ’ s easy to oppose a bill when you know it ’ s got the votes without you ) .\nThe best Republican strategy is to call Chuck “ Fake Tears ” Schumer ’ s bluff and let the Democrats “ shut down ” the government ( which means that much of government keeps operating ) . The fact that they haven ’ t shows that deep down too many Republicans like increasing spending . It ’ s utterly shameful . It also will make tax reform that much more difficult as hypocritical Democrats wail and rend garments over a burgeoning budget deficit .\nMeanwhile , Vice President Mike Pence is spouting “ we could hardly be more pleased ” nonsense , as are some Congressional Republicans and the Speaker ’ s office , trying to put lipstick on this pig . It ’ s one thing to play the happy-political-spin game . It ’ s another thing to do so when you ’ re abandoning any pretense of principle , and maybe the raison d ’ être for your party , while handing the keys to the kingdom to the Senate Minority Leader .\nRepublicans told us repeatedly : “ Give us congressional majorities and the presidency and we ’ ll do our jobs , we promise. ” Instead , this “ conservative ” party , now led by a vaunted great negotiator , gets rolled , yet again , by the oiliest man in politics .

    "364": "All this talk about Trump this , and Trump that , masks a far bigger political controversy . The Republican Party leadership in Washington , D.C. , has fundamentally betrayed its constituents and they are about to learn that they ’ ve been double-crossed — for years .\nEvery Republican candidate ’ s stock speech sounds the same , the thunderous roar about a government out of control , federal spending out of control ( insert charts and graphs and why , if you stack hundred dollar bills , they will reach the edge of the universe ) , federal taxes out of control ( insert comparisons to socialist countries ) , the federal bureaucracy out of control ( insert metaphors about chains , yokes , and the like ) , the family shattered with federal funding of abortion a crime against humanity ( watch for it — there ! The heart-wrenching sob ) , and our military is emasculated .\nTwo more items were added to the menu , courtesy of Obama . Obamacare Will Be Repealed ! and Illegal Immigration Will Not Stand !\nIn 2009 , the Democrats controlled everything , partly due to the Republicans ’ cowardice on Capitol Hill , and in part because of some of the most inept candidates and campaigns America has seen in years . The Obama folks could have played it safe but went for socialist gold , using the power of the legislative and the executive branches ( and later the judiciary , thank you Justice Roberts ) to advance their agenda .\nThat included federal spending on a level unmatched in human history resulting ultimately in a $ 19 trillion in debt we simply can not pay , and with so many tens of trillions of dollars in unfunded liabilities that “ infinity ” is not far behind . One seventh of the economy was confiscated by the federal government with the passage of Obamacare . Our national borders were declared open and discussions over our national sovereignty closed . And to top it off , the Democrats all but declared themselves above the law .\nThe GOP harrumphed that this would not stand , by God ! If only… if only America would vote them into the majority .\nIn 2009 , the Tea Party was born . The Grand Old Party was rejuvenated . Happy days were here again .\nJust one year later , the Republicans captured the House , and with that , the power of the purse . They now had the authority to stop the insane spending on so many obnoxious and wholly unnecessary ventures . They could end Obamacare simply by not funding it .\nInstead , under the “ leadership ” of John Boehner , it did absolutely nothing . Why , if only we had the Senate ! Then we could take on the President !\nSo in 2014 , after spending hundreds of millions of campaign dollars running hundreds of thousands of television and radio ads pledging to end illegal immigration while repealing Obamacare “ root and branch ” ( author : Mitch McConnell ) , they were given control of the Senate .\nAnd within a month McConnell re-authorized both , along with every single other thing Harry Reid and Obama wanted for yet another year .\nBut that ’ s because we can ’ t do what we promised until we have the Presidency ! The excuse was as predictable as summer heat in the Sahara .\nIn January of this year , they formally controlled both houses of Congress and the executive branch . Every single thing they ’ d ever promised was now possible .\nThey now had the power to enact every single spending cut they ’ d ever solemnly pledged . All those wasteful programs designed to fill the liberal sandbox — PBS , NPR , Planned Parenthood , NEH and the rest of the alphabet soup ; all the hundreds of billions of dollars in corporate welfare to multi-billion-dollar corporations ; all of the hundreds of billions of dollars directed toward leftist social engineering — poof ! All of it could come to an end with a stroke of a pen .\nThey now had the power to restore fiscal tax sanity too . Remember the flat tax ? The fair tax ? Slashing the highest corporate taxes in the world ? Giving you a tax break ? All of it could be done with a snap of the fingers .\nRepeal Obamacare ? Check . End illegal immigration ? Check . Build the wall ? Check .\nThere was not a damn thing the Democrats could do to stop them from draining the swamp .\nExcept the Republican leadership didn ’ t mean it . With the exception of the Freedom Caucus in the House , and literally a handful in the Senate , the rank-and-file didn ’ t either . Not one word of it .\nThe opportunity arose for the vote to repeal Obamacare , and after huffing and puffing , and huffing and puffing some more , the dust settled and socialized health care remains the law of the land , perhaps permanently .\nThe opportunity arose for tax reform , to enact the cuts America desperately needs . It was never a matter of if , it was a matter of how much . It is now mid-August and nothing , absolutely nothing has been accomplished — even attempted !\nAnd now we face the final test : the debt ceiling . Will we or won ’ t we stop the spending madness ? Will the Republicans enact the cuts they ’ ve promised , or will they now be the ones to kick the can , piling evermore trillions of dollars of debt on their own grandchildren ?\nBy every indication that ’ s precisely what they plan to do . The signal has come from President Trump , from Speaker Ryan , and from Majority Leader McConnell . The debt ceiling will be raised and no fiscal sanity will be restored .\nThere is no difference between Republicans and Democrats . Put them together . They are the swamp .\nJust as Republicans have the power to enact the agenda they ’ ve pledged in toto , so too do they now own the federal government , in toto . It ’ s no longer Obamacare . It ’ s GOPcare . It ’ s no longer crazy liberal Democratic spending . It ’ s crazy liberal Republican spending . It ’ s no longer socialist Democratic Party taxation , it ’ s socialist Republican Party taxation . All the legislation authorizing all these programs , all the graft , all the waste , all the obscenity , all the immorality , and where Planned Parenthood is concerned , all the killing — all of it is now formally authored by the Republican Party .\nCome the Congressional elections next year , and the presidential election in 2020 , the Grand Old Party will once again bellow its hallowed promises .

    "365": "Enrollment has swelled for Yale University 's introductory art history course , which covers `` the Renaissance to the present . '' That 's because the school plans to eliminate the popular class after the spring .\nAccording to The Yale Daily News , the art department has decided that the class might make some students uncomfortable due to the `` overwhelming '' whiteness , maleness , and straightness of the artists who comprise the Western canon ( though that last label may be dubious ) . Indeed , the focus on Western art is `` problematic , '' course instructor Tim Barringer told the student newspaper .\n`` I want all Yale students ( and all residents of New Haven who can enter our museums freely ) to have access to and to feel confident analyzing and enjoying the core works of the western tradition , '' said Barringer . `` But I do n't mistake a history of European painting for the history of all art in all places . ''\nIn its final iteration , the course will `` consider art in relation to questions of gender , class and race and discuss its involvement with Western capitalism , '' according to the latest syllabus . Art 's relationship to climate change will also be a `` key theme . ''\n`` I 'm really looking forward to seeing what works the students come up with to counteract or undermine my own narratives , '' said Barringer .\nArt students who wish to master the Western canon will still find plenty of other courses that satisfy their interests . But the removal of the introductory course makes it difficult for non-majors with a casual interest in the subject to study it .\n`` My biggest critique of the decision is that it 's a disservice to undergrads , '' one student , Mahlon Sorensen , told The Yale Daily News . `` If you get rid of that one , all-encompassing course , then to understand the Western canon of art , students are going to have to take multiple art history courses . Which is all well and good for the art history major , but it sucks for the rest of us . ''\nIt has become more common in recent years for small cabals of students to rebel against liberal arts curricula that they feel are too focused on Western artists , authors , and thinkers . Students at Reed College , for instance , successfully pressured educators to disband an introductory humanities course . In that case , the activists demanded that all European texts be removed and replaced by non-European books as a form of reparations `` for Humanities 110 's history of erasing the histories of people of color , especially black people . '' Yale 's art department seems to be changing with the times .\nIt 's good to include more perspectives and to ensure that a liberal arts education is not excessively focused on Europe . But diversity by addition is vastly preferable to diversity by subtraction . When a university eliminates an introductory art class because a tiny number of ideologues object to the whiteness and maleness of it all , it feels like they are declining to teach history because some people do n't like what happened .

For the past 13 years , she has taught introductory accounting—a `` dry and difficult subject matter , '' in her words .\nTo make the class more exciting , Lowry has for years let students make funny videos for extra credit . Some of these have been shown in class .

But at least a few were offended and complained to the administration , which subsequently relieved Lowry of her teaching duties .\nThe video in question is in the style of the popular Downfall parodies .

At the same time , she was surprised by the administration 's `` snap judgment '' that she could no longer teach her class :\n`` This was an educational opportunity at a major research university . It 's just unfortunate that the university did not take advantage of this educational opportunity .

    "376": "March 16 ( UPI ) — President Donald Trump on Thursday released a proposed budget that could cut funding to the Environmental Protection Agency by 31 percent and the State Department by 29 percent while boosting military funds .\nStacks of the blueprint — titled “ America First ” — were delivered to the Government Printing Office bookstore and a 62-page document was posted on the White House website early Thursday .\nOffice of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney on Wednesday told reporters the White House proposal will cut the EPA ’ s budget down from $ 8.1 billion to $ 5.7 billion . About 3,200 positions — or more than 20 percent — in the EPA ’ s workforce of 15,000 would be cut .\nThe proposed budget would end funding to former President Barack Obama ’ s Clean Power Plan — his signature effort to combat climate change by regulating power plants ’ carbon dioxide emissions . EPA programs such as the $ 73 million-a-year Chesapeake Bay cleanup project and the Energy Star program , designed to improve energy efficiency and save consumers money , would lose all funding .\n“ You can ’ t drain the swamp and leave all the people in it . So , I guess the first place that comes to mind will be the Environmental Protection Agency , ” Mulvaney told reporters . “ The president wants a smaller EPA . He thinks they overreach , and the budget reflects that . ”\nIn a Gallup poll released Wednesday , 59 percent of Americans said protecting the environment is more important than continuing use of traditional energy , such as fossil fuels . In the poll , 71 percent of people said the United States should focus on alternative energy to solve U.S. energy problems , while 23 percent said the country should emphasize the production of oil , gas and coal .\nThe State Department ’ s core programs face a $ 10 billion cut . The budget proposal would eliminate climate-change initiatives and slash foreign aid funding , United Nations contributions and cultural exchanges . The proposal also calls for cuts to State Department operations in war-torn areas such as Syria , Iraq and Afghanistan .\nOverall , the State Department ’ s budget would shrink from $ 52.8 billion to $ 37.6 billion .\nTrump ’ s proposal would eliminate funding to 19 agencies including the African Development Foundation , the Chemical Safety Board , the National Endowment for the Arts , the U.S. Institute on Peace and the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness .\nThe winners in Trump ’ s proposed budget are the Defense Department which would see a $ 52.3 billion increase , the Department of Veteran ’ s Affairs which would see a $ 4.4 billion increase and the Department of HomelandSsecurity which will see a $ 2.8 billion increase .\n“ There ’ s no question this is a hard-power budget , ” Mulvaney said . “ It is not a soft-power budget . This is a hard-power budget . And that was done intentionally . The president very clearly wants to send a message to our allies and our potential adversaries that this is a strong-power administration . ”\n“ The administration ’ s budget isn ’ t going to be the budget , ” said Sen. Marco Rubio , R-Fla. “ We do the budget here . The administration makes recommendations , but Congress does budgets . ” \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "377": "Anthony Weiner , a man ill-equipped to keep even his most private equipment from public exposure , possessed emails from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on his home computer .\nThe revelation prompted the FBI to announce Friday a reopening of its investigation into the former secretary of state sending and receiving public business on a private server . The FBI remained unaware of these electronic missives when its director recommended not to indict Clinton this summer .\n“ In connection with an unrelated case , the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation , ” FBI Director James Comey wrote Congressional leaders . “ I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information , as well as to assess their importance to our investigation . ”\nComey continued that “ the FBI can not yet assess whether or not this material may be significant ” or contain classified documents . But amateur sleuths without training at Quantico can deduce that if Andrew Breitbart could obtain a picture of the former member of Congress ’ s member originating from one of his digital devices , then surely the Russians , Chinese , North Koreans , or just bored kids in California could easily obtain documents on the computer shared by Weiner ’ s wife Huma Abedin originating from the secretary of state . Like the publication of private emails from Clinton ’ s closest aides through WikiLeaks , the discovery of the former secretary ’ s emails on Anthony Weiner ’ s computer suggests that shielding public business on a private server left State Department less protected than its secretary .\nJoe diGenova , a former U.S. attorney and independent counsel , believes the reopening of the case hurts not just Clinton but Comey .\n“ The stunning revelation in Comey ’ s letter to various Congressional committees today reveals that the Bureau ’ s investigation into Hillary Clinton ’ s use of a private , unsecured , unencrypted server in her home to conduct government business was not thorough , ” diGenova told The ███ on Friday . “ Any rudimentary probe would have required that the devices of a target/subject ’ s husband be seized and examined . The fact that Weiner ’ s devices were not seized shows a level of incompetence by Comey that should lead to his resignation . ”\nComey characterizing a unilateral decision to recommend not indicting Clinton as unanimous within the bureau hurt his standing with the rank-and-file . The decision to come clean with the findings regarding the separate Anthony Weiner investigation on Friday preempts any danger of investigators fed up with their boss ’ s handling of the matter from leaking the findings to the press .\n“ Comey ’ s letter to the Hill was the most embarrassing moment for the Bureau since former director L. Patrick Gray burned Watergate documents in his fireplace , ” diGenova judges . “ Former and current agents remain bereft and view Comey as a ‘ dirty cop. ’ They believe that he threw the original case for political reasons and no longer has the moral authority to lead the world ’ s premier investigative agency . ”\nThe director , in a damned-if-I-do-damned-if-I-don ’ t position this summer in opening up the bureau to charges of politicizing the apolitical FBI whether he recommended an indictment of not , now , less than two weeks before an election , puts himself and the bureau in a far more precarious spot .\n“ Now , because of his cynical use of his power originally to be a ‘ hero ’ he must either end the new probe quickly and be criticized for that or let it [ continue ] beyond the election and be criticized for that , ” diGenova notes . “ It is all a disaster of his own making . ” \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

    "379": "When he was first elected president , many observers , up to and including the Norwegian Nobel Committee , believed Barack Obama would represent a substantive departure from the foreign policy of his predecessor , George W. Bush . On the campaign trail , the then–senator from Illinois promised to bring the Iraq War to an end within 16 months . In reality , it ended in December 2011 , as agreed upon in the status of forces agreement Bush made with Iraq in 2008 , and only after Obama tried and failed to keep a 10,000-strong residual force there past the withdrawal date .\nOn the eve of Election Day 2016 , there were about 5,000 U.S. soldiers in that country . Many were embedded with Iraqi troops or otherwise engaged in the military campaign to retake the city of Mosul from ISIS , a group that evolved out of Al Qaeda in Iraq—itself a product of and one of the primary combatants in the post-invasion phase of the war . The number of Americans in the country has crept upward since June 2014 , when Obama sent troops there at the request of the Iraqi government . The deployment came just two and a half years after the withdrawal that was supposed to mark the conclusion of the war in Iraq .\nCandidate Obama promised a `` robust '' diplomatic effort aimed toward Iraq and its neighbors ( including Syria and Iran ) to ensure the countries ' stability . Instead , the U.S. continues to press for regime change in Syria while keeping diplomatic engagement with Iran limited largely to the status of the latter 's nuclear program . U.S. troops and other American military assets are involved both in the fight against ISIS in Syria and in supporting the rebellion to remove Syrian President Bashar Assad from power .\nThere are troops and other assets in Libya , whose previous government was overthrown during a U.S.-led intervention into the country 's civil war ; in Somalia , where the U.S. has had an on-again , off-again military presence since the collapse of the Siad Barre government in 1993 , and where the U.S. is currently fighting Al-Shabab , an Al Qaeda affiliate ; in Yemen , where the U.S.-and-Saudi-backed government-in-exile is trying to retake control of the country ; in West Africa , where the U.S. is assisting in the fight against Boko Haram , a Nigerian terror group with ties to Al Qaeda and ISIS ; and in Uganda and its neighbors , where the U.S. is assisting in the war with Joseph Kony and his Lord 's Resistance Army .\nAccording to the most recent War Powers report from Obama to Congress , we also have troops deployed in Turkey and Djibouti ( to support efforts in the Middle East ) , Cuba ( Guantanamo Bay remains open nearly eight years after Obama signed an executive order to close it ) , Egypt ( where we 've been since 1981 ) , Kosovo ( where we 've been since 1999 ) , and Jordan ( where 2,200 American troops are assisting the government ) .\nFinally , more than 8,000 U.S. troops remain in Afghanistan . That war , begun in October 2001 as a response to the terrorist attacks of 9/11 , has now lasted longer than the American Civil War and the entirety of World War I and World War II . President Obama has repeatedly postponed the date of withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan ; the final drawdown is currently scheduled for sometime after he leaves office .\nObama promised to take the Afghan war more seriously , but a surge in troops and diplomatic personnel early in his presidency changed little on the ground , and the Afghan government seems no more capable now than it was eight years ago of governing the country without the assistance of foreign military powers . Any opportunity created by the deployments was squandered by bureaucratic infighting , as detailed in Rajiv Chandrasekaran 's 2012 book Little America : The War Within the War for Afghanistan .\nAccording to the committee that awarded him the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize , Obama was being recognized `` for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples . '' At the time , Obama acknowledged that the honor was aspirational . It still is . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

It follows a plan Obama announced last October to tighten security for the debit cards that transmit federal benefits to millions of Americans .\nAfter holding his first meeting of the new year with the top leaders in Congress on Tuesday , Obama will discuss cybersecurity , including ways of getting the private sector and federal government to voluntarily share more cybersecurity information . He 'll do so at the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center , a part of the Department of Homeland Security that shares information among the public and private sectors .\nObama 's focus on cybersecurity follows the recent hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc . The president and other senior administration officials blame North Korea for the crippling attack , which disclosed confidential company emails and business files and included threats of terror attacks against U.S. movie theaters until Sony agreed to cancel the Christmas release of its film `` The Interview . '' The comedy depicts an assassination plot against North Korean leader Kim Jong Un .\nSony eventually released the film online and in a small number of theaters .\nOn Wednesday , Obama will be in Iowa to talk about making affordable , high-speed Internet more available nationwide .\nTraditionally , the White House closely guards the details of plans to be offered in the State of the Union until just before the president delivers the nationally televised address .\nBut in a bid to generate excitement for the speech as he begins the next-to-last year of his presidency , Obama began previewing new initiatives during the week , including programs to boost homeownership by reducing mortgage insurance premiums and increase access to higher education by paying for the first two years of community college for Americans who meet certain criteria .\n`` I did n't want to wait for the State of the Union to talk about all the things that make this country great and how we can make it better , so I thought I 'd get started this week , '' Obama said Wednesday in Michigan , where he discussed a rebounding U.S. auto industry . `` I figured , why wait ?

    "383": "The FBI investigated him under the pretext that his aides included people loyal to the Russian government rather than their own . They used electronic surveillance to spy on him . They pored over salacious material of a sexual nature . The administration that initially authorized the spying denied , denied , denied .\nThe parallels between the peeping-tom state that surveilled Donald Trump in 2016 and Martin Luther King more than a half-century earlier appear uncanny . Those parallels diverge when it comes to the mass media covering the ill-gotten , and surely in some cases false , information .\nThe UK ’ s Guardian commissioned David Garrow , a Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer of Martin Luther King , to write an article detailing his shocking discoveries about the civil rights leader ’ s behind-closed-doors behavior , before pulling out with a kill fee . “ Garrow had similar experiences with the Atlantic magazine and with the Washington Post — both of which he had written for before , ” Michael Mosbacher writes at Standpoint , which publishes the controversial article on Thursday . “ Conservative magazines in the US also felt the story was too risky to run . The same response came from a web magazine whose raison d ’ être is to fight for free speech . When Standpoint decided to publish it , the longest essay we have ever run , I approached a prominent British historian to write an article putting the revelations into context . The response : ‘ No way ! I ’ ll try to think of someone else who has the guts to drink from that particular poisoned chalice . ’ ”\nThe revelations say something unpleasant both about King and the FBI , which bugged hotel rooms where he slept and expected privacy . Surely if a private citizen acted in the way FBI agents did their names would eventually appear on a sex-offender registry . Law enforcement officers listening to what they characterized as a rape without intervening exposes the prurient nature of the investigation . “ Well , the FBI is — from J. Edgar Hoover ( why is his name still on the building ? ) to James Comey — a government unto itself , as we have been constantly reminded of late , ” Roger Simon , a 1960s civil rights activist , writes at PJMedia . “ Let us hope they , and others , get the mammoth house cleaning they deserve . ”\nBut King ’ s antagonists remain mostly anonymous and beyond accountability ; the Baptist minister ’ s deeds appear in publications around the world — but not much in the nation King called home . A Google search shows Garrow ’ s research making headlines in India , the UK , Russia , and points beyond . In the United States , listen to the crickets . This says something about the curiously incurious American media .\nAmerican journalists , who normally salivate over throwing mud on historical figures and find themselves in hysteria mode over the sexual conduct of comedians , producers , anchormen , and those far lower on the totem pole than King , balk at reporting on the finds of a writer to whom they once awarded a Pulitzer . # ThemToo . Apart from King emerging as a secular saint posthumously , making unflattering truths a sort of blasphemy , the allegations put off because they strike as so off putting . Nobody , perhaps least of all Garrow — a member of the Democratic Socialists of America — wants to write something nasty about a man responsible for so much good . The allegations make one feel ill in a literal sense .\n“ The FBI document says : ‘ When one of the women protested that she did not approve , the Baptist minister immediately and forcefully raped her ’ as King watched , ” the Daily Mail reports . “ He is alleged to have ‘ looked on , laughed and offered advice ’ during the encounter . ”\nKing allegedly participated in an orgy along with a dozen others the following day . When one female expressed skittishness , King informed her that participating “ would help your soul . ”\n“ I always thought there were 10-12 other women , ” the London Times quotes Garrow as saying , “ not 40-45. ” He comes to this conclusion after reading FBI summaries of audio surveillance of King . The tapes remain under lock-and-key at the National Archives until 2027 . Raw FBI reports , particularly ones that rely on informants , often relay gossip and rumors and lies told by those looking for some advantage . Because these reports come straight from audio tapes , their level of authenticity , one presumes , likely rises to a higher level than other information gathered by the bureau . Perhaps the summaries exaggerate the bad , and in some cases criminal , behavior on the tapes . But did agents really just make it all up ? Surely , some of the participants still live to refute or corroborate the allegations . Beyond this , a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian so obviously sympathetic to King and his aims vouching for the information grants it credibility . “ It poses so fundamental a challenge to his historical stature , ” Garrow says of what he saw in the archives , “ as to require the most complete and extensive historical review possible . ”\nMartin Luther King may or may not be , as Standpoint editorializes , “ the Harvey Weinstein of the civil rights movement. ” But he ’ s not Donald Trump , which helps explain the journalistic indifference . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

The matter is not his proudest life achievement , and what has transpired offers a potent life lesson for all . From all accounts , Mr. Trump has a very wonderful wife who regularly has stood by him publicly over the years through thick and thin , is profoundly intelligent and exceptionally accomplished both in language mastery and in corporate enterprises , has a pleasant appearance , seems to do well with her stepchildren , and has borne him one of her own , a fine young fellow . To the degree that the matter of the pole dancer with the two implants now has become an obstruction in Mr. Trump ’ s life and yet one more excuse by which cynically dishonest and hypocritical Democrats can try subverting his excellent Presidential agenda , it is a shame . Plenty of shame to go around on this one .\nLet us be clear , though , on what the Left media do not report or explain . By all accounts , Donald J. Trump , notwithstanding his eccentricities and thin skin when attacked even by utter nonentities beneath his station , took a turn in his life as he got serious about running for President . He found , perhaps to his surprise , that his strongest support comes from Christians , devout Catholics , and Orthodox Jews , that his conservative policy positions and traditional legislative goals indeed resonate with the religious . He has connected with serious Christian pastors , and he has been warmly received by mainstream normative Orthodox rabbis . In time , he has come to address Liberty College , still finding his footing when quoting the Bible ( “ Two Corinthians ” versus “ Second Corinthians ” ) , has become a great defender of prayer and freedom of the pulpit , and a defender of religious freedom in general .\nBy all accounts , the matter surrounding the pole dancer and the implants is not comparable on any level to what Americans have had to experience with comparatively recent Presidential candidates like Gary Hart , Ted Kennedy , and John Edwards , or President Bill Clinton who actually have used Presidential runs , or their possibilities , or the ascent to such office as leverage to get playmates when the wife is not watching .\nLeaving aside Clinton ’ s Arkansas-days shenanigans with Gennifer Flowers , Paula Jones , and the rape of Juanita Broaddrick , he later abused and harassed Kathleen Willey when he became President . And two other words need no elaboration , not even an inserted hyperlink to Wikipedia : “ Monica Lewinsky. ” For Gary Hart — Donna Rice . For John Edwards — Rielle Hunter nee Lisa Jo Druck and baby . For Ted Kennedy — Chappaquiddick . By contrast , from the moment he began running for Presidential office , Donald Trump has had one woman in his life , Melania . On this issue of personal character , he clearly got responsible and became serious .\nYes , there have been the tweets and the maddening verbal broadsides — insults back and forth , whether with one or another accuser from the past , a painfully shameful audio recording in a trailer , and the like . The American people weighed so much of that amply reported information when they cast their votes in November 2016 for their President . They had an alternative , Hillary Clinton , and they elected Trump . Indeed , so many more Caucasian women voted for Trump than for Hillary that her surrogates and she have spent the past two years denigrating them . As she put it : “ I ’ m talking principally about white women — they [ were ] under tremendous pressure from fathers and husbands and boyfriends . ”\nHush Money for Peccadilloes Simply Is Not a Campaign Finance Matter\nThe payment of “ hush money ” to shut a woman up is sordid . The very need for “ hush money ” implies a predicate sordid deed . For those among the electorate who do not know millionaires and billionaires , “ hush money ” seems foreign indeed . It costs a bunch of cash to buy someone ’ s silence . But among those who are perhaps too rich for their own good , it is part of the cost of their doing business in circles where they believe themselves above all others , invincible , invulnerable , and beyond reproach .\nThe New York Times reported that actress and director Asia Argento , fittingly a leading voice in the # MeToo movement , is accused of paying $ 380,000 hush money to one Jimmy Bennett , who claims she sexually assaulted him in a hotel room when he was 17 . That buys a lot of hush . The Chicago Tribune describes a Congressional Hush Money Fund to protect our paid legislators — your tax dollars at work . At least $ 17 million was spent to shut the mouths of those whose mouths politically needed to be shut . Rep. John Conyers paid hush money from a separate fund to keep his lady friends immersed in hush . CBS paid more than $ 5 million in hush money over twenty years to a woman who accused 60 Minutes producer Don Hewitt ( pronounced : You it ! ) . Charlie Sheen , the former NBC star , paid millions in hush money after engaging in more peccadilloes than , say , two and a half men . MSNBC paid hush money to protect Hardball Chris Matthews when , on an occasion separate from the time a thrill ran up his leg , he was accused . MSNBC also issued a formal reprimand . Fox News paid hush money for years to people who proffered allegations against Bill O ’ Reilly .\nThe payment of hush money by celebrities , sports stars , and multi-millionaires and billionaires has nothing to do with election campaign donations . It is about keeping secrets from a wife or husband who otherwise would walk out of a marriage if he or she found out . Or it aims to keep the publicity away from the children because the kinds of people who have the wherewithal to pay hush money for peccadilloes are the kinds whose scandals will hit the media circuit . Celebrities in more wholesome American times did not want the public to know they cavorted disgracefully because they feared losing their movie followings and careers . A Los Angeles Laker basketball player had to buy his wife a rare $ 4 million eight-carat purple-diamond ring after news emerged that he had cheated on her in an Edwards , Colorado hotel room ; a few years after the ring lost its glitter , she filed for divorce anyway . Donald Sterling , another Los Angeles basketball legend , gave one of his girlfriends $ 500,000 in luxury cars and a $ 1.8 million home ; when his wife found out , she sued to regain her half of it in community-property California . The Rev . Jesse Jackson ’ s Operation PUSH/Rainbow Coalition paid money to Karin Stanford after she had his baby ; payments included $ 15,000 to move and $ 21,000 for consulting services , but they rescinded another promised $ 40,000 in contracting work when the affair became known .\nIt is beyond absurd to suggest that any hush money paid to the pole dancer with the implants by Michael Cohen , Trump ’ s former attorney from his pre-Presidential years , was intended as a campaign expenditure . It plainly was to guard Trump ’ s innocent wife from embarrassment , protect his marriage , spare his children from seeing a sordid report in the news about a side of their Dad that they already had to know or suspect . Alas , in the heightened cynical age in which this unfolds , Democrats are primed to leverage their new House majority to search for impeachable offenses in all this . It is that absurd .\nWho Will Call the Democrats Bluff and Dare Them Finally to Put Up or Hush Up on Impeachment ?\nAt some point , sooner or later , perhaps Trump supporters will come to root for impeachment proceedings finally to begin . Impeach 45 ? Bring it on !\nImpeachments of American presidents never really are about high crimes or misdemeanors . ( U.S. Const . Art . II , § 4 . ) Rather , they are political theater . When the Republican Abraham Lincoln was murdered after emancipating African American slaves , he was succeeded by Democrat Andrew Johnson , the Southerner from eastern Tennessee whom Lincoln had named as his running mate to balance his ticket . The northern Republicans who dominated the Congress as the Civil War ended were determined to remove Johnson , and they easily had the votes in the House to impeach . They needed two-thirds in the Senate to convict , and they fell one vote short ( 35-19 ) when Edmund G. Ross of Kansas voted his conscience , as did nine other Republicans . President Johnson had fired his Secretary of War , Edwin McMasters Stanton , and subsequent legislation and United States Supreme Court jurisprudence strongly tend to uphold a President ’ s authority to remove cabinet officials and others without Congressional approval . See , e.g. , Myers v. United States , 272 U.S. 52 ( 1926 ) . A similar impeachment effort against President Clinton in December 1998 , again politically motivated and somewhat botched , generated mixed political results . His name was sullied and his reputation , like Ms. Lewinsky ’ s dress , was stained , but he emerged politically whole and a prized Democrat star for another two decades even though he never received 50 percent of the vote in either of his two Presidential races . On the other hand , the Clinton scandals may have helped elect George W. Bush President in 2000 , as Al Gore avoided having Clinton help campaign for him , and Bush was seen as more morally fit to lead the nation .\nIf the Democrats ever truly proceed with bills of impeachment aimed at President Trump , whether based on hush money payments that predate Mr. Trump ’ s presidency or on his pre-Presidential entrepreneurial interest in building a Trump hotel in Moscow or on his proper wielding of his executive authority to fire James Comey , a leaking political partisan who really needed to be removed from a compromised Federal Bureau of Investigation , they presumably will have the votes to send the allegations to the Senate . We know from the impeachments of Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton that it does not matter a whit whether it is a high crime or misdemeanor for a President to fire a Secretary of War or to lie about his secret rendezvous with a woman about whom his wife is not supposed to know . Rather , Presidential impeachment is pure Swamp Politics , bought and paid for with our tax dollars . The United States Senate never will come even close to mustering the required two-thirds vote to convict President Trump for any actions pre-dating his election , and they probably would not dare convict for anything he has done or will do since his election either , unless it truly and unequivocally constitutes a bona fide high crime or misdemeanor .\nNot one single Democrat Senator voted to convict President Clinton , and no Republican Senator will vote to convict Mr. Trump . The two Republican Senate “ Never Trumpers ” — Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Flake of Arizona — will be long gone , and any Republican Senator who would vote for conviction would follow . The more radical Democrats — Spartacus , Bernie , Pocahontas , and Company — would play politics for their bases and vote to convict . However , other Senate Democrats like Doug Jones of Alabama , who faces a brutal reelection campaign in 2020 when Mr. Trump will be heading the national Republican ticket and Roy Moore will not be the Republicans ’ Alabama Senate nominee , probably will vote with the Republicans and for Mr. Trump in the same way that Joe Manchin saw the light momentarily and broke Democrat ranks to hold his West Virginia Senate seat by voting to confirm the Hon . Brett M. Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court . In the end , suburban Caucasian swing voters will be left wondering why they gave the Democrats the House in 2018 , only to see promises about focusing on fixing health care and immigration get diverted so that the Democrats ’ increasingly radical Left base could realize their pointless and ultimately fizzled impeachment aspirations .\nPerhaps the better hush money will be allocated to silencing those bombastic Democrats endlessly trying to find in every day ’ s news an excuse to threaten impeachment . In time , the inevitable House Speaker Nancy Pelosi may well be cooing behind closed doors to her sister California House Democrat , paraphrasing the title of a film about two insane women : Hush , hush , sweet Maxine . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "387": "Opponents of same-sex marriage are scrambling to find effective responses , in Congress and state legislatures , to a rash of court rulings that would force some of America 's most conservative states to accept gay nuptials .\nSome gay-marriage foes are backing a bill recently introduced in both chambers of Congress that would leave states fully in charge of their marriage policies , though the measure stands little chance of passage . In the states , they are endorsing a multitude of bills — some intended to protect gay-marriage bans , others to assert a right , based on religious freedom , to have nothing to do with gay marriages should those bans be struck down .\nIn Utah , Oklahoma , Kentucky and Virginia , federal judges have voided part or all of the bans on same-sex marriage that voters approved between 2004 and 2006 . Each of the rulings has been stayed pending appeals , and a final nationwide resolution may be a few years away in the U.S. Supreme Court .\nThe trend is unsettling to the activists who oppose gay marriage , and some have called for extraordinary measures in response .\nAlabama Chief Justice Roy Moore , known for fighting to display the Ten Commandments in a judicial building , has written to all 50 governors urging them to support a federal constitutional amendment defining marriage as between only a man and a woman .\nIn Missouri , where voters approved a gay-marriage ban in 2004 , eight Republican House members filed articles of impeachment against Democratic Gov . Jay Nixon after he ordered his administration to accept joint tax returns from same-sex couples who were legally married in other states . The Republican House leader has yet to schedule the matter for public hearings , but some GOP sponsors insist they are serious .\n`` The people put it in the constitution that marriage is between one man and one woman — the issue is the governor has absolutely ignored the constitution and the people 's will , '' said Rep. Ron Schieber , a Republican from Kansas City .\nThe demand for religious exemptions , meanwhile , is widespread . Gay marriage opponents have fought for strong exemptions in every state where lawmakers have already decided the issue . In New York , for example , gay marriage was recognized only after Gov . Andrew Cuomo and the state 's top two legislators struck an 11th-hour compromise on religious accommodations .\nHowever , the resulting exemptions have generally been limited in scope — and have n't come anywhere near to what gay marriage opponents sought . In Massachusetts and Iowa , where same-sex marriage won recognition through the courts , there are no religious exemptions related to the rulings .\nIn light of this track record , opponents in red states have been proposing pre-emptive bills with broad accommodations for religious objectors . Most of the bills aim to protect individuals or businesses who , for religious reasons , do n't want to serve same-sex couples .\nBills in Ohio , Mississippi , Arizona , Idaho and Oklahoma would allow a person or company to assert a religious freedom defense against a lawsuit from another private party . For example , a baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a gay couple could defend his decision as a legally protected religious right .\nThe Kansas House passed a measure last week providing a faith-based legal shield for people who refuse to provide services to gays and lesbians . It details which services would be exempted — ranging from bakeries to adoption agencies to government clerks — and allows faith-based refusal of services to gay couples in any domestic partnership . But the top Republican in the state Senate put a quick stop to the bill 's momentum , declaring that a majority of GOP lawmakers in that chamber do n't support it .\n`` A strong majority of my members support laws that define traditional marriage , '' said Senate President Susan Wagle . `` However , my members also do n't condone discrimination . ''\nIn South Dakota , a Republican-led Senate committee narrowly defeated a similar bill that would have barred lawsuits or criminal charges against clergy who refuse to perform same-sex weddings . Critics of the bill said it was unnecessary because the U.S. Constitution already guarantees religious freedom .\nOne of the sponsors of that measure was Rep. Steve Hickey , pastor of a Sioux Falls church that opposes gay marriage .\n`` I 'm saying keep the state out of my church , '' Hickey said at a committee hearing . `` I only promote and perform traditional marriages . ... It 's is not because there is any bigotry . It 's because I deeply care about people . ''\nIn Indiana , the battle over gay marriage has revealed rifts among Republicans . GOP Gov . Mike Pence urged lawmakers to refer a constitutional ban on gay marriage to the November ballot , but the measure suffered a significant setback last week that could delay a vote until 2016 .\nProposed constitutional amendments must be approved twice by the Indiana Legislature — unchanged and in consecutive biennial sessions — before making the ballot . The proposed gay-marriage ban cleared the Republican-led Legislature two years ago but was changed recently to remove a ban on civil unions , thus preventing it from going to the 2014 ballot .\nPeter Sprigg , a senior fellow with the conservative Family Research Council , expressed disappointment with the Indiana development .\n`` That was our best hope for a victory at the ballot box this year , '' he said .\nOverall , Sprigg said he remained hopeful that the U.S. Supreme Court — if it takes up appeals of any of the recent federal court cases — would not rush to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide .\nLast June , the high court did order the federal government to recognize valid same-sex marriages , which are allowed in 17 states and the District of Columbia . But the court declined to go further and require all states to allow them .\nJohn Eastman , an opponent of same-sex marriage who chairs the National Organization for Marriage , said he and his allies were battling to challenge a growing perception that nationwide gay marriage is inevitable . In particular , he derided Republican political consultants who were advising the party — which officially opposes same-sex marriage — to tone its rhetoric on the issue .\n`` The consultant class of the GOP has been stupid , '' Eastman said .\nEastman 's organization has praised a bill recently introduced in Congress by conservative Republicans titled the State Marriage Defense Act . It would require the federal government to respect state determinations of the marital status of their residents when applying federal law .\nHowever , the bill is considered to have no chance of passage in the Democratic-led Senate , and its prospects in the GOP-controlled House are uncertain .\n`` The bill is so tortured by hypocrisy that it falls of its own weight , '' said Fred Sainz of the Human Rights Campaign , a national gay-rights group . He noted that only a few years ago , many social conservatives sought a federal amendment that would ban gay marriage nationwide , overriding the wishes of the states that had legalized it .\nBut opponents of same-sex marriage insist on the right to take their cause to the statehouses .\n`` We support the right of people in the country to disagree on the policy of marriage , '' said Jim Campbell of the conservative legal group Alliance Defending Freedom . `` We as a people , state by state , need to decide what the future of marriage is going to be .

    "388": "NEW YORK — John Podesta , Hillary Clinton ’ s top political adviser who served as chairman of her presidential campaign , expressed his support for a request by ten Electoral College voters to receive an intelligence briefing on claims of foreign intervention in the presidential election .\nPodesta ’ s statements seem to call into question the legitimacy of President-elect Donald Trump ’ s victory .\n“ The bipartisan electors ’ letter raises very grave issues involving our national security , ” Podesta said in a statement Monday , Politico reported . “ Electors have a solemn responsibility under the Constitution and we support their efforts to have their questions addressed . ”\n“ Each day that month , our campaign decried the interference of Russia in our campaign and its evident goal of hurting our campaign to aid Donald Trump , ” he said . “ Despite our protestations , this matter did not receive the attention it deserved by the media in the campaign . We now know that the CIA has determined Russia ’ s interference in our elections was for the purpose of electing Donald Trump . This should distress every American. ” Podesta was responding to an open letter from ten electors – including Nancy Pelosi ’ s daughter , Christine Pelosi , requesting the intelligence briefing . The electors wrote The Electors require to know from the intelligence community whether there are ongoing investigations into ties between Donald Trump , his campaign or associates , and Russian government interference in the election , the scope of those investigations , how far those investigations may have reached , and who was involved in those investigations . We further require a briefing on all investigative findings , as these matters directly impact the core factors in our deliberations of whether Mr. Trump is fit to serve as President of the United States . Podesta ’ s statements are already strengthening attempts by Democratic lawmakers to impact the Electoral College vote on Dec.19 . Politico reported : Shortly after Podesta ’ s statement , the Democratic National Committee disseminated a POLITICO story that revealed the electors ’ call for a briefing . Two Democratic members of Congress have also suggested the Electoral College should take an active role in reassessing — or stopping — a Trump presidency .\nOver the weekend , a Democratic congressman asserted that members of the Electoral College should have the right to consider the alleged impact of Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election when they cast their votes .\n“ To the extent that foreign interference in the United States presidential elections may have influenced the final result , I believe the electors have the right to consider that , ” Rep. David Cicilline ( D-R.I. ) told POLITICO in a statement on Saturday .\nCicilline appears to be the first member of Congress and the highest-ranking elected official in the country to endorse the notion that electors aren ’ t simply rubber stamps for their states ’ popular vote . Earlier Saturday , he retweeted a Rhode Island-based national security expert who argued that the intelligence community “ must brief electoral college about Russia before vote . ”\nCicilline was referring to reports in the Washington Post and New York Times claiming Moscow interfered in the presidential election to help Donald Trump win — a contention the President-elect called “ ridiculous ” in an interview on Sunday .\nCicilline ’ s comments come after a Democratic presidential elector from California filed a lawsuit aiming to overturn a California statute that requires him and the states ’ other electors to support the winner of the popular vote in the state with the aim of voting for someone else . The lawsuit , the second of its kind nationwide , is clearly part of an effort to set a legal precedent to free any rogue Republican electors in other states to cast their ballots for someone other than Trump .\nThe lawsuits join a larger effort to try to turn electors against voting for Trump . Last week , ███ reported Harvard law professor and progressive activist Larry Lessig announced that he is teaming up with a California-based law firm to offer “ free and confidential ” legal services to any members of the Electoral College who will vote against President-elect Donald Trump in violation of state law .\nLessig , a one-time presidential candidate , has served on the boards of numerous groups financed by billionaire George Soros .\nLessig ’ s Electoral College scheme , which is being called the Electors Trust , is a last-ditch effort to stop Trump from becoming president .\nIt comes after a petition drive by the Soros-funded MoveOn.org activist organization sought to abolish the Electoral College altogether .\nLessig ’ s project also follows the largely failed recount efforts of Green Party candidate Jill Stein , who was aided by Hillary Clinton ’ s campaign . ███ reported that the lawyer representing Clinton ’ s recount efforts , Marc Elias , recently led legal battles against state voting laws with an infusion of funding from Soros .\nLessig ’ s effort to help electors vote against Trump was first reported on Monday by Politico :\nLessig says his new effort , which he calls “ The Electors Trust , ” will provide free counsel to electors , provided by the midsize firm , Durie Tangri , whose partner Mark Lemley is a longtime associate of Lessig ’ s . More significantly , Lessig said , the Trust will offer a platform – with guaranteed anonymity – for electors to strategize about stopping Trump from taking the White House . It ’ s a platform , he said , that could help electors coordinate to determine whether they ’ ve gathered enough support to stop Trump from winning the presidency . “ It makes no sense to be elector number five who comes out against Trump . But it might make sense to be elector 38 , ” Lessig said in a phone interview .\nWith their permission , the electors can allow others to know that they are considering a vote of conscience . But that information will not include either their identity or their state . Our primary objective is to provide a safe and confidential legal context in which electors can seek advice and support , and depending on the facts , an opportunity to litigate to defend their freedom .\nReached for comment , Lessig last week refused to provide ███ with the specific numbers of electors who are allegedly considering switching their votes from Trump .\n“ ” I ’ m not in the information flow for that . We ’ re being very careful to assure anonymity , ” Lessig said .\nPolitico reported advocates of the bid to turn the votes of electors against Trump have briefed allies close to Hillary Clinton .\nClinton ’ s team and the Democratic National Committee have steadfastly refused to endorse the efforts spearheaded by a group of electors in Colorado and Washington state . But , as with the ongoing recounts initiated by Green Party nominee Jill Stein , the Clinton team has not categorically rejected them , leaving the collection of mainly Democratic electors to push forward with no explicit public support from the failed Democratic nominee or any other prominent party leaders .\nLessig launched his project after one Republican elector , Chris Suprun of Texas , published a news-making op-ed in the New York Times announcing his intentions not to vote for Trump when the Electoral College meets on Dec. 19 to formally elect the president .\nLessig ’ s movement seems to be gaining some momentum , even if it is a long shot . On Tuesday , the New York Times published an opinion piece by Elizabeth Williamson citing Republican insiders saying there are other quiet “ faithless electors ” like Suprun plotting to vote against Trump . Still , Williamson , a Times editorial writer who specializes in national politics , admitted the chances of the effort succeeding amount to a “ moon shot . ”\nWashington Post columnist Kathleen Parker also advocated for the scheme in a piece titled , “ The electoral college should be unfaithful . ”\nParker claimed renegade electors would write a new history of “ heroism ” :\nElectors are scheduled to meet Dec. 19 in their respective states to cast their final ballots . If there are 37 Republicans among them with the courage to perform their moral duty and protect the nation from a talented but dangerous president-elect , a new history of heroism will have to be written .\nLessig has been a national leader in the movement for so-called net neutrality , a concept highlighted in its infancy in his 1999 book , Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace .\nA study by the Media Research Center found that Soros ’ s foundations and the Ford Foundation donated a combined total of $ 196 million to groups supporting “ net neutrality . ”\nLessig served on the boards of numerous nonprofits advocating so-called net neutrality , including Public Knowledge , Free Press and the Sunlight Foundation . Lessig is still on Sunlight ’ s board .\nAll three are funded by Soros , as documented here , here , here , and here .\nAsked about his associations with those groups , Lessig told ███ , “ I ’ ve served on the board of Public Knowledge , the advisory board of Sunlight , and I ’ ve been a fan of Free Fress . I ’ ve received no compensation from any of them , ever . ”\nAsked whether he served on the board of Free Press , where he was listed on the board , he subsequently replied that he did , from 2007-2009 .\nDespite its namesake , Free Press is a well-known advocate for government intervention in the Internet and news media .\nLessig has been a close associate of Free Press founder Robert W. McChesney , a communications professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who has called for the U.S. capitalist system to be dismantled and replaced with a socialist-style system .\n“ In the end , there is no real answer but to remove brick by brick the capitalist system itself , rebuilding the entire society on socialist principles , ” McChesney wrote in a 2009 essay .\nLessig and McChesney have worked on projects together and have co-authored academic papers and opinion pieces in major newspapers .\nThis reporter previously documented Free Press has advocated for the development of a “ world class ” government-run media system in the U.S .\n“ The need has never been greater for a world-class public media system in America , ” begins a 48-page Free Press policy paper titled , “ New Public Media : A Plan for Action . ”\n“ Commercial media ’ s economic tailspin has pushed public media to the center of the debate over the future of journalism and the media , presenting the greatest opportunity yet to reinvigorate and re-envision the modern U.S. public media system , ” argued the Free Press document .\nThe Free Press study urges the creation of a trust fund – largely supported by new fees and taxes on advertising and the private media – to jump start the founding of a massive government-run public media system that will ultimately become self-sufficient .\n“ We believe local news reporting should become one of public media ’ s top priorities , ” said Free Press Managing Director Craig Aaron , one of the paper ’ s co-authors .\n“ We should redeploy and redouble our resources to keep a watchful eye on the powerful and to reliably examine the vital issues that most Americans can ’ t follow closely on their own , ” Aaron stated .\nAaron Klein is Breitbart ’ s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter .

    "389": "The FBI is operating a small air force with scores of low-flying planes across the country carrying video and , at times , cellphone surveillance technology - all hidden behind fictitious companies that are fronts for the government , The Associated Press has learned .\nThe planes ' surveillance equipment is generally used without a judge 's approval , and the FBI said the flights are used for specific , ongoing investigations . In a recent 30-day period , the agency flew above more than 30 cities in 11 states across the country , an AP review found .\nAerial surveillance represents a changing frontier for law enforcement , providing what the government maintains is an important tool in criminal , terrorism or intelligence probes . But the program raises questions about whether there should be updated policies protecting civil liberties as new technologies pose intrusive opportunities for government spying .\nU.S. law enforcement officials confirmed for the first time the wide-scale use of the aircraft , which the AP traced to at least 13 fake companies , such as FVX Research , KQM Aviation , NBR Aviation and PXW Services . Even basic aspects of the program are withheld from the public in censored versions of official reports from the Justice Department 's inspector general .\n`` The FBI 's aviation program is not secret , '' spokesman Christopher Allen said in a statement . `` Specific aircraft and their capabilities are protected for operational security purposes . '' Allen added that the FBI 's planes `` are not equipped , designed or used for bulk collection activities or mass surveillance . ''\nBut the planes can capture video of unrelated criminal activity on the ground that could be handed over for prosecutions .\nSome of the aircraft can also be equipped with technology that can identify thousands of people below through the cellphones they carry , even if they 're not making a call or in public . Officials said that practice , which mimics cell towers and gets phones to reveal basic subscriber information , is rare .\nDetails confirmed by the FBI track closely with published reports since at least 2003 that a government surveillance program might be behind suspicious-looking planes slowly circling neighborhoods . The AP traced at least 50 aircraft back to the FBI , and identified more than 100 flights since late April orbiting both major cities and rural areas .\nOne of the planes , photographed in flight last week by the AP in northern Virginia , bristled with unusual antennas under its fuselage and a camera on its left side . A federal budget document from 2010 mentioned at least 115 planes , including 90 Cessna aircraft , in the FBI 's surveillance fleet .\nThe FBI also occasionally helps local police with aerial support , such as during the recent disturbance in Baltimore that followed the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray , who sustained grievous injuries while in police custody . Those types of requests are reviewed by senior FBI officials .\nThe surveillance flights comply with agency rules , an FBI spokesman said . Those rules , which are heavily redacted in publicly available documents , limit the types of equipment the agency can use , as well as the justifications and duration of the surveillance .\nDetails about the flights come as the Justice Department seeks to navigate privacy concerns arising from aerial surveillance by unmanned aircrafts , or drones . President Barack Obama has said he welcomes a debate on government surveillance , and has called for more transparency about spying in the wake of disclosures about classified programs .\n`` These are not your grandparents ' surveillance aircraft , '' said Jay Stanley , a senior policy analyst with the American Civil Liberties Union , calling the flights significant `` if the federal government is maintaining a fleet of aircraft whose purpose is to circle over American cities , especially with the technology we know can be attached to those aircraft . ''\nDuring the past few weeks , the AP tracked planes from the FBI 's fleet on more than 100 flights over at least 11 states plus the District of Columbia , most with Cessna 182T Skylane aircraft . These included parts of Houston , Phoenix , Seattle , Chicago , Boston , Minneapolis and Southern California .\nEvolving technology can record higher-quality video from long distances , even at night , and can capture certain identifying information from cellphones using a device known as a `` cell-site simulator '' - or Stingray , to use one of the product 's brand names . These can trick pinpointed cellphones into revealing identification numbers of subscribers , including those not suspected of a crime .\nOfficials say cellphone surveillance is rare , although the AP found in recent weeks FBI flights orbiting large , enclosed buildings for extended periods where aerial photography would be less effective than electronic signals collection . Those included above Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and the Mall of America in Bloomington , Minnesota .\nAfter The Washington Post revealed flights by two planes circling over Baltimore in early May , the AP began analyzing detailed flight data and aircraft-ownership registrations that shared similar addresses and flight patterns . That review found some FBI missions circled above at least 40,000 residents during a single flight over Anaheim , California , in late May , according to Census data and records provided by the website FlightRadar24.com .\nMost flight patterns occurred in counter-clockwise orbits up to several miles wide and roughly one mile above the ground at slow speeds .

The AP analyzed similar data since early May , while also drawing upon aircraft registration documents , business records and interviews with U.S. officials to understand the scope of the operations .\nThe FBI asked the AP not to disclose the names of the fake companies it uncovered , saying that would saddle taxpayers with the expense of creating new cover companies to shield the government 's involvement , and could endanger the planes and integrity of the surveillance missions . The AP declined the FBI 's request because the companies ' names - as well as common addresses linked to the Justice Department - are listed on public documents and in government databases .\nAt least 13 front companies that AP identified being actively used by the FBI are registered to post office boxes in Bristow , Virginia , which is near a regional airport used for private and charter flights . Only one of them appears in state business records .\nIncluded on most aircraft registrations is a mysterious name , Robert Lindley . He is listed as chief executive and has at least three distinct signatures among the companies . Two documents include a signature for Robert Taylor , which is strikingly similar to one of Lindley 's three handwriting patterns .\nThe FBI would not say whether Lindley is a U.S. government employee . The AP unsuccessfully tried to reach Lindley at phone numbers registered to people of the same name in the Washington area since Monday .\nLaw enforcement officials said Justice Department lawyers approved the decision to create fictitious companies to protect the flights ' operational security and that the Federal Aviation Administration was aware of the practice . One of the Lindley-headed companies shares a post office box openly used by the Justice Department .\nSuch elusive practices have endured for decades .

The Obama administration had until recently been directing local authorities through secret agreements not to reveal their own use of the devices , even encouraging prosecutors to drop cases rather than disclose the technology 's use in open court .\nA Justice Department memo last month also expressly barred its component law enforcement agencies from using unmanned drones `` solely for the purpose of monitoring activities protected by the First Amendment '' and said they are to be used only in connection with authorized investigations and activities . A department spokeswoman said the policy applied only to unmanned aircraft systems rather than piloted airplanes . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "390": "The House leadership has started debating Thursday on a border security bill to address the immigration crisis , but conservatives , led by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz , say they may refuse to sign-on without language that would put an end to what they call the `` Obama amnesty '' law.Cruz convened a meeting Wednesday night with 11 rank-and-file House members to try to persuade them to vote against House Speaker John Boehner 's version of the bill on the basis that the measure does not defund President Barack Obama 's Deferred Action for Child Arrivals [ DACA ] executive order.The current leadership bill leaves DACA intact but simply prohibits any official policies to expand its scope , a position conservatives say is not acceptable.Speaker John Boehner gave indications he might give Cruz a concession by adding a vote on a second bill on Thursday . `` I have been speaking with members in both houses who have an interest in my views , '' Cruz told Reuters late on Wednesday.The second bill would stop Obama from expanding his 2012 action to suspend deportations of children brought by their parents to the United States before mid-2007.After the meeting with Cruz , Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann suggested she and other conservatives may withhold their support from the current version of the $ 659 million border bill without stronger language on DACA , Politico reported.Their refusal to sign-on could jeopardize the chances of the bill 's passage , though a number of Democrats have said they would support the bill , according to Politico . `` There is support for the DACA fix , '' Bachmann told Politico . `` I think you will see the DACA-fix bill pass . `` Iowa Rep. Steve King , Texas Rep Louie Gohmert , and Arizona Rep. Matt Salmon were also among those at the meeting.Cruz believes that 2012 DACA law , which allows the president to issue work permits to people in the country illegally , is `` the direct and proximate cause '' of the current crisis , and argues that any House bill should prevent the future implementation of DACA , according to Breitbart `` The only way to stop the border crisis is to stop Obama 's amnesty . It is disappointing the border security legislation unveiled today does not include language to end Obama 's amnesty , '' Cruz said Tuesday . `` Congress can not hope to solve this problem without addressing the fundamental cause of it . `` In an interview Wednesday on Fox News ' `` On the Record with Greta Van Susteren , '' Cruz went a step further saying , `` If you 're granting amnesty to people who come as kids , other kids will come . `` Even with the new DACA strategy put into the legislation , some conservatives Wednesday still were n't satisfied , according to Politico . Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks said the measures still don ’ t provide adequate border security , and Iowa Rep. King wants tougher asylum language.The leadership 's ability to seal a deal is now down to the wire , as the House adjourns Friday for a five-week recess.Meanwhile , Cruz said he has introduced a two-page bill in the Senate that says the president does not have authority to grant amnesty to any new illegal immigrants . `` We should have done our basic job a long time ago , '' he said.Meanwhile , in order for Boehner 's bill to pass without full support of all Republicans , Democrats would have to vote for the measure . That seemed iffy , with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi saying the GOP would be on its own.Pelosi said Democrats were n't necessarily on board . according to The Hill . `` Let me put it this way : The Democrats are not going to enable that bill to pass . That 's the number that we 're interested in , '' Pelosi said . `` They [ Republicans ] are going to have to do that on their own .

    "391": "TEL AVIV – The pro-Palestinian lobby group J Street stated that it was “ proud ” of its role in pushing the controversial Iran nuclear agreement amid reports that it received $ 576,500 to promote the deal from a group tied to White House efforts to sell the agreement to the public .\n“ J Street worked to advance the nuclear agreement with Iran out of the belief that this is an important agreement which contributes mightily to Israel ’ s security , ” J Street said , without denying that it received the funds .\n“ This is a belief that is shared with many officials in both the Obama administration as well as the Israeli defense establishment and among many in the American Jewish community , most of which supports the agreement , ” the organization said .\n“ The nuclear agreement with Iran blocked Iran ’ s pathways to a nuclear weapon for years to come , ” J Street added . “ As of now , Iran has abided by the terms of the deal . ”\nJ Street ’ s financing to advocate for the deal came from the Ploughshares Fund , a group that advocates a nuclear-free world and was identified earlier this month by the White House as central in helping to market the Iran nuclear deal to the news media .\nOn Friday , the Associated Press reported that Ploughshares has also funded National Public Radio since 2005 , and has provided financing to U.S.-based foreign policy think tanks .\nUnmentioned by the AP is that the Ploughshares Fund is financed by billionaire George Soros ’ Open Society Institute . Soros is also a top donor to J Street .\nThe Jerusalem Post summarized the extent of the Ploughshares funding to J Street , reportedly to lobby for the deal within the pro-Israel community .\nJ Street was the single largest beneficiary last year of the Ploughshares Fund , a group that seeks to eliminate the world ’ s nuclear stockpiles , with over $ 575,000 in grants that funded advocacy for the Iran nuclear deal . Ploughshares ’ annual report , first reported last week by the Associated Press , emphasizes the foundation ’ s role in helping to bring about support for sanctions relief for the nuclear rollback deal last year . … The amount of funding for J Street underscores the significance deal proponents attached to garnering American Jewish support for the deal . J Street and J Street Education Fund received a total of $ 576,500 , making it by far the largest recipient of funds . One goal of the funding was “ to mobilize Jewish support for a final deal . ”\nThe involvement of Ploughshares in selling the Iran agreement to the public was revealed in an extensive New York Times Magazine profile of Obama ’ s Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes titled , “ The Aspiring Novelist Who Became Obama ’ s Foreign-Policy Guru. ” The article contains interviews with Rhodes and scores of top Obama administration officials .\nRobert Malley , senior director at the National Security Council , explained the genesis and execution of the marketing plan to sell the Iran deal .\nMalley said “ experts ” were utilized to create an “ echo chamber ” that disseminated administration claims about Iran to “ hundreds of often-clueless reporters ” in the news media .\nIn the spring of last year , legions of arms-control experts began popping up at think tanks and on social media , and then became key sources for hundreds of often-clueless reporters . “ We created an echo chamber , ” he admitted , when I asked him to explain the onslaught of freshly minted experts cheerleading for the deal . “ They were saying things that validated what we had given them to say . ”\nRhodes told Times reporter David Samuels that the marketing strategy took advantage of the “ absence of rational discourse ” and utilized outside groups , including Ploughshares .\nWhen I suggested that all this dark metafictional play seemed a bit removed from rational debate over America ’ s future role in the world , Rhodes nodded . “ In the absence of rational discourse , we are going to discourse the [ expletive ] out of this , ” he said . “ We had test drives to know who was going to be able to carry our message effectively , and how to use outside groups like Ploughshares , the Iran Project , and whomever else . So we knew the tactics that worked. ” He is proud of the way he sold the Iran deal . “ We drove them crazy , ” he said of the deal ’ s opponents .\nNow the AP has revealed the extent of Ploughshares funding to NPR and to influential foreign policy U.S. think tanks .\nPloughshares has funded NPR ’ s coverage of national security since 2005 , the radio network said . Ploughshares reports show at least $ 700,000 in funding over that time . All grant descriptions since 2010 specifically mention Iran . “ It ’ s a valued partnership , without any conditions from Ploughshares on our specific reporting , beyond the broad issues of national and nuclear security , nuclear policy , and nonproliferation , ” NPR said in an emailed statement . “ As with all support received , we have a rigorous editorial firewall process in place to ensure our coverage is independent and is not influenced by funders or special interests . ”\nAnother who appeared on NPR is Joseph Cirincione , Ploughshares ’ president . He spoke about the negotiations on air at least twice last year . The station identified Ploughshares as an NPR funder one of those times ; the other time , it didn ’ t .\nCirincione was an adviser on nuclear issues to Obama ’ s 2008 presidential campaign .\nPloughshares documents show funding last year to other groups to “ advance its nonproliferation agenda , ” according to the AP .\nThe Arms Control Association got $ 282,500 ; the Brookings Institution , $ 225,000 ; and the Atlantic Council , $ 182,500 . They received money for Iran-related analysis , briefings , and media outreach , and non-Iran nuclear work . Other groups , less directly defined by their independent nuclear expertise , also secured grants . J Street , the liberal Jewish political action group , received $ 576,500 to advocate for the deal . More than $ 281,000 went to the National Iranian American Council . Princeton University got $ 70,000 to support former Iranian ambassador and nuclear spokesman Seyed Hossein Mousavian ’ s “ analysis , publications , and policymaker engagement on the range of elements involved with the negotiated settlement of Iran ’ s nuclear program . ”\nPloughshares says it has awarded hundreds of grants “ whose aggregate value exceeded $ 60 million . ”\nA previous investigation by this reporter showed Ploughshares has partnered with a who ’ s who of the radical left , including Code Pink , the pro-Palestinian J Street , United for Peace & Justice , the U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation , and Demo , a progressive economic advisory group where President Obama ’ s controversial former green jobs czar , Van Jones , has served on the board .\nThe group says its mission is to support the “ smartest minds and most effective organizations to reduce nuclear stockpiles , prevent new nuclear states , and increase global security . ”\nPloughshares is in turn financed by Soros ’ Open Society Institute , the Buffett Foundation , the Carnegie Corporation of New York , the Ford Foundation , the Rockefeller Brothers Fund , and the Rockefeller Foundation .\nAnother Ploughshares donor is the Tides Foundation , which is one of the largest funders of the radical left .

    "392": "As always , a presidential tweet raises the obvious question . Tweeted the President :\n“ It ’ s very sad that Republicans , even some that were carried over the line on my back , do very little to protect their President . ”\n“ So why aren ’ t the Committees and investigators , and of course our beleaguered A.G. , looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes & Russia relations ? ”\nAnd the President isn ’ t the only one wondering where the GOP investigators are . Appearing on Fox News Monday , former Utah Congressman Jason Chaffetz made the same point , saying :\nRepublicans need to get a backbone . Every time the Democrats say they need to call up Jared Kushner or Don Jr. — call up Chelsea Clinton , call up the Clintons . There we have an inspector general who issues a report stating an actual crime . You have Bill Clinton , the former president , taking millions and millions of dollars from countries , that Hillary Clinton is going in and then doing business . So every time a Democrat says “ I got ta talk to Donald Trump Jr. , ” then go up and bring Chelsea Clinton in there , because she was involved in the Benghazi situation , she was involved with the ( Clinton ) Foundation .\nChaffetz added the obvious about some of these “ investigators. ” “ They would never , ever , ever do this to the Clintons. ” Exactly .\nLet ’ s be clear . There was no Trump collusion with Russians to steal the election . It didn ’ t happen . And making every contact with a Russian this-or-that into some sort of grand theft of democracy is ridiculous on its face . Recall that after making a big deal about Jared Kushner or then-Senator Jeff Sessions meeting with the Russian Ambassador , House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was asked the same question — had she ever met with the Russian Ambassador ? “ Not this one ” was her reply — only to have someone produce a photo of her taking a meeting with , yes indeed , the current Russian ambassador . Does this mean Pelosi lied ? Does this mean she was conspiring to steal the election with Russian help ? This is ridiculous .\nBut that hasn ’ t stopped Democrats from demanding — and getting — a “ special counsel ” to investigate the President . After the latter was personally told by then-FBI Director Comey that he wasn ’ t under investigation . And in true special prosecutor style , mission creep has already taken over the Robert Mueller investigation . What began as an investigation of Trump-Russian “ collusion ” to steal an election has now mission-creeped into a demand to look at the President ’ s finances . Headlined Bloomberg :\nThe U.S. special counsel investigating possible ties between the Donald Trump campaign and Russia in last year ’ s election is examining a broad range of transactions involving Trump ’ s businesses as well as those of his associates , according to a person familiar with the probe . FBI investigators and others are looking at Russian purchases of apartments in Trump buildings , Trump ’ s involvement in a controversial SoHo development in New York with Russian associates , the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow and Trump ’ s sale of a Florida mansion to a Russian oligarch in 2008 , the person said .\nGot that ? We have now gone from investigating whether Trump colluded with the Russians to steal the election to nosing into the sale of apartments to Russians years ago ? Votes for condos is the idea ? Seriously ? This investigation is out of control already .\nThis news coming on the heels of the realization that Mueller has staffed up with Clinton supporters , including one lawyer tied to the Clinton Foundation itself .\nThe question here is : Where are the Republicans ? Where are the demands to Mueller that if he is to expanding his Russia investigation then it ’ s past time to bring in the Clintons and investigate the pay-to-play use of the Clinton Foundation , that expensive Bill Clinton speech in Moscow , and the use of the State Department as the ultimate pay-to-play Clinton toy .\nNewsflash : Democrats and their media allies are playing hardball . They don ’ t want a debate on health care or taxes , they want to delegitimize and overthrow a duly elected President of the United States because they still can ’ t believe they lost the last election . Of all the people to finally come to grips with this reality , there was this from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer :\nSchumer : Dems , not Russia , are to blame for loss to Trump\n“ When you lose to somebody who has 40 percent popularity , you don ’ t blame other things — Comey , Russia — you blame yourself , ” Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) said in an interview previewing the new plan . “ So what did we do wrong ? People didn ’ t know what we stood for , just that we were against Trump . And still believe that . ”\nBut the GOP on Capitol Hill ? Here is Speaker Ryan per the Hill newspaper :\nSpeaker Ryan : Mueller is ‘ anything but ’ a Dem partisan Speaker Paul Ryan ( R-Wis. ) on Monday defended special counsel Robert Mueller , who is leading the Justice Department ’ s investigation into the Russia election interference , saying he ’ s “ anything but ” a Democratic partisan . “ I don ’ t think many people are saying Bob Mueller is a biased partisan . He ’ s really , sort of , anything but , ” Ryan said on the Wisconsin-based radio program “ The Jay Weber Show , ” which the Washington Examiner highlighted .\nIf true , how does the Speaker explain this from the Washington Free Beacon :\nMueller Hires Multiple Hillary Clinton Donors for Special Counsel Team Special counsel Robert Mueller has hired multiple donors who gave to Hillary Clinton ’ s presidential campaign to join his team investigating President Donald Trump . Federal records show that three attorneys who Mueller hired have made political donations , mostly to Democrats , CNN reports . Two of them gave the maximum contribution to Hillary Clinton ’ s 2016 campaign , while another donated to former President Barack Obama ’ s 2008 campaign and the Democratic National Committee . Trump ’ s supporters have begun casting doubt on the impartiality of Mueller and his team . Prominent Trump backer Newt Gingrich tweeted Monday that Mueller was unlikely to be fair .\nAs if that weren ’ t bad enough ? Recall this from Breitbart :\nSwamp Fights Back : Mueller Hires Clinton Foundation Lawyer for Russia Probe A more controversial pick of Mueller ’ s was former prosecutor and WilmerHale partner Jeannie Rhee . In 2015 , according to Politico , she performed work for the Clinton Foundation , defending it from FOIA requests related to Hillary Clinton ’ s private email server . These developments have raised some red flags on the right . For example , Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told Fox News , “ This is going to be a witch hunt . ”\nOver at the Daily Caller there was more from that Speaker Ryan radio interview . The incredible headline : Ryan :\nSpeaker of the House Paul Ryan said Monday that it isn ’ t congressional Republicans ’ role to defend President Trump from the investigations into Russian election interference…\nHere is Rush Limbaugh ’ s take on all of this on his Monday show , bold print for emphasis mine :\nWhat Trump is talking about here is : Why aren ’ t these Republican committees , why aren ’ t these Republican investigators — why isn ’ t my attorney general — looking into Hillary Clinton ’ s crimes ? If you ’ re gon na investigate what-all went on with Russia , how in the world do you leave the Democrats out of it ? How do you leave Hillary Clinton out of it ? The Republicans run the show ! It ’ s time for the Republicans to start acting like it . Politics is what it is . The Republicans don ’ t appear to want to play the game.… We can come up with all the guesses ( and we would be right eight out of 10 times ) why they ’ re not investigating Hillary , why they are not investigating the Democrats ’ connection with the Russians . By the way , there ’ s new news out today that the FBI did get hold of some computer equipment from Debbie “ Blabbermouth ” Schultz ’ s IT guy that they would not turn over to the FBI . There ’ s a potential gold mine there to be investigated of Hillary and the Democrats and the Democrat National Committee , and there just doesn ’ t seem ( that we know of , anyway ) to be any energy to uncover it . All of the energy seems to be focused on getting Trump and getting rid of Trump — which I , of course , am not denying that they want to do that . We ’ ve chronicled it here . But an opportunity is being squandered the likes of which ( chuckles ) we never thought we were gon na get . We hoped for it , and it probably is not something we could reasonably expect happen again . If it does , it ’ s only because the Democrats are so hapless .\nSpeaker Gingrich , as always , gets the deal on the spot . This is a witch-hunt designed to bring down the President . The presence of all those Clinton or Obama lawyers on the Mueller staff and the resulting lack of an investigation into the Clintons is no accident . Period . Who bought what Trump apartment years ago or the existence of a beauty pageant in Moscow in 2013 is utterly unrelated to the as-it-is bogus allegation that somehow Russians gave the election to Trump . But the Clinton Foundation-State Department-Clinton campaign Russia ties ? And a blind eye is turned ?\nAll of this and the GOP on Capitol Hill just turns away ? With no less than Speaker Ryan saying , as in the words of the Daily Caller , “ that it isn ’ t congressional Republicans ’ role to defend President Trump . ”\nExcuse me ? Politics is a team sport . Can anyone seriously say that Democrats didn ’ t spend eight years defending President Obama and his administration ? Or an earlier eight years defending President Clinton ? The reason a Democratic congressman makes news in criticizing Nancy Pelosi is that it is a rarity . And most assuredly any attack on her from Republicans would have Democrats jumping to defend her . As outrageous as ex-Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid could be , Democrats defended him to the hilt .\nAnd that statement by Chuck Schumer on Hillary Clinton ? It stands out because Democrats defended her relentlessly and not just as presidential candidate . From Benghazi to her e-mails , her tenure as Secretary of State was tenaciously defended by Democrats who made it their job to do so .\nPresident Trump is right . Jason Chaffetz is right . Republicans on Capitol Hill , busily backing away from a seven-year commitment to repeal and replace Obamacare , are yet again showing a lack of backbone not to mention elementary political common sense when it comes to defending the President . The latter , no small point , who is the leader of their party .\nWhich raises the question : Why should Republicans vote for a GOP House and Senate in the first place if they won ’ t stand up for the President Republicans voted for — not to mention that they can ’ t pass the agenda they campaigned on ?\nWhy indeed : 2018 could go down in history as the first time in history a party controlling Congress lost an election because their own party base thought they were better off without them . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "393": "The Making of the Fox News White House Fox News has always been partisan . But has it become propaganda ?\nIn which writer Jane Mayer — she the author of attack pieces over the years on every conservative from Justice Clarence Thomas and Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Koch brothers and Robert Mercer etc. , etc. , etc. , yada , yada , yada — mounts yet another attack on conservative targets , this one on Fox News , Sean Hannity , and , but of course , President Trump .\nSpecifically , she says that Fox News “ has evolved into something that hasn ’ t existed before in the United States. ” That would be “ state TV , ” as she quotes University of Virginia professor Nicole Hemmer . It quotes one Joe Peyronnin , a former Fox News president in the nineties and now a NYU journalism professor as saying : “ I ’ ve never seen anything like it before . It ’ s as if the President had his own press organization . It ’ s not healthy . ”\nThere is not the slightest sense of irony that in fact Mayer herself , not to mention the New Yorker , the magazine for which she writes , are members in good standing of the Liberal State Media . Which is to say she belongs to the world of liberal cable and broadcast networks , print outlets , all manner of Internet sites and , of course , Hollywood which individually not to mention collectively function as a self-selected version of Pravda ( “ Truth ” ) , the once-official newspaper of the Soviet Union ’ s Communist Party . The members of the Liberal State Media have one self-selected job , and one job only : they are in the Liberal Narrative business , relentlessly pushing into the media whatever is the liberal agenda of the day .\nAll the way back in 1969 then-Vice President Spiro Agnew gave a ground-breaking speech on the problem of the Liberal State Media as it existed in the day — which meant the three broadcast networks and the liberal print outlets . Agnew described the problem this way :\nNow what do Americans know of the men who wield this power ? Of the men who produce and direct the network news , the nation knows practically nothing . Of the commentators , most Americans know little other than that they reflect an urbane and assured presence , seemingly well-informed on every important matter . We do know that to a man these commentators and producers live and work in the geographical and intellectual confines of Washington , D.C. , or New York City , the latter of which ( New York Times columnist ) James Reston terms “ the most unrepresentative community in the entire United States . ”\nIn today ’ s world the Liberal State Media is run by both men and women and people of all races . Yet the problem is still the same as it was in 1969 : they all think the same , and that “ same ” means they all lean Left .\nWhich is to say the American Left has its own press operation . And the beauty of it is that it is self-initiating . Examples that Mayer mysteriously ignores ?\nDOCUMENTS SHOW MEDIA PLOTTING TO KILL STORIES ABOUT REV . JEREMIAH WRIGHT\nThe story by Jonathan Strong says , among other things , this :\nIt was the moment of greatest peril for then-Sen. Barack Obama ’ s political career . In the heat of the presidential campaign , videos surfaced of Obama ’ s pastor , the Rev . Jeremiah Wright , angrily denouncing whites , the U.S. government and America itself . Obama had once bragged of his closeness to Wright . Now the black nationalist preacher ’ s rhetoric was threatening to torpedo Obama ’ s campaign . The crisis reached a howling pitch in mid-April , 2008 , at an ABC News debate moderated by Charlie Gibson and George Stephanopoulos . Gibson asked Obama why it had taken him so long — nearly a year since Wright ’ s remarks became public — to dissociate himself from them . Stephanopoulos asked , “ Do you think Reverend Wright loves America as much as you do ? ” Watching this all at home were members of Journolist , a listserv comprised of several hundred liberal journalists , as well as like-minded professors and activists . The tough questioning from the ABC anchors left many of them outraged . “ George [ Stephanopoulos ] , ” fumed Richard Kim of the Nation , is “ being a disgusting little rat snake . ”\nIn other words their liberal colleague “ George ” — he the ex-Bill Clinton aide — had betrayed the cause by having the audacity to ask a tough question of the new Liberal State Media hero — Barack Obama . The story went on to say :\nOthers went further . According to records obtained by The Daily Caller , at several points during the 2008 presidential campaign a group of liberal journalists took radical steps to protect their favored candidate . Employees of news organizations including Time , Politico , the Huffington Post , the Baltimore Sun , the Guardian , Salon and the New Republic participated in outpourings of anger over how Obama had been treated in the media , and in some cases plotted to fix the damage . In one instance , Spencer Ackerman of the Washington Independent urged his colleagues to deflect attention from Obama ’ s relationship with Wright by changing the subject . Pick one of Obama ’ s conservative critics , Ackerman wrote , “ Fred Barnes , Karl Rove , who cares — and call them racists . ”\nIn another Daily Caller story by Strong there was this headline :\nGot all that ? The denizens of the Liberal State Media , angry that Fox News was disrupting the Liberal Narrative , wanted the Obama Administration to simply force Fox News off the air altogether .\nDisregarding the norms protecting press freedom , he ( now-White House Communications Director Bill Shine , a former Fox News co-president ) tried to strip the aggressive CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta of his White House pass .\nMysteriously , Mayer seems to have forgotten that Daily Caller exposé of the liberals at “ Journolist , ” which , again , reported this :\nIf this means that some White House reporters don ’ t get a press pass for the press secretary ’ s daily briefing and that this means that they actually have to , you know , do some reporting and analysis instead of repeating press releases , then I ’ ll take that risk .\nIn other words , for Bill Shine to pull the “ aggressive ” CNN reporter Acosta ’ s credentials was “ Disregarding the norms protecting press freedom… ” But when the liberals at Journolist were planning on finding a way to see to it that some Obama White House reporters — read , Fox News reporters — “ don ’ t get a press pass for the press secretary ’ s daily briefing ” ? Meaning give Fox the same treatment CNN would later receive ? Mayer somehow , some way , just can ’ t seem to remember that . Which is another way of saying that in the eyes of the Liberal State Media “ aggressive ” CNN is good when going after Trump , but an aggressive Fox going after Obama is outrageous , a cause to pull press credentials if not force the entire network off the air .\nThis entire “ Journolist ” project was , once exposed , a behind the scenes look at just how the Liberal State Media works in pushing the liberal agenda of the moment . And in fact , as Jonathan Strong revealed in yet another Daily Caller exposé :\nDespite its name , membership in the liberal online community Journolist wasn ’ t limited to journalists . Present among the bloggers , reporters and editors were a number of professional political operatives , including top White House economic advisors , key Obama political appointees , and Democratic campaign veterans . Some left government to join Journolist . Others took the opposite route . A few contributed to Journolist from their perches in politics . At times , it became difficult to tell who was supposed to be covering policy and who was trying to make it . ”\nAdded to the revelations about liberal journos plotting and planning Obama White House media strategy , there was this dust-up in 2013 — also during the Obama era . Stories surfaced about how literally incestuous the relationship between the liberal media and the liberal Obama administration really was . The Washington Post ’ s Paul Farhi wrote it this way :\nThe Farhi story recounted multiple specifics of journalists married to this or that Obama official . It said this , in part :\nIt ’ s all but a journalistic commandment : Thou shalt not have a vested interest in the story you ’ re covering . Otherwise , a personal entanglement could color a reporter ’ s neutrality or cloud public perceptions of fairness . An obvious area of concern : when a journalist ’ s relatives or spouse is part of the news . So what to make of all the family ties between the news media and the Obama administration ? … Conservatives have suggested that these relationships may play a role in how the media cover Obama , specifically in their supposedly timid approach to reporting on the White House ’ s handling of the terrorist attacks last year on American facilities in Benghazi , Libya . The National Review Online recently claimed that such ties amount to professional incest : “ The inbreeding among Obama ’ s court and its press corps is more like one of those ‘ I ’ m my own grandpaw ’ deals , ” wrote NRO ’ s Mark Steyn in a posting titled “ Band of Brothers. ” Such insinuations make media types bristle . They take exception to the notion that complicated judgments about the news — often made by others within an organization — have anything to do with personal favoritism or familial relationships . The critics , they say , can ’ t point to any direct evidence that such relationships have affected the amount or tone of their news coverage .\nTaken together with the “ Journolist ” revelations and it is crystal clear that yes , in fact , the real problem in the media today is not Fox News or Hannity or the Fox relationship with the Trump White House . The real problem for the Liberal State Media — for Mayer and her fellow liberal journalists — is the fact that it they are finally being beaten at their own game . Worse still , from their perspective , is that this is being accomplished by a president and his allies who have a serious understanding of just how the Liberal State Media plays the game .\nThere is not a single thing described in the Mayer piece that has not been done by the Liberal State Media over the decades . Here are a few examples .\nMayer writes : “ The White House and Fox interact so seamlessly that it can be hard to determine , during a particular news cycle , which one is following the other ’ s lead. ” Again , recall that Daily Caller story saying this : “ Despite its name , membership in the liberal online community Journolist wasn ’ t limited to journalists . Present among the bloggers , reporters and editors were a number of professional political operatives , including top White House economic advisors , key Obama political appointees , and Democratic campaign veterans . ”\nMayer writes of the relationship between Bill Shine and Sean Hannity this way : “ … they are godfathers to each other ’ s children… they spend their vacations together… . They talked all the time-many times a day. ” Not mentioned ? That story about the oh-so-close ties between Obama officials and various members of the liberal media — who were also either spouses or siblings . Recall this quote that Mayer ignored : “ The inbreeding among Obama ’ s court and its press corps is more like one of those ‘ I ’ m my own grandpaw ’ deals , ” wrote NRO ’ s Mark Steyn in a posting titled “ Band of Brothers . ”\nMayer writes of “ The Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin , another conservative Never Trumper… ” Ignored completely was the letter awhile back by 37 prominent conservatives in the American Principles Project to the Washington Post , which said in part :\nWe , of course , respect the right of The Washington Post to employ whatever writers it pleases — even Jennifer Rubin . However , we ask for the sake of intellectual honesty that the Post cease to identify her as in any way “ conservative. ” … Anyone following Rubin ’ s writing closely at this point would rightfully find the claim that she is “ conservative ” laughable . And yet , she is still regularly touted in the media as a conservative voice — and by your own paper as “ reporting from a center-right perspective. ” … This issue exemplifies why so many Americans — particularly conservatives — hold a high distrust of the media . How can an average reader take the Post ’ s opinion section seriously when , of its numerous regular columnists , none can be found which defend the policies of our nation ’ s elected president ?\nMayer writes , aghast , of Trump appointees Ben Carson , John Bolton , K.T . McFarland , Heather Nauert , and Sebastian Gorka as having previously been contributors or commentators on Fox . Ignoring that all of these people had substantial careers outside of Fox News before their Fox stints . And quite decidedly ignoring Liberal State Media stars like Jay Carney of Time ( who became White House press secretary ) , Rick Stengel , also of Time ( the managing editor ) who served in the Obama State Department , and Strobe Talbott , another Time alum who served in the Clinton State Department . Which is to say , there is a long revolving-door history of media figures serving in an administration .\nMayer writes of the Trump-Hannity relationship as if a close relationship between a president and a media personality is somehow new . While she does mention the role of the then-Washington Post publisher Phil Graham in getting Lyndon Johnson on the JFK Democratic ticket in 1960 , she ignores the close friendship between JFK and then-Newsweek Washington Bureau chief Ben Bradlee , which Bradlee himself discussed in his memoirs . In other words , if the president is Trump and the media figure is Sean Hannity or Rupert Murdoch — this is somehow terrible . But JFK and his pal Ben Bradlee , or Bill Clinton and his pal CNN president Rick Kaplan ? The latter relationship resulting in CNN being dubbed the “ Clinton News Network ” ? No problem . Nary a mention for context here .\nMayer refers several times to the far-left Media Matters , as if the latter were a legitimate source on anything having to do with Fox , Hannity , or Shine . As noted in this 2012 Daily Caller story about Media Matters :\nFounded by ( David ) Brock in 2004 as a liberal counterweight to “ conservative misinformation ” in the press , Media Matters has in less than a decade become a powerful player in Democratic politics . The group operates in regular coordination with the highest levels of the Obama White House , as well as with members of Congress and progressive groups around the country .\nNever mentioned is that Media Matters founder Brock authored a book titled The Fox Effect : How Roger Ailes Turned a Network into a Propaganda Machine . Notice anything ? Yes , indeed . The subtitle of Mayer ’ s article asks if Fox News “ has become propaganda. ” And for confirmation she goes to Media Matters — whose founder wrote a book assailing Fox as a “ propaganda machine ” in — 2012 . That would be four years before Donald Trump was elected president . Which is to say , the business of the Liberal State Media attacking Fox as all about being a “ propaganda machine ” — not to mention going after the Trump White House , Bill Shine , Rupert Murdoch , and Sean Hannity — is not only not new , it long predated Trump ’ s rise to the White House .\nMayer , in blithely and repeatedly citing Media Matters as a source , also never mentions this Daily Caller story that reveals “ Media Matters has perhaps achieved more influence simply by putting its talking points into the willing hands of liberal journalists . ”\nLiberal journalists like — Jane Mayer ? Hmmm . A visit to the Media Matters website finds this admiring headline :\nOn MSNBC , The New Yorker ’ s Jane Mayer describes the “ incredibly close ” relationship between the White House and Fox News Mayer : “ According to a number of critics , [ Fox is ] the closest we ’ ve ever had to state news.… People describe it to me as a wing of the West Wing . ”\nAhhhh , the Liberal State Media at work . From Mayer at the New Yorker to MSNBC to Media Matters and on into the world of the Liberal State Media ’ s Liberal Narrative .\nUnless , of course , you are a member of the Liberal State Media . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "394": "The fight over same-sex marriage licenses may not end in Kentucky .\nIn Texas , Alabama and elsewhere a number of clerks and judges who stated their opposition to gay marriage have thrown up roadblocks to the unions , extending the fight over same-sex weddings two months after the U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage .\nGalvanizing opponents of gay marriage , Kim Davis , a county clerk in rural Kentucky , this week was jailed for her refusal to issue marriage licenses on the basis that same-sex unions conflict with her Christian beliefs .\nOthers with the power to issue marriage licenses say they would be willing to follow suit , including Alabama Probate Judge Nick Williams .\n`` Absolutely , I feel the same way . This is a cause worth standing up for , '' said Williams , who ordered his deputies in Washington County not to issue any licenses at all since the court 's June decision .\nThe fight has made Davis a martyr-like figure for religious conservatives who argue she is being jailed for her religious beliefs , a view espoused by several Republican presidential candidates .\nBut for legal experts and gay marriage advocates , the issue is clear . Gay marriage is the law of the land and public servants are bound to uphold the decision of the justices .\n`` In this big country , it 's not surprising that there have been a handful of isolated instances of acting out and foot-dragging , '' said Evan Wolfson , founder and president of Freedom to Marry , a same-sex marriage advocate .\nIn rural Irion County , Texas , the issuing of licenses to same-sex couples remains ambiguous .\nThe American Civil Liberties Union , which filed suit against Davis , said it knows of only two counties in Texas that have not confirmed whether they will issue same-sex marriage licenses .\n`` We are not going to discuss marriage policy over the phone . If a couple comes in to apply , we will discuss it at that time , '' said Molly Criner , a clerk in Irion County , which has about 1,600 people located 200 miles ( 320 km ) northwest of Austin .\nCriner is one of several public officials with the power to issue marriage licenses who stands against gay marriage for religious grounds , and has yet to face a challenge .\nIn Irion County , no same-sex couples have applied and no same-sex licenses have been issued .\n`` To keep my oath to uphold the Constitution , I must reject this ruling that I believe is lawless , '' she was quoted as saying by Liberty Counsel , a Florida-based Christian religious advocacy organization that said it would back her legally .\nThe group , which also supports Davis , said it represents other county clerks who have yet to face challenges . It is not naming them .\n`` We have been contacted by other clerks in Kentucky . We 've been contacted by other clerks in other parts of the country , '' said Liberty Counsel founder Mathew Staver , the attorney for Kim Davis .\nThe fight has not been isolated to socially conservative southern states , all of which had bans on same-sex marriage .\nIn left-leaning Oregon , Marion County Circuit Court Judge Vance Day is facing an ethics review over his refusal to perform same-sex marriages . On Thursday , the Oregon Government Ethics Commission approved Day 's request to set up a Legal Expense Trust Fund to raise money for his defense .\nUnlike Kentucky , Alabama 's law says judges `` may '' issue licenses , with some interpreting the wording as `` may not . ''\n`` I 'm the elected probate judge and that 's my decision . Thank you , '' said Alabama 's Geneva County Probate Judge Fred Hamic , before hanging up his phone .\nThat interpretation in Alabama largely took hold after U.S. District Judge Callie Granade , of the southern district of Alabama , overturned the state 's ban on same-sex marriage in January .\nThe Association of County Commissions of Alabama in Montgomery said that up to 12 counties are not issuing any marriage licenses .\nThat includes Washington County , where Williams , the probate judge , said he spoke with Davis for 10 minutes the day before she was ordered into custody .\n`` I asked her if she was prepared for whichever the way the judge ruled and she said yes . She was very much at peace , '' said Williams .\nThe fight could also return to Kentucky . Casey Davis , who is no relation to Kim Davis , serves as the clerk for Casey County , which is not issuing any marriage licenses . Attempts to reach Casey Davis were unsuccessful .\nWhitley County , Kentucky Clerk Kay Schwartz did not respond to repeated calls and on Friday was on vacation . Her office previously said they were issuing traditional marriage licenses for men and women , but no one had asked for a same-sex license .\nIn the end , all counties will be issuing the licenses because it is the law of the land , said Wolfson of Freedom to Marry . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "395": "In an extensive article published last month that included interviews with more than 30 current and former law enforcement officials , congressional officials and other government employees , the New York Times published a stinging indictment of James B. Comey ’ s handling of the Hillary Clinton email probe .\nThe Times made the case that Comey violated FBI tradition , bypassed the Justice Department and went rogue on several occasions in a manner that clearly impacted the 2016 presidential election .\nIn a letter on Tuesday from Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein recommending that Comey be fired , Rosenstein specifically cited Comey ’ s alleged mishandling of the Clinton email probe as justification for Comey ’ s removal from office .\n“ I can not defend the Director ’ s handling of the conclusion of the investigation of secretary Clinton ’ s emails , ” Rosenstein wrote . “ And I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken . Almost everyone agrees that the Director made serious mistakes ; it is one of the few issues that unites people of diverse perspectives . ”\nRosenstein continued : “ The Director was wrong to usurp the Attorney General ’ s authority on July 5 , 2016 , and announce his conclusion that the case should be closed without prosecution . It is not the function of the Director to make such an announcement . At most , the Director should have said the FBI had completed its investigation and presented its findings to federal prosecutors . ”\nThat is precisely the case made by the Times ’ April 22 article , titled , “ Comey Tried to Shield the F.B.I . From Politics . Then He Shaped an Election . ”\nThe Times says that for its article it interviewed “ more than 30 current and former law enforcement , congressional and other government officials . ”\nThe newspaper concluded that Comey ’ s decision to inform Congress that the FBI was reopening the Clinton email probe less than two weeks before the presidential election “ violate [ ed ] the policies of an agency that does not reveal its investigations or do anything that may influence an election . ”\nThe article related that Comey decided to plunge the FBI “ into the molten center of a bitter election ” in part because he feared “ the backlash that would come if it were revealed after the election that the F.B.I . had been investigating the next president and had kept it a secret . ”\nA significant motivating factor for Comey ’ s rogue approach toward the Clinton email probe , the Times revealed , was his distrust of senior officials at the Justice Department , especially then-Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch , whom , the newspaper reported , “ Mr . Comey believed had subtly helped play down the Clinton investigation . ”\nIndeed , according to the Times , Comey was aware of the existence of a document written by a Democratic operative that allegedly indicated Lynch would have protected Hillary Clinton in the email probe .\nThe FBI had further information that the alleged Lynch document had been hacked by Russian intelligence , leading Comey to fear that Moscow could leak the document to call into question the independence of the U.S. government ’ s Clinton email probe , the Times reported .\nIn his letter from Tuesday , Rosenstein argues that if Comey believed Lynch to be compromised he should have sought her recusal instead of taking matters into his own hands .\n“ The Director now defends his decision by asserting that he believed Attorney General Lynch had a conflict , ” Rosenstein wrote . “ But the FBI Director is never empowered to supplant federal prosecutors and assume command of the Justice Department . There is a well-established process for other officials to step in when a conflict requires the recusal of the Attorney General . ”\nIndeed , according to the Times , after it became clear that the F.B.I . did not discover Clinton emails showing intent to mishandle classified information – the agency believed those emails were among the correspondence deleted by Clinton – Comey made the decision to bypass the Justice Department and explain the case to the public .\nNine months into the investigation , it became clear to Mr. Comey that Mrs. Clinton was almost certainly not going to face charges . He quietly began work on talking points , toying with the notion that in the midst of a bitter presidential campaign , a Justice Department led by Democrats may not have the credibility to close the case , and that he alone should explain that decision to the public .\nComey ’ s decision was further fueled by the alleged document written by a Democratic operative hacked by the Russians , a document that in Comey ’ s view raised “ questions about [ Lynch ’ s ] independence , ” the Times reported .\nInstead of seeking Lynch ’ s recusal , as Rosenstein would later outline as the proper course of action , Comey decided to go at it alone , take matters into his own hands and make his public pronouncements about Clinton ’ s email case without the Justice Department .\nThe Times cited former Justice officials as “ deeply skeptical ” of Comey ’ s alleged reasoning :\nFormer Justice Department officials are deeply skeptical of this account . If Mr. Comey believed that Ms. Lynch were compromised , they say , why did he not seek her recusal ? Mr. Comey never raised this issue with Ms. Lynch or the deputy attorney general , Sally Q. Yates , former officials said .\nMr. Comey ’ s defenders regard this as one of the untold stories of the Clinton investigation , one they say helps explain his decision-making . But former Justice Department officials say the F.B.I . never uncovered evidence tying Ms. Lynch to the document ’ s author , and are convinced that Mr. Comey wanted an excuse to put himself in the spotlight .\nComey ’ s decision to go rogue was solidified , according to the Times ’ account , after Lynch ’ s infamous tarmac meeting at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport in which former President Bill Clinton , the husband of the FBI ’ s main subject in a criminal probe , boarded the attorney general ’ s plane and reportedly stayed there for about twenty minutes .\nYet Comey still did not seek Lynch ’ s recusal . The Times article related that after the tarmac episode , Comey “ knew for sure that when there was something to say about the case , he alone would say it . ”\nAfterwards , Comey held the press conference at which he criticized Clinton ’ s private email server as “ extremely careless ” before finally stating that “ no charges are appropriate in this case . ”\nWith his pronouncements , Comey offered judgments and legal conclusions many argue are out of the purview of the FBI , which is charged with documenting the evidence and handing it over to the Justice Department .\nThe Times cited unnamed “ frustrated ” prosecutors at the Justice Department complaining that Comey should have first consulted with them .\nComey ’ s injection into the presidential race did not end there . Less than two weeks before the election , the FBI discovered a trove of Clinton emails on the laptop of Anthony Weiner , the estranged husband of long-time top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin . Some of the emails , according to reports , originated on Clinton ’ s old BlackBerry server that she used before setting up her private home server and some believe may have contained the deleted messages .\nComey ’ s decision centered on whether to follow FBI tradition and keep quiet about the reopening of the case , or inform Congress about the ongoing investigation , which , the Times related , “ everyone acknowledged would create a political furor . ”\nEventually , Comey decided to go rogue again and inform Congress .\nLynch was against the decision , the Times reported , and the Justice Department implored the FBI not to impact the presidential campaign in its final days . The Times reported that “ even at the F.B.I. , agents who supported their high-profile director were stunned . ”\n“ Career prosecutors and political appointees ” at the Justice Department quietly criticized not only Comey but Lynch for failing to stop the FBI director , the Times documented .\nA chorus of former attorneys general and deputy attorneys general from across the political spectrum publicly criticized Comey ’ s move . For example , Jamie S. Gorelick , who served as deputy attorney general during the Clinton administration , opined that Comey was “ damaging our democracy . ”\nWriting in the Washington Post on October 29 , Gorelick slammed Comey ’ s decision to so publicly reopen the case just before the election as “ antithetical to the interests of justice , putting a thumb on the scale of this election and damaging our democracy . ”\nGorelick co-authored the Washington Post opinion piece , titled , “ James Comey is damaging our democracy , ” with Larry Thompson , who served under the George W. Bush administration as deputy attorney general from 2001 to 2003 .\nGorelick ’ s piece was referenced in Rosenstein ’ s letter on Tuesday recommending that Comey be fired , writing , “ I can not defend the director ’ s handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton ’ s emails . ”\nRosenstein referenced the criticism of Comey from other former attorneys general and deputy attorneys general .\nFormer Attorney General Michael Mukasey , who served under President George W. Bush , observed that the Director stepped far outside his purview in disclosing the recommendation in that fashion “ because the FBI director doesn ’ t make that decision . ”\nAlberto Gonzales , who also served as Attorney General under President George W. Bush , called the decision an error in judgment .\nEric Holder , who served as Deputy Attorney General under President Clinton and Attorney General under President Obama , said that the Director ’ s decision “ was incorrect . It violated long-standing Justice Department policies and traditions. ” Holder concluded that the Director broke with these fundamental principles and negatively affected public trust in both the Justice Department and the FBI .\nDonald Ayer , who served as Deputy Attorney General under President George H.W . Bush , along with other former Justice Department officials , was “ astonished and perplexed ” by the decision to “ break with longstanding practices followed by officials of both parties during past elections . ”\nAaron Klein is Breitbart ’ s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter .

The opinion that the author was trying to convey was his belief that nobody in their right mind would think that Trump was literally suggesting that people should inject disinfectant into their bodies – which is how many in the media were portraying the President ’ s comments at yesterday ’ s press conference .

We apologize for the error , and you are welcome for all the opportunities to dunk on us on Twitter .\nAfter yesterday ’ s Coronavirus Task Force press briefing , the media quickly seized on a discussion over potential treatments for the coronavirus COVID-19 where the president asked about the potential for a disinfectant injection .\n“ And then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute . One minute . And is there a way we can do something like that , by injection inside or almost a cleaning ? ” The President said . “ So it ’ d be interesting to check that . ”\nThe President told a group of reporters Friday that he was being sarcastic .\nIn Thursday ’ s White House coronavirus task force briefing , Bill Bryan , leader of the Science and Technology Directorate at the Department of Homeland Security , described the results of new government research that showed that the coronavirus did not survive long in solar light , warmer temperatures , and more humid conditions .

    "397": "The election of Donald Trump has n't just brought a poorly mannered reality TV star into the Oval Office and our newsfeeds . It has also popularized the concept of gaslighting , or tricking rational people into thinking they 're insane . The phrase is a reference to a 1944 movie in which Charles Boyer tries to convince his young bride , played by Ingrid Bergman , that she 's nuts so he can cover up a murder and search for jewels hidden in the house they share ( the house 's gas lamps flicker due to Boyer 's late-night searches , hence the title ) .\nGo Google `` Donald Trump is gaslighting America '' and you 'll find a constantly growing list of stories from outlets ranging from CNN to Teen Vogue to Vanity Fair to Refinery 29 . The common thread is some variation on the theme that Trump 's brazen lies , misstatements , and rhetorical sleights of hand are designed to drive us all batshit crazy by contradicting what we plainly see happening to the United States of America . At rock bottom , Trump 's detractors believe there is simply no way that he could have legitimately won the 2016 election , especially against Hillary Clinton , of whom President Obama said , `` I do n't think that there 's ever been someone so qualified to hold this office . ''\nYet it 's not Donald Trump who is gaslighting us , but Hillary Clinton , whose complete and utter refusal to take responsibility for her loss is at the heart of what 's so weird about contemporary America . You read it here first : Trump is the effect and not the cause of the ongoing mudslide that is the daily news . Ever since about 11 p.m . ET on November 8 , 2016 , Clinton and her allies in the media have worked overtime to provide increasingly fanciful explanations for her failure to beat the least-credible candidate ever in American history . Sometimes the apologias are conscious , sometimes not , but nobody really wants to accept what happened ( in fact , even Trump himself could n't believe it for a while , which helps explain why his transition was so incompetent ) . The result is a non-stop barrage of stories , some more credible than others , that Trump 's win was the result of some sort of sinister machination that has undermined our democracy . Following from this interpretation every aspect of his behavior , from his bro-ing out with Vladimir Putin to his indifferent spelling and capitalization while tweeting , is just one more sign that we are living in a world gone stark , raving mad .\nTo be fair , Trump trades in delusion , such as his insistence that violent crime is at or near all-time highs , that massive voter fraud was the only ███ he lost the popular vote , and that his inauguration was the most-viewed ever . These sorts of patently false statements do indeed constitute attempts at gaslighting . So , too , do his unconvincing denials about a sexual relationship with the porn star known as Stormy Daniels , his doctor 's statement that he only weighs 239 lbs . ( giving rise to the `` Girther '' movement ) , and his fanciful stories about how Japanese car makers use bowling balls in quality-assurance tests . Against such a backdrop , even the president 's so-far-not-contradicted denial that his campaign colluded with Russia seems like a form of gaslighting . In fact , everything he says seems like it 's intended to drive us insane or at least seriously question basic reality .\nOn their face , this week 's exposes about Cambridge Analytica , the market-research firm that harvested information from as many as 50 million * Facebook users while working for the Trump campaign , do n't just further the Trump-gaslighting narrative ; they pour gasoline on it . Finally , you can hear # NeverTrump partisans and # theResistance cells all over the country scream with relief , we finally know how he won ! While previous explanations have yet to be vindicated by evidence ( the Russians hacked it ! ) , widely embraced ( the GOP suppressed the minority vote ! ) , or pass the laugh test ( white women succumbed to `` ongoing pressure to vote the way that your husband , your boss , your son , whoever , believes you should '' ) , the notion that Trump dialed deep into our psychographic hearts of darkness seems self-evident . As The Guardian puts it , Cambridge Analytica was not only able `` to turn tens of millions of Facebook profiles into a unique political weapon , '' it `` also attracted interest from a key Russian firm with links to the Kremlin . '' Christopher Wylie , the magenta-haired `` data war whistleblower , '' is not exactly measured when he dishes on how he created `` Steven Bannon 's pyschological warfare mindfuck tool '' that launched `` an extraordinary attack on the U.S. 's democratic process . ''\nWhat a gift to all of us Ingrid Bergmans suffering under the depredations of latter-day Charles Boyers ! The large takeaway from the Cambridge Analytica story is supposed to be that of all the sad sacks in the Western world , Donald Trump and his former Minister of Dark Arts , Steve Bannon—currently palling around with French ultra-rightists—had super-special treachery that helped them steal an election properly owed to Hillary Clinton . We can finally rest easy knowing that , to paraphrase the final line of King Kong , `` It was n't Trump 's overt racism and appeals to our basest instincts , it was social media that killed the Clinton campaign . ''\nAnd yet the Cambridge Analytica angle is pretty much horseshit . Recall that the firm had a remarkably weak track record when it worked with the awful Ted Cruz campaign before getting hired by the Trump folks and that `` even Cambridge Analytica did n't believe its own hype . '' Or that a New York Times reporter , Kenneth P. Vogel , tweeted this week , `` It was ( & is ) an overpriced service that delivered little value to the TRUMP campaign , & the other campaigns & PACs that retained it — most of which hired the firm because it was seen as a prerequisite for receiving $ $ $ from the MERCERS . ''\nIn a smart piece published earlier this week , National Review 's Michael Brendan Dougherty argues that the liberal-leaning solons of Silicon Valley and folks in the media are in the middle of creating a moral panic over social media now that they realize it may be used by right-of-center folks just as effectively ( or not ) as by left-of-center types :\nSilicon Valley is working with its media and governmental critics to limit the damage to the center-Left going forward . You can see the dynamic in the way that the media generates a moral panic out of stories about how Brexit and the Trump election happened , and the way Silicon Valley responds . Fake news becomes a problem , and Silicon Valley responds by hiring progressive journalists as censors . I mean `` fact-checkers . '' You can see it in the demonetization of YouTube videos . Or in the new sets of regulation being imposed in European countries that deputize the social-media networks themselves as an all seeing social censor .\nDougherty notes that when the Obama campaign used Facebook and other forms of social media to win its presidential races , the press swooned . Writing in MIT 's Technology Review in 2012 , Sasha Issenberg gushed that Obama 's team had created `` a new political currency that predicted the behavior of individual humans . The campaign did n't just know who you were ; it knew exactly how it could turn you into the type of person it wanted you to be . '' That , says Dougherty , was just one more sign that Barack got it , that he was an iPod-using cool kid :\nToday 's Cambridge Analytica scandal causes our tech chin-strokers to worry about `` information '' you did not consent to share , but the Obama team created social interactions you would n't have had . They did n't just build a psychological profile of persuadable voters , and algorithmically determine ways of persuading them , but actually encouraged particular friends — ones the campaign had profiled as influencers — to reach out to them personally . In a post-election interview , the campaign 's digital director Teddy Goff explained the strategy : `` People do n't trust campaigns . They do n't even trust media organizations , '' he told Time 's Michael Sherer , `` Who do they trust ? Their friends ? '' This level of manipulation was celebrated in the press .\nBut all of this presupposes that the ███ why Trump won and Clinton lost was because the billionaire availed himself of unfair , shady , and possibly illegal information . And while there 's little doubt that Facebook needs to `` step up '' regarding its privacy policies ( in the words of Mark Zuckerberg ) , the reality is less interesting but ultimately more convincing . Exit polls showed that Clinton simply did n't turn out the voters she needed to in order to win . Around 136 million votes were cast and it turned out that about 77,000 of them in Pennsylvania , Wisconsin , and especially Michigan determined the outcome . Republicans and Democrats can reliably turn out a certain minimum number of voters ; in presidential contests , the winner will be the one who either generates more enthusiasm ( such as Barack Obama did in 2008 and 2012 ) among partisans , or does n't completely turn off his own party members ( Trump ) . Hillary Clinton ignored at her peril voters in states that she assumed to be locks for her .\nIn December 2016 , Politico 's Edward-Isaac Dovere * noted that Clinton managed to lose Michigan , which had voted Democratic in the past six presidential elections . * Yet `` Trump won the state despite getting 30,000 fewer votes than George W. Bush did when he lost it in 2004 . '' Dovere argues :\nIn results that narrow , Clinton 's loss could be attributed to any number of factors — FBI Director Jim Comey 's letter shifting late deciders , the lack of a compelling economic message , the apparent Russian hacking . But heartbroken and frustrated in-state battleground operatives worry that a lesson being missed is a simple one : Get the basics of campaigning right . Clinton never even stopped by a United Auto Workers union hall in Michigan , though a person involved with the campaign noted bitterly that the UAW flaked on GOTV commitments in the final days , and that AFSCME never even made any , despite months of appeals .\nInstead of nailing down every electoral vote in less-glamorous precincts , the Clinton campaign spent time raising money and running up popular vote counts in California and New York ( she won the popular vote by about 3 million ) . The same take-it-for-granted attitude that led to her loss was on brazen display in her recent comments to an Indian audience , where she explained `` I won the places that represent two-thirds of America 's gross domestic product… I won the places that are optimistic , diverse , dynamic , moving forward… . We do n't do well with married , white women…and part of that is an identification with the Republican Party , and a sort of ongoing pressure to vote the way that your husband , your boss , your son , whoever , believes you should . ''\nWhenever an election is unexpectedly close , there will always be weird things that crop up to `` explain '' the result . But just as with George W. Bush 's razor-thin victory in 2000 , the real question is n't what put the underdog over the top but how the hell the odds-on favorite managed to squander such a lead . In 2000 , Bush did n't win so much as Al Gore lost . So it is with 2016 : Trump did n't win as much as Hillary Clinton did everything possible to lose . And now we are paying for her loss by being treated to an endless procession of explanations that will take the measure of every possible ███ except for her own incompetence , arrogance , and sense of entitlement .\n* CORRECTIONS : I originally claimed that the profiles of 30 million Facebook users had been compromised . The correct figure is 50 million . Edward-Isaac Dovere 's was name misstated as Edward Isaac-Dovere . I wrote , `` Politico 's Edward Isaac-Dovere noted that had Clinton managed to hold Michigan , which had voted Democratic in the past six presidential elections , she would be president today .

    "398": "Jim Acosta of CNN and other media personalities get exercised when the President calls Fake News the “ enemy of the people. ” President Trump does not call all news outlets or personalities by that term — only the Fake News . Certainly , that term is quite an incendiary sobriquet . The President reciprocates with it because he gets attacked with incendiary abuse . No American President in memory has been picked on and lied about with the intensity and frequency that President Trump has had to endure .\nThe media — because it is almost-monolithically Left-Democrat — regularly depicted Ronald Reagan as a moron , occasionally tying him to a movie in which he acted , Bedtime for Bonzo , where he went to bed in one scene alongside a chimpanzee . ( They forget that he was cast in the film as a university professor . ) Reagan endured it , avoided reciprocal name-calling , and history unequivocally has registered that he actually was quite brilliant , understood what so many others could not grasp , revived the moribund Jimmy Carter economy with creative strategies and tax-cutting boldness that George H.W . Bush myopically had called “ Voodoo Economics , ” stared down Mikhail Gorbachev and defeated a century of Communism , and launched an anti-ballistic military focus that his enemies mocked as “ Star Wars ” but that today is central to protecting Western democracies from incoming ballistic missiles . The “ Iron Dome ” missile-defense system that Israel has used so effectively against Gaza Hamas terrorist rockets is the fruit of “ Star Wars . ”\nThe Left Media almost universally depicted the brilliant Reagan as an idiot , and he somehow shrugged it off . Donald Trump is different because we do not manufacture our Presidents with interchangeable parts on an assembly line . It very well may be that the past week ’ s Pittsburgh terrorist attack , and the way the President responded , and the way the Left Media then hit the President viciously anyway is the “ Rosetta Stone ” — the small piece of archaeological evidence historians will need — to decipher that Donald Trump was right to call the Fake News Left Media the “ enemy of the people . ”\n1 . “ The People ” Benefit From a Robust and Independent Press — and a Fake News Regime Indeed Is the Enemy of the People\n“ The People ” indeed benefit from a robust “ press ” — more accurately called “ media ” in this digital age of televised news , digital internet-based news , and so much more than the mere newsprint “ press. ” If Stalin ’ s Soviet Russia had been covered by a robust media ( and if such media could have survived ) , “ The People ” would have learned that Stalin ’ s five-year economic plans disastrously were failing and were leading to mass starvation , moreover that he consciously was perpetrating genocide by starving millions of Ukrainians to death in the Golodomor , that he was putting millions of prisoners to work in tundra prisons to dig through ice manually to build canals and other infrastructure . An honest news media would have alerted the West , too , that Stalin was murdering millions . The New York Times had a sycophantically pro-Stalin liar , Walter Duranty , filing Fake News reports from the Soviet Union for more than ten years . The Times published the lies daily as “ news ” and made him their Moscow bureau chief for fourteen years . As a result , the West was lulled , cheated of the truth , made unaware of the evil . Yes , the Fake News indeed was the enemy of the people .\nLikewise , the New York Times— and the other mainstream media who took their lead from them — by and large refused to report on the unfolding Nazi Holocaust of six million Jews . Between 1939 and 1945 , the New York Times published more than 23,000 front-page stories . Of those , 11,500 were about World War II . Only twenty-six — in six years — were about the Holocaust . The Times was passively complicit .\nA robust newsmedia can save lives by exposing and revealing , while a Fake News regime can serve to assist in the despoiling of a people . When media foist false narratives to sow social discord , or when they assist tyranny with falsehoods , they indeed are the enemy of the people .\nSocial discord leads to streets being set on fire — witness Ferguson and Baltimore during the Obama Years . Social discord dispirits potentially valuable citizens who could help build a society , instead turning them against that society and motivating them to work towards its downfall or simply to drop out . In its worst aspect , social discord leads to armed insurrection and civil war . If the problem is that a Stalin is murdering millions by deliberately starving them while incarcerating millions others in slave camps in the Gulag , then insurrection and civil war can be righteous , potentially saving such a despoiled society . But when the society actually is doing quite well , when freedom reigns and people of all colors , creeds , religions , and ethnicities are enjoying remarkable opportunities to succeed and to live wonderfully rich and precious lives alongside their neighbors in respectful diversity , then Fake News media indeed are the enemy of the people when they seek to sow social discord in that welcome environment , aiming to up-end civil harmony .\nA maniacal dirtbag murdered eleven Jews in Pittsburgh . In time , perhaps after a decade or two of ACLU appeals , he will be electrocuted , injected , hanged , or hopefully all three . The dirtbag hated Jews , and he likewise hated President Trump . President Trump responded to the news immediately with profoundly sensitive and healing words aimed at condemning anti-Semitism and at comforting and consoling the Jewish community . Listen to his words . If the role of a President is to heal and unify , as President Reagan did after the Challenger tragedy , as President Bush did after 9-11 , then this President did so eloquently , sensitively . And then came the sowers of social discord to destroy the moment… .\nThe Left Media would not allow the President that moment to heal and unify . Instantly , they brought in one Left-Democrat anti-Trump “ analyst ” after another to blame Mr. Trump for the attack . They never blamed President Jimmy Carter ’ s anti-Jewish rhetoric for the 1977 Brith Sholom Kneseth Israel synagogue shooting in St. Louis . Nor Bill Clinton for the 1994 Brooklyn Bridge shootings of yeshiva students that included the murder of Ari Halberstam . Nor Clinton ’ s rhetoric for the 1999 Granada Hills Jewish Community Center shooting in Los Angeles . Nor Obama for the deadly 2009 Holocaust Museum shooting in Washington , D.C . Nor Obama for the 2014 Overland Park Jewish Community Center shootings in Kansas City that murdered three . But this time — with the same social dynamics as the others — they tried blaming the President . By sowing social discord with outright absolute falsehoods at a time that called for healing , the Left Media indeed were acting as enemy of the people .\nFacts are different from opinions . Facts can be discerned and evidenced . There is a reason that as many as 82 percent of Israeli Jews love President Trump , that more than 90 percent of American Orthodox Jews support President Trump . Likewise , a huge majority of British Jews — by more than three-to-one — support England ’ s conservative party and despise the Labour Socialists . Similarly , millions of Jews who have left the former Soviet Union hate Marxism and socialism , are solidly capitalist and conservative , indeed have changed the face of Israeli politics towards the more conservative Likud , now led by Benjamin Netanyahu . Throughout the world , Jews now vote conservative , are conservative — as reflected in our country , too , by American Orthodox Jews . The independent Pew Research Center has found that the Orthodox Jewish community will be the predominant Jewish community in a few decades , as the others disappear . Just as the voting patterns of the American Deep South have changed 180 degrees from Democrat to Republican in the century since the Civil War , so is the American Jewish metamorphosis now on pace to synchronize with every other Jewish community in the world that has moved towards conservatism . But Jews are not monolithic , as witness those in Hollywood and in certain media .\nSo look at what the Fake News Left Media did after President Trump healed and unified : They received a news release from a small , utterly insignificant , nothing of a Radical Leftist group , calling itself “ Bend the Arc , ” which said that they did not want the President of the United States to visit Pittsburgh . The thing is , those Radical Leftists do not want the President to visit anywhere . Just as there are rabid Leftist Catholics ( not to mention the more mainstream Leftist Nancy Pelosi , Joe Biden , and the Kennedys ) and rabid Leftist Protestants , these also are rabid Leftists . Within the normative mainstream American Jewish community , “ Bend the Arc ” is a joke , off the charts . Their CEO started off as a sex-club “ dancer. ” C ’ mon ! As reported : “ Cotler , who identifies as queer , recounted how a lesbian couple invited her to their [ event ] after she did a table dance for them at what she refers to as a ‘ sex club. ’ ” Feh !\nSo this Leftist fringe group issues their statement — and the Fake News Left Media then falsely report that “ the Jews of Pittsburgh ” ( not “ some Jews ” ) do not want the President to visit . Consider these headlines — and they are a mere sampling :\n“ ‘ You Are Not Welcome ’ : Jewish Community Leaders Do Not Want President Trump To Come To Pittsburgh ” ( Salon )\n“ Pittsburgh Jewish Leaders Tell Trump To Stay Away Unless He Denounces White Nationalism ” ( NY Daily News )\n“ Trump ‘ Not Welcome ’ In Pittsburgh After Synagogue Shooting ” ( Al Jazeera )\n“ Pittsburgh Jewish Leaders Tell Trump To Denounce White Nationalism ” ( Reuters )\nAll those stories thereupon cite the same insignificant radical-fringe “ Bend the Arc ” statement . Honestly — if there still is such a thing as honesty — that is outright Fake News . I know the American Jewish community . I have been a Vice President of the Zionist Organization of America , a congregational rabbi for decades , sat for six years during this past decade on the Executive Committee of the Rabbinical Council of America , have sat on committees of Jewish Federations and Boards of Hillels , have a whole lifetime résumé in this area . My rabbinical colleagues and I were bristling all day , reading and hearing this Fake News . The rabbi of the temple where the murders happened , Rabbi Jeffrey Meyers , explicitly welcomed a visit by the President . To report such lies , at a time of such intense passion , is to stoke flames among the populace . It is not unfair to call such liars “ Enemies of the People . ”\nThey do it similarly to convince Americans of Color that this President hates them . He beams so proudly that he has helped reduce poverty and unemployment in the African-American community . Likewise , in the Latino and Greater Hispanic communities . It is a hallmark of his every speech . How compare him to Hitler , for G-d ’ s sakes ? Why sow social discord between and among races when the President , despite his classical Trumpian gaffes , actually takes so much pride in his being a President for all Americans , in a country where — in his trademark line — “ we all bleed the same red , white , and blue ” ? Why denigrate his outreach to Black Americans , whether via Kanye West and Jim Brown or by speaking to a Young Black Leadership Summit ? Why begin narrating his Presidency on Day One by reporting falsely , as Zeke Miller of Time magazine did , the lie that he had removed a bust of the Rev . Dr. Martin Luther King from the Oval Office ? Why publish falsehoods to sow discord among the Black and Latino communities — if not to aim cynically to peel away their votes — by trying falsely to report that he is a bigot who hates them ? Here is a man who was in the public eye , in the world ’ s media center in the heart of Manhattan , with a weekly network television show , building skyscrapers and hotels , golf courses and casinos — all bearing his name — and no stain of racism or bigotry of such sort ever got attached to him through all those decades in the limelight . Why cause enmity and divide the nation , disillusion African Americans and Latinos from recognizing that this President seeks their advancement alongside that of everyone else ? Only to sow civil discord , to promote tension and unrest in the name of advancing an agenda that assures greater television ratings , higher advertising dollars , and a change in the elected government chosen of The People , by The People , and for The People .\n3 . The Proof the Pudding : Tagging the Most Pro-Jewish President in American History as an Anti-Semite .\nSo it comes back to the Rosetta Stone — the way the Left Media falsely portrays this President ’ s relationship with one demographic , the Jews , demonstrating a pattern of Left Media mendacity aimed at sowing social discord throughout . Even before he was elected President , the Left Media was calling him an anti-Semite by clutching at straws to prove the false narrative . Just as they did by propping up “ Bend the Arc ” into a Fake News depiction as “ Jewish Leaders , ” they regularly dig up the most irrelevant and unrepresentative people from the Far Left who are JINOs— Jews In Name Only — as “ experts ” on Trump and anti-Semitism . It does not end . These are lies , damned lies , and more damned lies being perpetuated by enemies of the people . Just consider these facts about the Trump Administration and the Jews :\nThis is an anti-Semite ? If so , may G-d smite us with an abundance of such anti-Semites ! Although his daughter , Ivanka , and son-in-law Jared Kushner are Orthodox Jews — as are their children , his grandchildren — that family connection in itself is not determinative . After all , we are told that George Soros is a Jew , and most every Jew I know would gladly trade Soros for two anti-Semites and a neo-Nazi to be named later . Soros is a major opponent of Israel and secretly funds organizations that oppose critical Israel policies . But the demonstrated life record of President Trump , a lifetime of working closely with Jews , amicably and warmly , makes him someone whom Jews throughout the world appreciate deeply . Again — every survey and poll of Jews who actually live the Jewish observances , the kosher laws , the Sabbath , the Torah demonstrates that he is warmly regarded in that community .\nThe Fake News about Trump and Jews is the Rosetta Stone . Once one cracks that hidden code , everything else becomes clear . The Left Media indeed propound Fake News , lies , and falsehoods . They undertake to stoke anger among African Americans , among Latinos , among women . The People rely on them for the news , the truth — and , yes , for honest reporting when the President is wrong because The People benefit when they are told the truth , even when the truth is not pretty . But to depict him as an agent of Putin , as a man perpetrating treason , a hater ?\nThese are the lies that come only from Enemies of the People . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

    "400": "There is an essential read by Steve Sailer at Taki ’ s Magazine from a week ago which might well explain the cultural and political landscape better than anything else you ’ ve seen in recent vintage . It ’ s entitled “ A Half Century of Amnesia , ” and you should take the time to have a look .\nSailer makes several important points , which could very easily be lost to readers not courageous enough to wade through obvious , though perhaps politically incorrect , facts , in recognizing the current cultural atmosphere which has not only given us Donald Trump in the White House but an apparent brewing sea change in the culture which the academic and media-elite Left simply isn ’ t recognizing ( Caitlan Flanagan ’ s surprising piece on Jordan Peterson ’ s growing celebrity at the Atlantic notwithstanding ) . Chief among those is Sailer ’ s central point ; namely that the Left has declared war on straight American white people for decades — and there is a natural price to pay for that hostility .\nThat sounds like a wild accusation , and it certainly feels strange to levy it , but how can anyone disagree ? This is a season , after all , in which the New York Times has gone totally off the deep end — embracing as part of its editorial staff a stunning mediocrity of a writer named Sarah Jeong whose Twitter is a fountain of anti-white racism so dependable as to put half of Yellowstone to shame , and which not so long ago ran a piece in its sports section decrying The Unbearable Whiteness of Baseball , decrying the fact that Major League rosters contain a proportion of white players which conforms to the population as a whole .\nThis is , in case you ’ re not aware , the purported newspaper of record for the United States of America — and in its pages can be found practically daily expositions of virulent bigotry toward the nation ’ s majority population .\nAccording to Sailer , it ’ s idiocy to believe , as the Left does — and he quotes liberally from a quite educational Vox piece by Ezra Klein which outlines this belief — that ordinary white Americans will be told again and again by our betters in the Democrat Party that America , via mass immigration , is to be made a majority-minority country and that the “ privilege ” afforded to whites as the majority population will soon be stripped away and justifiably so , and no reaction should be expected . From Klein ’ s piece…\nSo here , then , is what we know : Even gentle , unconscious exposure to reminders that America is diversifying — and particularly to the idea that America is becoming a majority-minority nation — pushes whites toward more conservative policy opinions and more support of the Republican Party .\nUnderstand — Klein doesn ’ t write this as a warning to Democrats that pushing immigration policies fundamentally altering the demographics of America will be seen as a bad idea by the majority population of the country . Klein writes it more as a curiosity , or as an indictment of the “ bitter clingers ” out there who can ’ t get with the inevitable program .\nSailer , chuckling at Klein ’ s arrogance , notes how ridiculous it all is . How obvious that if you make manifest your intention to replace the current majority with a new one , that the current majority might find your plan objectionable ? He recalls that back after the bare-minimum Republican electoral win in 2000 he suggested the Republican Party merely needed to push its share of the white vote from 54 to 57 percent in the country in order to retake a solid majority of American voters ( this idea was opposed by the GOP establishment and then-president George W. Bush ’ s guru Karl Rove , who believed the key to the party ’ s success could be found in co-opting the Hispanic vote ) . Fast forward 16 years , and Donald Trump fulfilled Sailer ’ s prophecy by winning 58 percent of the white vote , a number which might very well be a low mark for future elections , on the way to the White House . Trump didn ’ t win the popular vote , you might argue , but he is in fact the president .\nThat victory is not evidence of some Republican strategy to radicalize race in America , mind you , despite what you might see from the crowd at MSNBC or the Nation . While some of Trump ’ s supporters might be a bit more aggressive in pushing a defense of traditional majority ( white , if you will ) American culture , what activates the President ’ s base of support is less some sort of white identitarian message than a reaction to the opposite which surges through today ’ s Democrat Party . Who ’ s the white Republican answer to Joy Reid on cable news , after all ?\nAnd by the by , Trump ’ s approval rate among blacks is a lot higher than that of his recent Republican predecessors , indicating all of this is less about race than is advertised .\nWhen DNC chairman Thomas Perez takes to the airwaves to tout the obviously intellectually-challenged Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as his party ’ s “ future ” despite her clear lack of facility with economics or civics and her combination of Venezuelan-style socialism with an ethnic appeal to non-white voters , and particularly when Ocasio-Cortez throws out the most obnoxious statements about how white upper-middle class soccer moms are “ not America anymore , ” it isn ’ t required for a single Republican to talk about race for white voters to understand the lay of the land .\nIf you want someone ’ s vote , you have to make them understand that you don ’ t hate them and you ’ re not out to get them . Isn ’ t that the lecture the GOP has received ad nauseam — and perhaps rightfully so — by black and Hispanic advocates ?\nWell ? Why wouldn ’ t that similarly apply to Democrats and white people ?\nParticularly given the narrative that America will soon transform itself from its 60-something-percent white population to majority-minority status . Talk enough about the coming Browning Of America , and that population will eventually believe it and act accordingly as they see their interests . This is mere human nature , after all . Anti-white triumphalism , as Sailer notes , is merely advertising of a threat to the collective interest of Americans of pallor and it ’ s bound to bring these uncomfortable subjects to the fore within that population .\nAnd what on earth makes anyone believe that a population constantly demonized as brutal and racist and whose achievements are assailed as the products of exploitation and violence would stand aside , allowing itself to be marginalized through immigration ? Should it not be fairly obvious that at some point those horrible white people in America would simply choose to put a stop to the nation ’ s open-borders policies which have transformed the country from immigrants being a five percent share of the population in the 1970s to a current 14 percent share ? Right or wrong , should anyone be surprised to see such a shift as Trump ’ s presidency has made manifest ?\nAnd while we ’ re at it , since when was it an immutable fact that America would have an ever-growing population of immigrants ? Our history is of ebb and flow where that ’ s concerned , and until the past 50 years the ebb and flow never fundamentally altered the racial balance of the country . Wasn ’ t it a bit presumptuous that current trends would continue forever without some degree of pushback ?\nThis surely all sounds horribly racist , to certain ears . But it isn ’ t intended that way — it ’ s simply an observation about human nature . Certainly Sarah Jeong ’ s presence at the Times editorial board will make that paper less popular among those readers whose ethnicities she has attacked , and those readers will surely show how unimpressed they are with the epithets thrown their way by their consumer decisions . How is one to believe electoral results will differ when the Left proceeds to double down on Jeong ’ s racism ? That ’ s precisely what happened when National Review ’ s David French addressed the Jeong matter — sanely — and was met with a semi-literate anti-white screed from Medium ’ s Ezinne Ukoha denying the entire existence of anti-white racism . Does anyone believe this kind of argumentation will be persuasive ?\nYou can ’ t insult a group of people repeatedly , aggressively , the way the Left in its mob mentality insists upon doing to the majority of America and not expect consequences . Those will come . And in its rampant enthusiasm the Left has apparently decided to take a swing at some 60-plus percent of the population — a decent chunk of which has heretofore been sympathetic to its policies .\nThat won ’ t continue when idiocy like intersectionality — white people are allowed to have an opinion only after people of other races have had their say , and only after going through a progression prioritizing the disabled over the abled , homosexual before straight , and transgendered before , er , gendered — or Critical Race Theory “ black people can ’ t be racist ” claptrap like that espoused by Ukoha is the order of the day on the Left . When it ’ s not acceptable to express concern about jihadist training camps teaching malnourished and abused kids to be school shooters because to do so implies bigotry against Muslims , while at the same time the NYT smart set castigates Mike Pence for his flyover-country Christianity and dubs him a threat to the peace therefrom , how could it be a surprise when ordinary white people , many of whom might well have voted for Barack Obama in what they thought was a show of good faith to the rest of America , simply don ’ t care anymore ?\nThe answer is it ’ s not a surprise . The answer is you ’ re going to get a growing # WalkAway movement .\nWe ’ re not so far from Labor Day , which is the traditional mark on the calendar when voters begin to pay attention to coming elections . You ’ ve no doubt heard plenty about a supposed Blue Wave in this fall ’ s midterms , and Democrats are counting lots of chickens which have not yet hatched . But don ’ t be surprised when you see that Blue Wave dissipate as Election Day nears across America — and particularly in districts where the white vote is dispositive .\nAs Andrew Breitbart said , politics is downstream from culture . But both culturally and politically , the Left in America has been on a determined attack against traditional white America . Millions of Americans — people of pallor , if you will — who hate even being defined by the color of their skin will nonetheless take up identity politics if they feel they ’ re pushed to do so because someone is calling them racists simply because of their ethnicity , and demanding they forfeit their economic and/or social status — status they may not even be satisfied with as is — accordingly . They will inevitably respond to this , and negatively .\nAnd if they do , the Democrats will have only themselves to blame for the results . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "401": "FBI Director James Comey is talking with the Senate Judiciary Committee about his bureau 's investigation of ties between the Trump campaign and Russia .\nAmong the highlights ? Comey 's indignant attacks on Edward Snowden and Wikileaks :\nComey differentiated between WikiLeaks , an `` important focus '' of investigations , and legitimate news sources . `` It crosses a line when it moves from being about educating a public intelligence porn , just pushing out information…just to damage the United States , '' later adding , `` There 's nothing that even smells journalist about some of this content . '' Comey said the focus of investigations would almost always fall on leakers during legitimate investigations .\nComey 's comments on Wikileaks call to mind CIA head Mike Pompeo 's attacks on the organization just a couple of weeks ago . `` We can no longer allow [ Julian ] Assange and his colleagues the latitude to use free speech values against us , '' Pompeo declared in a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies . `` To give them the space to crush us with misappropriated secrets is a perversion of what our great Constitution stands for . It ends now . ''\nLet 's be clear : No official should be in the business of defining journalism ( and thus implicitly sanctioning government action against whistleblowers and other leakers ) . But it 's especially hilarious when the head of the FBI , an agency that has a long history of patently illegal and typically ineffective subterfuge , gets on his high horse about what 's legit media and what 's not . In a four-year stretch , for instance , the FBI authorized criminal activity by confidential informants over 22,000 times . It 's especially dark , too , when the FBI director is serving a president who has gone above and beyond in singling out specific individuals ( such as Amazon 's Jeff Bezos , who owns The Washington Post ) , calling for the `` loosening '' of libel laws regarding public figures and elected officials , and generally declaring war on the press . That Donald Trump is publicly at odds with Comey over the latter 's refusal to recommend charges against Hillary Clinton only makes the spectacle even more bizarre .\nObviously , it 's too much to ask U.S. officials to embrace Wikileaks and other sources that reveal the inner workings of the government , but there 's no question that Wikileaks has forced transparency in ways that have greatly benefited the public . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "402": "In case you missed it , a video came out this week that makes it look like ABC News affirmatively protected billionaire alleged pedophile Jeffrey Epstein . This came on top of allegations from journalist Ronan Farrow that NBC News killed his reporting on alleged rapist Harvey Weinstein to protect their own in-house sexual abuser , morning anchor Matt Lauer . In case anyone ’ s still wondering why people don ’ t trust the press , this is a pretty good place to start .\nAmy Robach , anchor at ABC , was caught on the recording saying that , under pressure from the British royal family , ABC executives killed her story that would have exposed sex offender Epstein :\n“ I ’ ve had the story for three years , ” Robach said . “ I ’ ve had this interview with Virginia Roberts . We would not put it on the air . First of all , I was told , ‘ Who ’ s Jeffrey Epstein ? No one knows who that is . This is a stupid story. ’ Then the palace found out we had her whole allegations about Prince Andrew and threatened us a million different ways . We were so afraid we wouldn ’ t be able to interview Kate and Will that we — that also quashed the story . And then Alan Dershowitz was also implicated in it because of the planes. ” ( RELATED : NBC , ABC And CBS Appear To Have Run Cover For World ’ s Most Powerful Rape Rings )\n“ ( Roberts ) told me everything . She had pictures . She had everything . She was in hiding for 12 years . We convinced her to come out . We convinced her to talk to us . It was unbelievable what we had . ( Bill ) Clinton . We had everything . I tried for three years to get it on , to no avail , and now it ’ s all coming out . And it ’ s , like , these ‘ new revelations , ’ and I freaking had all of it . I am so pissed right now . … What we had was unreal . ”\nThe story that ABC News told Robach was too “ stupid ” to cover was both appalling and important . Epstein , an extremely wealthy money manager with close relations to many of the top establishment figures in our country — most notably Bill and Hillary Clinton — had allegedly sexually abused scores of underage girls . He was indicted for it in 2007 . However , with assistance from top-flight lawyers such as Ken Starr , Jay Lefkowitz and Alan Dershowitz , Epstein negotiated an insanely light 13-month sentence with former U.S. Attorney and later Trump Labor Secretary Alex Acosta .\nThe Epstein case resonates as a shining example of the growing chasm between our society ’ s elites and everyone else . If the super wealthy and super connected can even get away with raping young girls with almost no punishment , our system is beyond broken .\nAfter the footage came out , Robach released a statement , presumably at ABC ’ s request , saying her past commentary was “ a private moment of frustration. ” ABC said they didn ’ t run the interview because they “ could not obtain sufficient corroborating evidence to meet ABC ’ s editorial standards about her allegations . ”\nABC ’ s claims that the story didn ’ t run because of a lack of “ corroborating evidence ” are hard to accept after the same network chose to run outlandish and completely uncorroborated reports about Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh , peddled at the time by now disgraced Democratic activist and lawyer Michael Avenatti . There ’ s no explanation for such disparate treatment besides pure bias .\nActually , there is one further explanation : politically partisan bias . Avenatti ’ s claims were made against Kavanaugh , a Republican . The claims against Epstein potentially implicated former President Bill Clinton . ABC killed the story when Hillary Clinton was running for president . ABC ’ s lead news anchor is George Stephanopoulos , Bill Clinton ’ s former staffer .

    "403": "In all of the media ’ s blather about bipartisanship , it never acknowledges the Democratic radicalism that makes any national unity impossible . No sooner had Trump finished the State of the Union Address — a speech that could have been delivered by any Democrat before the radicalism of the 1960s and 1970s seeped into the party — than CNN was throwing a wet blanket on it . “ There will be Democrats offended by the speech , ” intoned Jake Tapper . “ He was selling sweet candy with poison in it , ” chipped in Van Jones .\nWhat is the sound of one aisle clapping at the most basic and blameless expressions of nationalism , the nationalism that every functioning country on earth observes ? Americans heard it Tuesday night . The Democrats couldn ’ t clap for the flag or fighting gangs ( that elicited a groan from some of them ) . It couldn ’ t clap for the national anthem , secure borders , religious liberty , even vocational training . It saw poison everywhere , though they did perk up at Trump ’ s mention of second chances for criminals .\nThe Democrats have become the foreigners first party . Notice that one of the two official Democratic responses was in Spanish . The other one was delivered by Rep. Joe Kennedy III , whose digressions about “ transgenderism ” would have even confused his forbears . He too broke into a little Spanish during his response , before endorsing the open borders anarchism of La Raza . He approvingly quoted illegal immigrants who promised to “ tear down ” any future walls .\nTrump ’ s speech contained few ideological edges . But Tapper , a former Democratic staffer , saw parts of the speech as “ holding up a fist. ” Other commentators , desperate to find something to attack in the speech , pronounced it “ flat ” and questioned its “ cadence. ” They liked that he larded it with a rainbow of “ inspirational stories , ” but turned their noses up at its policy ambitions , even though many of them ( paid family leave and amnesty for Dreamers ) represented substantial concessions to the Democrats .\nBefore the Democrats took their McGovernite turn , they would have agreed with almost everything in Trump ’ s speech and would have stood for much of it . Now it is a party of stale and geriatric radicalism . ( Even Joe Kennedy III sounded like a young old fogey , delivering a speech that could have been written by George McGovern and Bernie Sanders . ) And so the Democrats sulked through much of the speech . They fiddled with their phones and rolled their eyes even at the most banal lines . The black caucus slouched through Trump ’ s tribute to historic levels of black employment .\nBefore the speech , CNN treated the boycotting Democrats gingerly and sympathetically , even raising the question of whether mere attendance constituted “ normalizing ” Trump . It didn ’ t treat those Democrats as extreme but worthy of a serious hearing .\nWhen not debating that matter solemnly , CNN indulged in some leering speculation about the Trump marriage . One “ correspondent ” popped up before the speech started to wonder if Melania ’ s white attire was a form of protest against her husband . Much was made of Melania traveling “ separately ” to the speech . That she was hosting a pre-speech reception with Pence ’ s wife didn ’ t suffice as an explanation . “ They are traveling separately on multiple fronts , ” one of the anchors asserted . So much for the media ’ s old rules about the tastelessness of probing presidential families . It is open season on the Trumps . All of the insinuating comments about Melania were couched in faux-respectful language ( she is more popular than her husband , Wolf Blitzer hastened to add , as if that gave a certain dignity to the otherwise gossipy tone of the segment ) , but I doubt she found any of it flattering .\nBut the most forlorn attendee was Joe Manchin , who spent much of the speech standing alone . Afterwards , he noted the rudeness of his fellow Democrats . That didn ’ t go over well at CNN . Van Jones scoffed at Manchin ’ s comment . Anderson Cooper didn ’ t find the rudeness of the Democrats noteworthy either . The best one guest could muster as an explanation for Manchin ’ s comment was that Trump avoided “ red meat ” in the speech . But soon enough they were back to chiding him for “ alienating ” Democrats .\nAvoiding that is an impossible task , given that the Democrats find their own country ’ s flag alienating . As the postmortem wore on , it began to dawn on CNN ’ s liberal commentariat that its initial reaction to the speech was less positive than that of the channel ’ s own viewers . A CNN instant poll showed that most viewers approved of the speech . But David Axelrod took hope in tomorrow ’ s “ tweets ” and John King wondered about the “ shelf-life ” of Trump ’ s address . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

Those are reported with a one-week lag . The decline suggests that some who lost their jobs have been rehired or found new work .\nThe largest increases in initial claims for the week ending May 16 were in California , Washington , and New York . The largest decrease in claims was in Georgia , New Jersey , Kentucky , Louisiana , and Pennsylvania .\nThe federal government has been shipping in an extra $ 600 a week to state unemployment benefits , making the program much more generous . Many workers can now earn more on unemployment than they did when they had a job .

That figure is likely to rise when May ’ s data is reported next week .\nIn addition to claims for regular unemployment benefits , the government now offers Pandeemic Unemployment Assistance to business owners , self-employed , gig-workers , and independent contractors who would not ordinarily qualify for unemployment benefits .

    "405": "In the states and abroad , policymakers and commentators are salivating over the opportunity to regulate social media content . It is easy to understand why governments might want to have more influence on social media platforms . But the legacy media 's consistent push for more controls on platforms like Facebook and Twitter has been less scrutinized . There is a ███ for this consilience : these policies can ultimately serve as a government-granted privilege that favored media firms use to get an edge over their competition .\nIt may sound a little roundabout . It does n't take a short-sighted partisan to have serious problems with a lot of social media practices . For instance , tech platforms have collaborated , willingly or not , with governments in surveillance and social conditioning campaigns . Then there 's the spectral but speculated upon creation of `` shadow profiles '' that are only discernable through their algorithmic residue .\nBut do n't be fooled : Some parties who trot out these more reasonable pretexts for enhanced tech scrutiny do so for opportunistic reasons .\nConsider the recent campaign by media outfits in the United Kingdom to crack down on social media platforms .\nIn early September , the leaders of some of the top media conglomerates across the pond—including the BBC , Sky , ITV , and Channel 4—wrote a strong letter to The Sunday Telegraph urging the government to intervene to counteract `` all potential online harms , many of which are exacerbated by social media . ''\nThere are a variety of proposals on the table , and these media leaders specifically suggested that a government oversight board could be created to monitor and manage social media platforms . But whatever the final form , it is clear to them that Something Must Be Done . After all , they `` do not think it is realistic or appropriate to expect internet and social media companies to make all the judgment calls about what content is and is not acceptable , without any independent oversight . ''\nSound ironic ? The same media companies who would rightly howl at the suggestion that a government oversee their `` judgement calls about what content is and is not acceptable '' —A.K.A . delivering news—self-righteously call to impose these rules on a competing industry without a second thought . They may cloak their self-interested campaign in the rhetoric of `` safety , '' but so do opponents of the free press .\nIt is no secret that the rise of social media has caught many in the traditional media industry flatfooted . The unfortunate demise of many austere news houses is cliché to the point of being a frequent presidential punching bag , and the digitization of information has absolutely driven that trend . Adding insult to injury , the advertising infrastructure that used to prop up traditional journalism has likewise become `` optimized , '' prompting journalists ' futures to be driven by the algorithmic whims of a perhaps too easily bamboozled public . I 'd be mad about this state of affairs , too .\nBut this does not justify privilege-seeking . It is easy to see how enhanced government control of the means of information distribution could have the happy effect of shoring up the positions of traditional media outlets . Any kind of controls that slow down the rate of information distribution could do this . Even better—the oversight board could be staffed by current or former members of the established press . After all , who better than they to determine what content is in the public interest ? And perhaps it just so happens that their current or former institutions happen to be the most trustworthy , and therefore the most often allowed on social media platforms… .\nSociety is always made worse off overall when specific industries are protected by the government . But this state of affairs is all the more frightening when the relevant industry concerns a factor so vital to governance as delivering the truth .\nThe situation is similar in the United States , as last week 's spectacle on Capitol Hill suggests . Here , as in the United Kingdom , many media outlets harbor grudges against social media platforms for their effects on the news industry and public opinion .\nBut there are key institutional differences that change the calculus .\nThe freedom of speech is a constitutionally protected right in America , but not in the U.K . Even though social media platforms are private companies , the cultural respect of free speech is jealously guarded here , and that influences people 's opinions on proper policy responses . Perhaps the cultural antibodies against violations of free speech are simply weaker in the U.K. Alternatively , perhaps Americans will misdirect our love of free speech into supporting public utility regulations on social media platforms that also violate the speech rights of social media platforms .\nAt the end of the day , media companies—vaunted though their profession may be in some circles—are still companies . And many of them are very big and very powerful . Some who call for social media oversight may truly have earnest motives . But surely all of them do not , and we should not allow the halo of `` the press '' to cloud our scrutiny of what may be simply an ugly business move . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

Instead , the winner will be `` who it is that gives us hope that the best days are ahead of us , '' Perry said .\nPerry cited the questions that have been raised over foreign donations to the Clinton family 's charitable foundation , and Hillary Clinton 's handling of the Benghazi attack while she was secretary of state .\n`` I ca n't get past all the drama we see with the Clintons , '' Perry said .\nPerry did n't step all the way in the race , as Texas Senator Ted Cruz did on Monday . He did say that if he were president , he would put an end to the days of big government .\n`` The heavy hand of government works against you , '' Perry said . `` It kills jobs all too often . ''\nSounding familiar Republican themes , Perry said he supports lifting the U.S. ban on most crude oil exports , and he wants to secure the U.S. border with Mexico as a prelude to comprehensive immigration reform . He also said TransCanada Corp 's Keystone XL pipeline to bring more Canadian crude to the U.S. Gulf Coast should be approved .\n`` I would get North America in the worldwide energy business in a big way , '' Perry said . `` I think it is a major error we are making not allowing our crude to be used .

    "407": "The idea of a “ decade in review ” article at the end of 2019 is a bit of “ fake news. ” Technically , the current decade does not end until December 31 , 2020 .\nIn that spirit , it is worth looking back at the past ten years through the “ fake news ” lens . These were years in which the mainstream media used false allegations and biased reporting to suppress conservative voices ; they were also the first years in which , thanks to Andrew Breitbart , we began to resist them .\n2010 : Tea Party “ N-word. ” The media ’ s claimed , based on false allegations by House Democrats , that Tea Party protesters called civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis ( D-GA ) the “ n-word ” at a demonstration on Capitol Hill against Obamacare . Andrew Breitbart offered $ 10,000 , then $ 100,000 to the United Negro College Fund if anyone could provide video proving the allegation . No one ever did , but the fake news tarnished the Tea Party — permanently .\n2011 : Sarah Palin and Tucson shooting . The media blamed former Alaska Gov . Sarah Palin for inciting a mass shooting in Tucson , Arizona because her PAC used crosshairs in an ad identifying “ targeted ” congressional districts , including that of wounded Rep. Gabrielle Giffords ( D-AZ ) . The shooter turned out to be insane . In other fake news , media blamed Tea Party Republicans for the debt limit showdown , though many ultimately would vote to raise it .\n2012 : Mitt Romney ’ s taxes , and Benghazi . The media played up sensational accusations that GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney had killed a former employee ’ s wife , or failed to pay taxes . These were all untrue — a fact later justified by former Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D-NV ) , who noted with satisfaction that Romney had lost . The second presidential debate featured a CNN moderator intervening to defend Obama ’ s lies about Benghazi .\n2013 : Obamacare collapse . The media mocked and attacked Republicans after Sen. Ted Cruz ( R-TX ) used a “ talking filibuster ” to shut the government down ahead of the imminent launch of Obamacare . When Obamacare finally opened , however , the federal website did not work ; one state ’ s insurance exchange collapsed and never recovered . In subsequent years , households were shocked by rising premiums and unaffordably high deductibles .\n2014 : “ Hands up , don ’ t shoot. ” The media reported — and celebrated — the infamously false claim that black teenager Michael Brown had been shot in the back while attempting to surrender to police ; in fact he had grabbed an officer ’ s gun and was charging him when he was shot in self-defense . That fake news story damaged race relations and disrupted policing in urban neighborhoods — ironically , making black Americans more unsafe .\n2015 : Trump remarks on Mexicans and Muslims . In what would become the new template for coverage of Donald Trump , the media claimed that he had called all Mexican immigrants “ rapists ” in his campaign launch speech , though he had clearly attempted to distinguish between criminals and “ good people. ” His later call for a “ Muslim ban , ” likewise , was a response to Islamic terror , not an expression of some innate religious prejudice .\n2016 : Russian intervention in the election . When Trump joked at a press conference , “ Russia , if you ’ re listening , I hope you ’ re able to find the 30,000 e-mails that are missing , ” the media — and the Obama administration — took that as evidence that he was colluding with Russian attempts to interfere in the election . That led to surveillance of the Trump campaign and to media leaks that planted the seeds of the conspiracy theory that still haunts us to this day .\n2017 : Charlottesville “ very fine people ” hoax . President Trump condemned violence on all sides ; specifically condemned racism ; then noted that there were “ very fine people ” among non-violent protesters on both sides of the issue of the removal of a Confederate statue , adding : “ I ’ m not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists , because they should be condemned totally. ” The media later said that he had called neo-Nazis “ very fine people . ”\n2018 : “ Kids in cages. ” In 2014 , ███ broke the story that thousands of illegal alien kids were suddenly swamping the border . The media covered the story , but largely ignored that Obama had built chain-link fences in temporary holding facilities . By 2018 , thy claimed Trump was putting “ kids in cages ” by enforcing existing laws . Latee , the media spread unsubstantiated sexual allegations against Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanagh .\n2019 : Ukraine phone call and impeachment . The Democrats , relying on a second- or third-hand complaint from a so-called “ whistleblower , ” claimed that president Trump tried to “ solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election. ” Trump released the rough “ transcript ” of the call , showing he had done nothing of the sort . The Democrats pressed ahead with impeachment , using the media to publish selective leaks of closed-door testimony .\nNo doubt 2020 will bring more fake news , with an impeachment trial and a presidential election looming — against the backdrop of the most successful economy in American history .\nWhat Andrew Breitbart called the “ Democrat-Media Complex ” will be fighting hard , assisted by the censorship of tech giants in Silicon Valley .\nHowever , thanks to him , the American people still have alternative media through which to find the truth , to fight back , and to win .\nJoel B.

    "408": "As a dirty rotten # NeverTrump traitor , I realize my opinion doesn ’ t count for much , but I think it ’ s a mistake for President Trump to be tweeting all the time . Sure , it helped get him elected , but is it really helping him govern ? His off-the-cuff style can be fun , and I can ’ t help but enjoy the way he drives lefties out of the tattered remnants of their minds , but spewing out every little thing that annoys him about whatever he ’ s watching on cable news… It just seems like a bad idea in the long run .\nThat said , he has every right to do it , and he ’ s under no obligation to listen to anybody he doesn ’ t want to . Twitter allows users to mute or block any other user , at any time and for any reason . You can say whatever you want , but that doesn ’ t oblige anybody else to listen .\nThat ’ s not enough for some people , though , because Hillary lost and it isn ’ t fair and they will not be ignored . Charlie Savage , NYT :\nLawyers for Twitter users blocked by President Trump after they criticized or mocked him are asking him to reverse the moves , arguing that the Constitution bars him from blocking people on the social media service .\nThe request raises novel legal issues stemming from Mr. Trump ’ s use of his Twitter account , @ realDonaldTrump , to make statements about public policy…\nThe blocked Twitter users are represented by the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University , whose executive director , Jameel Jaffer , said in a statement that Mr. Trump did not have a right to exclude his critics from engaging with his posts…\nOne of the Twitter users the letter said Mr. Trump had blocked is Holly O ’ Reilly , whose account is @ AynRandPaulRyan .\nAfter reading this , I became curious about the sort of person who would threaten to sue the President of the United States for blocking her on Twitter .

Because think about it , the president also has the authority under Article II [ of the Constitution ] to pardon people , but we don ’ t say for example that the president can ’ t pardon a certain person because he has a corrupt intent , he likes the guy he ’ s known him for a long time so therefore he can ’ t pardon him . ”\n“ The pardon power like the power to head the investigative , or the rest of the executive branch like the FBI , like the DOJ is a plenary discretionary authority of the president .

    "410": "Even President Trump ’ s supporters do not fully realize the job he has done . As I have written in the past , during the course of a wonderful rabbinic career that has given me so much personal satisfaction and fulfillment and that hopefully has touched the lives of my flocks , I once endured the Twilight Zone interlude of being rabbi of one of the worst Nightmare Congregations in America . ( Two of my dearest friends , both Christian pastors , have enlightened me that the experience was not unique , and both pointed me to an extraordinary book , Clergy Killers , that lays out the despicable phenomenon of Houses of G-d of all faiths where outlier ego-driven laity can destroy spiritual harmony as they superimpose their personal social pathologies on everyone in their church , temple , or synagogue . ) During that brief thirty-month journey in the Twilight Zone , there was a coterie of only a dozen jerks out to sabotage my every effort despite the warm support and even deep love I enjoyed among the vast majority of that congregation of 250 or so people . But the jerks comprised the inner circle , the “ Board of Directors , ” comprised of some wonderful people out-shouted by determined ego-driven laity who knew so very little about conducting a religious community but a great deal about internal political manipulations and striving for crumbs of vainglory .\nI recount this brief nightmare — and thank G-d Almig-ty it was only a passing phase , a blip in a pulpit career of more than a quarter century — because I therefore appreciate more deeply from that personal experience what President Trump has accomplished against all odds . As a rabbi , I constantly was being harassed by the Gang of Miscreants who were determined to stop my every religious and spiritual initiative . I tried to bring in a marvelous young married couple as Youth Directors , and the Board produced a false budget that showed we could not afford it . Inasmuch as I had spent more than a decade as a trained high-stakes civil litigation attorney , I had more experience than do most rabbis in analyzing a complex budget . It took me days to pierce through the errors and to educate enough sympathetic Board members so that we indeed hired that couple — with plenty of money to spare — but there was grief to endure . There was the case of the person who had harassed two women , but who was very well inter-connected with the powers in charge , and I had to decide whether I make the issue of his removal a central crusade of my rabbinate . I did make it so , and I won , but it came at a severe personal cost that I still never have regretted . If a rabbi will not stand for zero tolerance , who will ? There was the case of the Board officer who entered my office and , in my presence , viciously swiped his arm across my desk and sent everything flying : my stacks of papers , my business cards , my holy books . Indeed , each and every sabotage , each and every effort to provoke me , disrupted my longer-term programs . I still accomplished many of my goals , and sixty of the 150 congregational households followed me when I departed from that place and started a new shul , but I often had to delay programs , reduce projects , reorient my schedule , even reschedule important pastoral-care sessions to deal with the daily attacks , investigations , and other harassments . During those years , I uncharacteristically did very little outside writing because something had to give time-wise .\nI am going to assume , dollars to donuts , that several of this column ’ s readers have encountered something similar . Not necessarily at a church or temple , but maybe at a law firm or an accounting firm , a medical department at a hospital , a standard office setting . The internecine petty sabotage of office politics where mediocrities who never achieve anything great choose to live to sabotage those who surpass them . These are the themes of so many of Ayn Rand ’ s greatest novels : The Fountainhead , Atlas Shrugged , We the Living — where mediocrities who themselves never could build , design , or even conceptualize a great edifice devote their efforts to tearing down a great architect , where incompetents who can not run a railroad or a steel mill do all they can to sabotage the successes and achievements of those who can .\nThis is what President Trump has been dealing with from the day he walked into the Presidency . The Mediacracy ’ s mediocrities set out to destroy him from Day One . The lies began immediately : He is an anti-Semite . Lie . He took a bust of Rev . Dr. King out of the oval office . Lie . He is a White supremacist . Lie .\nNo sooner was he at work than the hordes descended on his spokesman , Sean Spicer . Later they would throw the next spokesperson and her family out of a restaurant . And that evil Mueller Inquisition . One of these days , between tomorrow and the end of Mr. Trump ’ s second term in six years , we will see that Mr. Trump did not collude with Putin , but that Inquisition has taken so much air out of his every day . The President does not lay it out for us , but he surely needs to meet with his lawyers , deal with strategy over whether to give a deposition ( Don ’ t You Dare , Mr . President ! ) , review a gazillion documents . He has to watch friends and supporters get harassed with midnight SWAT raids , thrown into prison over nonsense because every single human being can accidentally have an innocent memory lapse or misstate a fact when subjected to hours of trick questions .\nFrankly , I don ’ t know how he has achieved so much so fast . ISIS was spreading into a caliphate , and he finished them . North Korea was launching ballistic missiles , and he stopped it , even getting the Doughboy to return the remains of American heroes who had fallen there half a century earlier . He got back that pastor from Turkey . He has imposed brutal sanctions on Putin and started arming Ukraine after Obama kowtowed to Putin and ended our promised missile defenses that we were supposed to provide Poland and the Czech Republic . He ended our insane cash flow to terrorists of the Palestine Authority , which was using your and my millions to finance the families of convicted murderers , bombers , and other terrorists while producing schoolbooks that teach eternal hate to children . He turned America from an energy net-importing country to net-exporting country . He reversed the stagnancy of the Obama Wasted Decade ’ s dead economy and made it robust . The tax cuts . Manufacturing in the Rust Belt that was deemed hopelessly dead has revived . Our aluminum and steel industries are back . Veterans have new medical choices for care . The Obamacare tax penalty is dead . An unprecedented rush of new conservative federal judges have assumed their lifetime bench appointments in the federal district and appellate circuit courts , with another 54 now nominated and proceeding through The Resistance . He has wiped out scores of Obama regulations that stagnated the economy and our lives , even as he got us out of the Obama Iran Giveaway , the Paris Climate Accord that imposed on America but not on China , India , or anyone else . He got us out of the TPP and renegotiated the disastrous NAFTA . And oh how valiantly he has fought to prop up our southern border and to stop the flow of opioids , human trafficking , and gang thugs and terrorists .\nThrough all this he has had to deal with The Resistance , false charges of Russian collusion from people who themselves colluded with Russians , an Obama-and-Clinton stacked Ninth Circuit court of appeals , a murder of crows at CBS , NBC , ABC , MSNBC , CNN , the NYT , and WaPo that will not give him a chance . They attack everything he does , everything he says . One week they make an Omarosa their hero . The next week Avenatti — until he gets charged with battering a woman . The pole dancer whose main legal accomplishment so far has been to lose lawsuits against the President and get stuck with paying the President ’ s attorneys ’ fees in the six figures . One week it is a Michael Cohen who , when not giving the media the anti-Trump quotes that make them salivate , is being imprisoned for one crime or another , with a rap sheet that goes to taxi medallions . Another week a lie that the President suborned perjury . Meanwhile , every time he gets a physical exam that results in a doctor innocently announcing that the President is in good health , the same Mediacracy mediocrities set about to destroy the doctor . Abort them !\nIt is amazing that this President has achieved so much so soon . I know from my Twilight Zone congregation of thirty months what it was like trying to get a job done when mediocrities set up daily obstacles , investigations , and demanded endless reports . But that is “ small potatoes ” compared to turning around the United States and the course of our country ’ s history . It is amazing that he has achieved so much .\nThey mock his wife . Go ahead and mock an African-American accent the way that Jimmy Kimmel has done in blackface . Go ahead and mock a Hispanic accent , as once was permitted in the days of Dick Tracy and Go-Go Gomez , or Bill Dana and Jose Jimenez , or The Frito Bandito . You can ’ t do that anymore — and , OK , fine . Let us indeed be copacetic with respecting cultures and accents . But Chelsea Handler may mock Melania Trump ’ s accent , even though Melania is twenty times smarter than a Chelsea Handler and speaks more languages than Handler even knows exist . Then they analyze Melania ’ s clothes , and they publish page-one stories about every outfit ’ s “ hidden message ” — invariably that she is about to ask for a divorce . Or where is she ? Why is she hiding ? They hound her ; who can blame her for staying out of their glare for a few days or weeks ? Let her recuperate from surgery . So then they go after his son . Then after his daughter , then after his son-in-law . They even go after the tall-but-still little kid when poor Barron falls asleep or closes his eyes . They write that he is autistic . Who goes after kids like that in a civil society ? They are vicious .\nLet us be forthright : Here is the President ’ s one flaw , and Chris Christie has been spot-on , though self-serving , through his book tour . Donald Trump came to Washington . D.C. too cockamamie-sure that he knows everything about everything and therefore can navigate anything on his own . He took on a chief of staff and a press spokesman blithely because , oh , may as well . He picked cabinet members based on considerations — and I do get it — as to what would satisfy the Mediacracy wolves ’ thirst for blood . So he owed Jeff Sessions eternal gratitude — he really did — for being the only United States Senator to back him during the rough-and-tumble GOP primaries , and made him his Attorney General . He put Rex Tillerson in charge of State because Tillerson had carved a phenomenal career in dealing effectively with the Russians including Putin on energy issues . He put Mad Dog in charge of defense because the name sounded good , and Gen. Mattis seemed the guy . In all these , Mr. Trump failed to appreciate that , no , you can not be maximally effective as President without help you can count on — help that is the best of the best , and that is the most loyal of the loyal , and people who share precisely your vision , not aiming to advance their own .\nHis great mistake was that — quite the opposite of his public persona — he was too nice a guy , too willing to make others happy and play to others ’ expectations . So he put faith in Paul Ryan to be an improvement over John Boehner , and that was a mistake . He brought in Reince Priebus , a wonderful guy , and Sean Spicer — but those jobs were above their pay grades ; he should have begun with Gen. John Kelly . Omarosa should have been made his Secretary of TV Shows and stationed in Bosnia . Mike Pompeo should have been his Secretary of State from Day One . John Bolton belonged on the inside from the outset . Nikki Haley proved a shockingly great United Nations ambassador , but he blew it with the A-G . It should have been Chris Christie , or the ever-tongue-slipping Rudy Giuliani , Joe diGenova , or even the best we have had in years , Michael Mukasey . That one last botch — picking the wrong Attorney-General — will be recorded in history as his worst mistake . It doomed so much of his first term . Look how great Eric Holder was for Obama , followed equally by Loretta Lynch . Each knew how an A-G with guts and fortitude , bold and brash , fast and furious , on the tarmac and off the tarmac , can make or break so much of a President ’ s agenda . Indeed , that is why John Kennedy decided that “ Gee , nepotism may look bad , but I want my brother in that role . ”\nDonald Trump came in with no prior legislative experience . If he had known then what he finally has learned now , he would have shoved that border wall down Ryan ’ s throat , and he would have gotten it . If he had had the right A-G , he would have crafted his entry ban a bit more cleverly , and each of his subsequent Ninth Circuit debacles would have been more elegantly situated for Supreme Court review . Indeed , if he had me— and I am utterly not qualified , nor would I want it because I like being a rabbi and law professor , and I hate participatory politics — but if he had had even me , I would have advised him that , every single time he issues a new Executive Order , he should counter-intuitively have the pro-Trump Texas or Louisiana Attorney General race immediately to the Fifth Circuit to attack him and his Executive Order… so that the first court that rules with a national injunction would be the pro-Trump , pro-conservative Fifth Circuit . Race to the Fifth before the Left gets to the Ninth . That would have changed the whole dynamic on everything from the Keystone XL Pipeline to the various issues on the southern border .\nWe now enter the era of the Democrat House investigations . They want his taxes ? Well , America wants Adam Schiff ’ s taxes . And Nancy Pelosi ’ s taxes . And the taxes not only of Dianne Feinstein and Maxine Waters but also of their husbands who have become very , very rich . Schiff and the other Democrat House committees are going to demand for the next two years . That is not “ oversight. ” We all have been employed or have employed others — or both . Oversight is when an overseer assures that the underling is coming to work on time , not stealing from the petty cash , doing an honest day ’ s work for an honest day ’ s dollar , not dawdling all day playing solitaire on the computer or scaring off the customers or disconnecting phone callers . That is oversight . By contrast , oversight is not persecuting someone — demanding his taxes , his kids ’ taxes , trying to drive him crazy and tie him up with sabotage all day every day to prevent him from getting his work done .\nAs these next two years unfold , I hope that gutless GOP Senate committees , if only to save their own hides , start subpoenaing every Clinton thing they can think of : Clinton Foundation , Clinton speaking fees and secret speeches , back to Benghazi , back to the 33,000 yoga and wedding-dress emails . Investigate who lied to the Senate Judiciary Committee during the Kavanaugh hearings and make them roommates with Manafort and Cohen . Get Lois Lerner back ; we miss her . Investigate Comey and all his crew : Macabre McCabe , Strzok , Page . Investigate that Obama CIA director , John Brennan , who voted for Gus Hall , the Communist candidate for President . ( Did we actually just have a CIA director who had voted for a pro-Soviet Communist President of America ? And that guy is accusing others of treason and collusion with the Russians ? ) And , taking a cue from Mueller , just name a Special Investigator to investigate “ the Clintons ” — with the proviso that he or she is authorized to follow the trail wherever it leads . It will lead everywhere . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "411": "Former DOJ official David Kris was picked Friday to oversee the FBI ’ s reforms of its surveillance procedures in the wake of a damning inspector general ’ s report .\nKris was an ardent defender of the FBI ’ s surveillance of Carter Page . He was also a vocal critic of Republicans who suggested the FBI misled the surveillance court in its applications to wiretap Page .\nIn one essay , Kris endorsed a suggestion that Rep. Devin Nunes should face obstruction of justice charges .\nNunes told ███ News Foundation the choice of Kris is “ shocking and inexplicable . ”\nA former Justice Department official picked Friday to oversee the FBI ’ s reforms of its surveillance procedures in the wake of a damning inspector general ’ s report was one of the many pundits during the Russia probe to defend the bureau ’ s surveillance of Trump campaign aide Carter Page .\nDavid S. Kris , a former assistant attorney general for national security , was also an outspoken critic of Rep. Devin Nunes and other congressional Republicans who accused the FBI of misleading the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ( FISC ) in applications to wiretap Page .\nAn inspector general ’ s ( IG ) report released Dec. 9 , 2019 , largely vindicated Republicans and Page . The report identified 17 errors and omissions the FBI made in its four applications to surveil Page . The IG also said the FBI was unable to corroborate allegations that Page was a Russian agent .\nJudge James E. Boasberg , who presides over the FISC , tapped Kris serve as amicus curiae for a review of the FBI ’ s handling of the Page surveillance warrants . In that role , Kris will “ assist ” the FISC in assessing the FBI ’ s implementation of a series of reforms to address the problems uncovered in the IG report .\nNunes and Page both panned the choice of Kris given his past commentary defending the FBI .\n“ It ’ s hard to imagine a worse person the FISC could have chosen outside Comey , McCabe , or Schiff , ” Nunes , the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee , told ███ News Foundation .\nPage also weighed in on Kris ’ s selection to oversee the FBI ’ s reforms .\n“ If there were any hope for the system fixing this FISA mess , it extinguished with David Kris ’ appointment , ” he told The DCNF .\n“ Nobody trying to fix the rampant abuse and coverup plaguing the entire FISA process would have picked Kris , ” continued Page , who called Kris a “ longtime FISA apologist . ”\n“ Instead , you appoint Kris for only one reason : you don ’ t want the system fixed . You just want it to look like you do . ”\nKris , who served at the Justice Department from 2009 to 2011 , asserted in his writings during the Trump-Russia probe that Republicans had “ falsely accused ” the FBI of misleading the FISC in its wiretap applications .\nHe also accepted the FBI ’ s assertion that there was probable cause to believe that Page was a foreign agent of Russia — an allegation that was all but debunked by the special counsel ’ s report and the inspector general ’ s report .\n“ It ’ s disturbing that Page met that legal standard and that there was probable cause to conclude he was a Russian agent , ” Kris wrote in an essay March 1 , 2018 , at Lawfare , a blog operated by the Brookings Institution .\nKris ’ s assessment — which echoed that of many Democrats and liberals in the media — accepted the FBI ’ s claim at face value that Page was a Russian asset . The FBI made the assertion in four applications to the FISC to wiretap Page . The basis for the allegation was the Democrat-funded Steele dossier .\nThe Justice Department inspector general ’ s report offered a brutal rebuke of the FBI ’ s surveillance of Page . It also offered a scathing portrait of Christopher Steele , the former British spy who wrote the dossier .\nThe IG report said the FBI withheld information regarding Page , a former Naval officer , that undercut the idea that he was a Russian agent . FBI agents also failed to disclose information that raised questions about Steele ’ s credibility and reliability .\nThe FBI failed to inform the FISC that one of Steele ’ s main dossier sources told agents in January 2017 that Steele misrepresented and exaggerated information in the dossier , including about Page . ( RELATED : Steele Dossier Was ‘ Central And Essential ’ To FBI ’ s Decision To Obtain Carter Page FISA )\nThe IG report said FBI agents inaccurately stated in the FISA applications that Steele had provided information in the past that the bureau used in indictments and search warrants . The report said the claim was inaccurate , and that Steele ’ s associates had given mixed reviews about his reliability .\nFISC Judge Rosemary Collyer ordered the FBI on Dec. 17 , 2019 , to provide a plan to address problems identified in the IG report . Collyer criticized the FBI for providing “ false ” and “ misleading ” information about Page in order to obtain four warrants to wiretap the former Trump campaign adviser . ( RELATED : FBI Chief Apologizes For Carter Page FISA Failures )\nFBI Director Christopher Wray submitted a response to Collyer ’ s order Friday . He apologized for the errors in the wiretap applications submitted to the FISC , and said he plans to implement dozens of reforms to address the problems identified in the IG report .\nKris is one of eight individuals designated by FISC as eligible to serve as an amicus curiae , which are designed to act as neutral arbitrators in issues involving the FISA process .\nBoasberg did not provide a rationale for choosing Kris . None of the other seven potential amici curiae have spoken out publicly about the Page FISA issue or the Trump-Russia probe .\nKris was also among the many pundits dismissive of Republican allegations that the FBI mishandled information in the Steele dossier . One of Kris ’ s main targets was Nunes , a California Republican who relentlessly pursued information from the FBI about the Trump-Russia probe .\nIn his March 1 , 2018 , essay at Lawfare , Kris wholeheartedly defended the FBI ’ s actions in the Trump-Russia probe , while criticizing Nunes over a memo he released Feb. 2 , 2018 , laying out a list of alleged problems with the FBI ’ s rationale to surveil Page .\nKris asserted that Nunes “ falsely accused the FBI of deceiving the FISA Court. ” He also questioned whether Nunes and other Republicans would “ face any consequences for their dishonesty . ”\n“ The Nunes memo was dishonest . And if it is allowed to stand , we risk significant collateral damage to essential elements of our democracy , ” wrote Kris , who is now a consultant at Culper Partners and frequent guest on MSNBC .\nKris went as far as entertaining the possibility , first proposed by Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe , that “ Nunes might be prosecuted for obstruction of justice . ”\nKris also wrote that the memo ’ s central claim that the FBI misled the FISC about Christopher Steele “ was not true . ”\nKris has acknowledged since the release of the IG report that the FBI committed some “ significant and serious ” errors in its Carter Page FISA applications . He also conceded in a Lawfare essay published Dec. 23 , 2o19 , that Nunes ’ s assertion that the FBI engaged in irregular behavior was “ correct . ”\nBut for Kris , the biggest takeaway from the IG report were the findings that reflected positively on the FBI .\nHe wrote on Twitter the day the report was released that “ the most important take-away ” from the report was that the FBI did not exert political bias in order to undermine the Trump campaign . He also wrote that the errors identified in the IG report “ don ’ t support any claim of deep-state conspiracy or political bias . ”\n“ The FISC chose a guy who utterly denied the abuses of the Carter Page FISA warrant and then downplayed them when the Inspector General reported on them , ” Nunes told the DNCF .\nA request for comment submitted to Kris ’ s consulting firm , Culper Partners , was not returned . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "412": "A former investigator for the Select Committee on Benghazi says the probe he alleges now is partisan did n't start out that way.House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy had a `` slip of the tongue '' when he told Fox News that the committee 's work is hurting Democrat Hillary Clinton in the presidential polls . `` His reasoning was wrong , '' Air Force Reserve Maj. Bradley Podliska , an intelligence officer , told CNN 's `` State of the Union '' in an interview aired Sunday . `` I honestly do not believe this investigation was set up to go after Hillary . I believe it shifted that way . `` Podliska says he was fired partially for not focusing his investigation heavily enough on Clinton , who was secretary of state during the 2012 Benghazi attack that killed four Americans , including Ambassador Chris Stevens.But on Sunday , the chairman of the House panel says he fired the staffer for mishandling classified information , among other causes .\nRepublican Rep.

    "413": "House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte ( R-Va. ) and Judiciary Committee Republicans today sent a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein calling for the appointment of a second special counsel to investigate unaddressed matters , some connected to the 2016 election and others , including many actions taken by Obama Administration officials like Attorney General Loretta Lynch , FBI Director James Comey , and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton . The letter follows yesterday ’ s House Judiciary Committee approval of H. Res . 446 , as amended , to request documents pertaining to the FBI ’ s investigation of former Secretary Clinton . In their letter , the Judiciary Committee members express concern that the directive given to Special Counsel Robert Mueller is narrow in scope and many concerns arising out of the 2016 presidential election and its aftermath are not being investigated . The members call for the appointment of a second special counsel to investigate grave concerns such as former Attorney General Lynch ’ s directive to former FBI Director Comey to mislead the American people on the nature of the investigation into former Secretary Clinton ; the FBI and Justice Department ’ s investigative decisions related to the Clinton email investigation , including the immunity deals given to potential co-conspirators ; selected leaks of classified information that unmasked U.S. persons incidentally collected upon by the intelligence community ; and the FBI ’ s reliance on “ Fusion GPS ” in its investigation of the Trump campaign , among many others issues .\nIf you ’ re sick and tired of the never-ending “ Trump And The Russians ” scandal , which for all its hype has produced scant little actual evidence of anything other than desultory cooperation on the part of the president ’ s camp with an investigation it quite reasonably believes is a kangaroo court , this letter from Goodlatte ’ s committee might just be what the doctor ordered .\nBecause as Washington scandals go , Trump And The Russians doesn ’ t even make it out of Double-A ball . What Goodlatte and the Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee want is a special counsel to take us up to the Triple-A or major league scandal level , because there are opportunities for playing time available .\nThe unmasking issue still has a lot of undiscovered meat on its bones ; we ’ ve already seen a little evidence of that . The Lynch-Comey-Phoenix Airport nexus deserves a lot more scrutiny than it ’ s received , as do those immunity grants . And the leaks without a doubt deserve a full investigation , and some smug SOB ’ s from the Deep State surely deserve lengthy prison terms .\nBut the Fusion GPS business — and the long-simmering and now-burgeoning Awan brothers scandal — are monsters hiding in D.C. ’ s closet . Here ’ s to both those scandals continuing to crackle and spark over the next several months , on the way to full explosions the legacy media can no longer contain .\nThe central figure in this scandal is a Pakistani national named Imran Awan , who appears to be connected in some way to his country ’ s intelligence service . Awan is an IT professional who was hired in 2004 to handle computer equipment for Florida Democrat congressman Robert Wexler , and he then picked up a job as a shared staffer to work for Wexler ’ s colleague Debbie Wasserman Schultz .\nAwan rode along with Wasserman Schultz as she ascended to the top of the Democratic Party structure , and soon not only was his boss the chair of the Democratic National Committee but Awan ’ s relationship with her led to his building a client list of some 80 Democrat House members who were using either Imran or other members of his family ( a pair of brothers , one of their wives , his own wife ) in a sizable little empire he ’ d built .\nAnd in the meantime , the Awan family was engaging in a pattern of financial activities that looked a whole lot like a mafia operation — questionable real estate deals , bank fraud , kidnapping and extortion , a used-car dealership that might well have been a front for moving stolen cars to Pakistan for sale , and so on . Awan was arrested at Dulles International Airport on Monday as he tried to flee the country while the FBI and Capitol Hill Police were closing in on a bank fraud indictment . In January he had wired some $ 283,000 from the Congressional Federal Credit Union to two individuals in Pakistan ; he was trying to board a flight to Lahore when he had the cuffs put on him .\nBut the real juice with the Awans isn ’ t the bank fraud or the possible stolen cars . The real scandal here is the stolen computers — and the stolen information . It ’ s alleged that the Awans illegally downloaded documents from their clients , some of whom were on the House Intelligence Committee and other sensitive committees , and even walked off with congressional computers . The FBI , in fact , seized a number of CPU ’ s and hard drives found at a house owned by Imran that he was renting to a military couple after the tenants had found the equipment partially destroyed in the garage and called the authorities . We don ’ t know what was on those hard drives .\nThere are even allegations the Awans were blackmailing their clients with information they ’ d found in their e-mails . Your imagination can likely conjure up all kinds of entertaining scenarios around that theme .\nBut the piece de resistance with the Awan brothers scandal is the revelation that Imran Awan , with his foreign intelligence connections , his criminal appearance and his persistent financial problems despite apparently not lacking in the ability to make a buck , had the password to Wasserman Schultz ’ iPad from which she answered her e-mail… as DNC chair .\nForget about the Russians and their supposed hacking of the DNC e-mails . If you ’ re really curious about who got to that information and would have been in a position to shop it to the highest bidder , Imran Awan is the most likely culprit in the room .\nThings are moving very quickly on this case , and it ’ s somewhat telling that Awan was released on bond after being caught trying to flee the country . He has a tracking bracelet on his ankle , but what makes more sense is that he may have turned states ’ evidence in exchange for being let out of jail . Awan ’ s attorney is former Bill Clinton go-fer Chris Gowen , and the lawyer ’ s statement after he ’ d been arrested reads like a press release from a campaign operative rather than a criminal attorney ; bizarrely so , one might say . It might be that Awan is rolling on Wasserman Schultz and the Clintons have decided to hang her out to dry in order to insulate themselves from whatever blowback the DNC e-mails might generate for them .\nOr maybe that isn ’ t possible anymore . Former Washington police detective Rod Wheeler , who you ’ ve probably seen on Fox News from time to time and who most recently was in the news as having done some private snooping in the Seth Rich case , has intimated there is a connection between that case and that of the Awan brothers . We ’ re not going to try to connect those dots without more information , but one ’ s imagination might run riot with those .\nMeanwhile , Republicans in both the House and the Senate are exceptionally curious about Fusion GPS , and with good reason . In case you ’ re not familiar with this outfit , it ’ s the “ opposition research and strategic communications ” firm co-founded by former Wall Street Journal reporters Peter Fritsch and Glenn Simpson which played a significant role in the 2016 election . It was Fusion GPS which commissioned the infamous and debunked “ pee pee dossier , ” written by former British spy Christopher Steele , sourced largely from Steele ’ s Russian contacts and containing a mountain of scurrilous and implausible allegations about Donald Trump ’ s misbehaviors . Fusion GPS was initially contracted by anti-Trump Republican donors , but after Trump got the GOP nomination it was Democrats paying the freight for their work product… and before it was over it looks like James Comey ’ s FBI , amazingly , was picking up the tab .\nThat last part is of special interest to Sen. Charles Grassley and the Senate Judiciary Committee , which has made a priority out of Fusion GPS , and had called Simpson to testify . He did , but only in private , and only after threatening to take the Fifth . That ’ s his right , but what does an oppo researcher need the Fifth Amendment for ?\nBut there ’ s more with Fusion GPS . On Wednesday Tucker Carlson had as a guest on his show one Thor Halvorssen , a Venezuelan native of Norwegian descent who runs a watchdog outfit called the Human Rights Foundation , and Halvorssen told a harrowing story of Fusion GPS attempting to destroy his life with a smear campaign because he ’ d blown the whistle on a crooked contract one of Fusion ’ s clients had with the Venezuelan government to build power plants . That story also got told in a letter Halvorssen sent to Grassley ’ s committee . And then there is Fusion ’ s other client , Natalia Veselnitskaya , the “ Russian lawyer ” whose meeting with Jared Kushner , Donald Trump Jr. , and Paul Manafort has been bandied about as some sort of smoking gun proving collusion with the Russians . It turns out that Veselnitskaya had hired Fusion to help her push to overturn the Magnitsky Act , a sanctions bill targeting crooked Russian oligarchs and human rights abusers . In none of these cases did Fusion bother to register under FARA , the Foreign Agent Registry Act , which would put them on the wrong side of the law .\nGrassley ’ s committee , and Goodlatte ’ s committee , would like to know if this entire Russian business was a setup cooked-up by Fusion ’ s dirty-tricks shop with the collusion of a few actors in the Obama administration . It ’ s hard to blame them .\nThere ’ s a lot of debate about Trump ’ s “ drain the swamp ” mantra these days , but nobody is really denying the swamp exists . And nobody can — not with Fusion GPS and the Awan brothers skulking around in the muck . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "414": "With less than two weeks left before 1,000 or so Libertarian Party delegates select their 2020 presidential and vice presidential nominees in an unprecedented online-only vote , you could probably forgive Jacob Hornberger for being a little irritable .\nHornberger , the 70-year-old founder of the Future of Freedom Foundation , has , after all , won a clear majority of the party 's presidential primaries and caucuses , nonbinding though they may be . He has been in and out and back in Libertarian politics for more than two decades now . And yet ever since Rep. Justin Amash ( L–Mich . ) threw his hat into the ring on April 28 , Hornberger has been all but ignored by the mainstream media , while Amash galivants on cable news networks and HBO 's Real Time with Bill Maher .\nSo it came as little surprise Saturday night that when the formerly Republican and independent congressman participated in his first Libertarian presidential debate , it was Hornberger—author of an eight-part blog series titled , `` Justin Amash , LP Interloper '' —who came out swinging hardest .\n`` Even the libertarian-leaning conservative members of Congress have websites that direct children to the website of the CIA—the most evil agency in U.S. history , '' Hornberger charged in his opening statement , reiterating his critique of a student resource page at amash.house.gov . `` Conservatives love free enterprise , but have long supported the evil , immoral , socialist , central-planning , Republican/Democratic system of immigration controls , which has brought death and suffering to countless people , as well as a brutal police state consisting of highway checkpoints and other initiations of force against innocent people . ''\nRunning as he is a `` campaign of principle for the party of principle , '' in a cycle where many Libertarians seem particularly eager to shed their image as a refuge for ideologically alienated and/or politically opportunistic ex-Republicans , Hornberger portrayed Amash as someone merely tinkering around the edges of the welfare/warfare state .\n`` Conservatives love to 'reform , ' '' he said . `` But reform of tyranny is not freedom . Freedom is a dismantling of tyranny….In this election Libertarian Party members are asked to trade away our principles for a conservative/progressive/libertarian mush , all for the sake of big publicity and the hopes of garnering votes . If we make that trade , we become like them . We become conservatives and progressives . We become the party of expediency . ''\nThose who assume Amash will waltz to a first-ballot nomination over Memorial Day weekend should take a look at the Libertarian Party of Kentucky 's post-debate voting exercise among one-quarter of confirmed L.P. convention delegates . In the first round of polling , Amash received just 33.3 percent of the vote , compared to runner-up Hornberger 's 21 percent . ( The party requires winning candidates to earn 50 percent plus one vote , using an instant runoff process in which the last-place finisher in each round , and everyone under 5 percent , gets lopped off for the next . )\nAmash eventually won the informal vote , but it took him six rounds . Here 's how the totals went , as reported :\nRound 1 : Amash 33.3 percent , Hornberger 21 percent , Jo Jorgensen 16.6 percent , Vermin Supreme 7.7 percent , Judge Jim Gray 6.6 percent , Adam Kokesh 6.2 percent , John Monds 5 percent , Arvin Vohra 1.5 percent .\nRound 2 : Amash 35.1 percent , Hornberger 23.3 percent , Jorgensen 18.5 percent , Supreme 9.3 percent , Kokesh 7.7 percent , Gray 7 percent .\nRound 3 : Amash 37.3 percent , Hornberger 22.4 percent , Jorgensen 21.6 percent , Supreme 10.1 percent , Kokesh 8.6 percent .\nRound 4 : Amash 39.3 percent , Jorgensen 24.8 percent , Hornberger 22.9 percent , Supreme 13 percent .\nRound 5 : Amash 43.8 percent , Jorgensen 30.5 percent , Hornberger 25.7 percent .\nJorgensen , the 1996 Libertarian vice presidential nominee who caught Hornberger from behind in Round 4 and eventually elbowed him out , is campaigning in a sort of third lane between the no-holds-barred radicalism of Hornberger and anarchist Adam Kokesh , and the more pragmatic approach favored by Amash and Judge Jim Gray . `` I 'm offering something that 's principled and practical , '' she said in her closing statement Saturday night .\nJorgensen was the only other debate participant to significantly challenge Amash , albeit in a much less abrasive way than Hornberger ( who said that he could not commit to endorsing the congressman should he win the nomination ) . In her opening statement , she asked Amash a series of questions , most of which he did n't address .\n`` Would you use your authority as commander-in-chief to end our involvement in foreign wars , stop subsidizing the defense of wealthy allies , and bring our troops home ? I will , '' Jorgensen said . `` Would you…use your pardon power to free people convicted of exposing government corruption , violating unconstitutional laws , or committing so-called crimes when there 's no victim ? I will . Would you immediately stop construction on President Trump 's border wall boondoggle , and work to eliminate quotas on immigration so that anyone who wishes to come to America could do so legally ? I will . And last , where do you stand on one of the most divisive issues in America : abortion ? Do you support the Libertarian Party platform ? I do . It 's not enough to be better than Trump or Biden . Our nominee must be deeply principled with a long commitment to our party . ''\nAmash did address abortion in the debate , saying at first : `` I 'm pro-life . I believe that the pro-life position is a Libertarian position , and my goal is to work outside of the Libertarian Party to convince people of that . I work with pregnancy resource centers , for example , here in West Michigan , to try to get the message out and spread the message about life . I do n't think that the government is most effective at doing that sort of thing . As a president , the Libertarian Party supports the idea of not funding abortion providers . So , the Libertarian Party is aligned with my position on that . ''\nHornberger : … You of course pride yourself on being a strict constitutionalist , a supporter of the Constitution . And you supported a bill that called—I think it was in the past couple of years—that called for a nationwide criminal ban on abortion , in which people who were caught engaging in an abortion would be convicted of a federal felony involving a five-year jail sentence . Can you tell me where in the Constitution you rely on to support this federal felony offense for abortion ? Amash : So I 'm not sure about the particular bill you 're referencing , because it was in the past and I do n't know exactly which bill— Hornberger : It 's House bill 36 . Amash : But I can answer the question . The 14th Amendment provides the power to have the federal government address state violations of people 's rights . And as someone who 's pro-life , I believe that a baby inside the womb is a life . And if I believe that that person is a life , then I think it 's appropriate for the federal government to tell states that it is not okay to discriminate against these lives . Now , as a presidential candidate , as a presidential nominee , I wo n't be making the legislation ; the legislature will decide that . Congress decides on the legislation and sends things to my desk . With the parties very divided over this issue , nothing 's going to come to my desk that does that . That 's my view of it , and when I 'm voting in Congress , that 's how I would vote . But as a presidential candidate , with respect to people who are concerned within the party because there is a split within the party between pro-life people and pro-choice people , the president will have very little opportunity for that kind of thing , because there is a huge divide within the party . So the only thing that is likely to come to my desk as president is a bill to not fund abortion providers , no federal funding for abortion providers , and that is something that all Libertarians within the party agree on . At least , the vast majority of them agree on that .\nHornberger 's most influential backers , at the Libertarian Party Mises Caucus and on the podcasting airwaves , have dinged Amash for backing the `` Deep State '' in the impeachment of President Donald Trump ( despite Amash 's lead role in nearly de-funding the National Security Agency 's domestic surveillance operations back in 2013 ) , and for potentially being another in a lengthening line of ex-Republicans who fail to ignite a lasting ideological fire .\n`` I even think that in some scenarios 1 percent might be better than 4 percent , '' libertarian comedian Dave Smith said to Hornberger on an episode of his Part of the Problem podcast last month . `` I think those votes are worthless if you did n't actually convert people or introduce them to liberty or change their way of looking at the world at all . ''\nOr as Ludwig von Mises Institute senior fellow and popular podcaster Tom Woods , with whom Smith taped an Amash-criticizing podcast last week , said at a Mises Caucus-sponsored event down the street from the 2018 Libertarian National Convention : `` So yeah , we wo n't get the 70 million votes , but maybe we get 1 million people who say , ' I never looked at the world the same way again after I listened to those people . ' ''\nAmash 's answer to the broad critique is to remind people that most Americans are not self-identified libertarians , no matter how intrinsically libertarian they may be without knowing it , and that political actors wishing to have any kind of influence need to acknowledge the fallen world around them .\n`` I 've been a libertarian my entire life , a small-l libertarian , '' Amash said Saturday . `` And I believe that when you work within government , you have to make those changes that will convince people to come to your side….You have to present libertarianism to them with the issues that they care about or are concerned about right now . It ca n't be some kind of overnight experiment where we re-work all of society or re-work all of our government . ''\n`` In fact , '' Amash continued , `` that 's arrogance in the form of central planning of another sort , to come in and say , 'We 're just going to throw out everything we have overnight and start anew . ' We have to do things gradually and carefully , and we have to trust the people to make decisions through our constitutional system of government .

    "415": "WikiLeaks founder and chieftain Julian Assange was tossed out of the Ecuadorean embassy in London into the hands of British police last week .\nAssange is wanted on charges of sexual assault in Sweden and charges of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion in the U.S . He allegedly helped Army private Chelsea ( née Bradley ) Manning illegally obtain a password that led Manning to leak hundreds of thousands of classified documents to Assange for WikiLeaks to publish .\nBoth Sweden and the U.S. have requested that Assange be extradited to face justice . It ’ s not clear which extradition request will be granted first , but one or the other is certain to be .\nAssange ’ s defenders are screaming that he should not face the U.S. charges because he is a journalist and is protected absolutely by the First Amendment . It ’ s very important to understand why Assange isn ’ t a journalist and why the First Amendment is no bar to his prosecution under federal law .\nThe OED ’ s definition of “ journalist ” is “ a person who writes for newspapers or magazines or prepares news to be broadcast on television or radio. ” To that we probably have to add people who write about current events for online publications . The key part of the definition is the preparation of news for publication .\nNeither does Assange prepare news for publication nor does WikiLeaks publish news . They are merely a pipeline by which U.S. secrets are published with the intent of damaging our national security .\nThe example of Assange ’ s behavior that defines him and WikiLeaks was WikiLeaks ’ March 2017 publication of a substantial portion of the computer hacking tools that the CIA uses to conduct espionage abroad . The “ stories ” were published in WikiLeaks ’ “ Vault 7. ” They weren ’ t news stories revealing what the CIA was doing : it was the computer software itself — the lines of code — that were being used .\nThe difference there was rather than publish news about the CIA ’ s behavior and the targets against which the tools were employed , Assange and WikiLeaks published the actual computer software . Doing so gave every adversary — nations , terrorist networks , and others — information which they could use to protect themselves against U.S. espionage .\nWikiLeaks isn ’ t a news publication but a cyber bulletin board on which any leaker can have America ’ s most closely-guarded secrets published . Assange isn ’ t a journalist : he ’ s an anti-American activist whose mission in life is to damage the United States . As Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said when he was CIA director , WikiLeaks functions as if it were a “ non-state hostile intelligence service . ”\nThere are journalists who fit the OED ’ s definition but act as irresponsibly as WikiLeaks does . Consider the actions of the New York Times and Washington Post in two cases : the 1971 publication of the Pentagon Papers and the 2006 publication of the CIA ’ s “ warrantless wiretapping ” activity .\nIn the Pentagon Papers case , an employee of the RAND corporation , Daniel Ellsberg , copied and stole a top-secret analysis of American policy in Vietnam . He leaked the analysis to the New York Times which began publishing parts of the leaked papers .\nPrior restraint is the most severe form of censorship . For the first time in history , the government obtained a court order enjoining further publication by the Times . Ellsberg then leaked the study to the Washington Post which began publishing them . The government tried and failed to get a D.C. court to enjoin further publication by the Post .\nThe matter quickly rose to the Supreme Court which held ( by a 6-3 vote ) that prior restraint was unconstitutional . In dismissing the claim that prior restraint was justified by national security concerns , the Court said that , “ The word ‘ security ’ is a broad , vague generality whose contours should not be invoked to abrogate the fundamental law embodied in the First Amendment . ”\nFlash forward to 2006 . After the 9-11 attacks , the CIA and the NSA — using their authorities under the new “ Patriot Act ” and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , began intercepting and monitoring electronic communications of an enormous number of people , some of whom were inside U.S. borders .\nThe program reportedly resulted in the interdiction of several terrorist attacks and generated a wealth of intelligence information about terrorist activities both within the U.S. and abroad . It was disclosed to Congress in classified briefings .\nA year before publication of the matter , a CIA leaker informed the New York Times about the agencies ’ actions , and the Times ’ reporters , James Risen and Eric Lichtblau , began writing stories about it . Risen began writing a book on the information divulged by the leaker . The Times informed the government that they intended to publish the details of the “ warrantless wiretapping ” program .\nIn 2005 , meetings were held at the Times ’ offices during which top Bush administration officials attempted unsuccessfully to persuade the Times staff to not publish the stories . At that point , then-president George W. Bush invited the Times ’ publisher , Arthur Sulzberger , to the Oval Office to make a last plea to not publish the stories . Sulzberger wasn ’ t persuaded .\nPresident Bush and his team could do no more . Under the Supreme Court ’ s ruling in the Pentagon Papers case , they couldn ’ t use the courts to restrain publication . They had to rely on the Times ’ judgment and patriotism . Both were not sufficient to restrain the reporters , editors , and publisher of the Times .\nOn December 16 , 2005 the Times began publishing its stores on the CIA/NSA program . Risen ’ s book State of War was released on the same day giving great detail about the program .\nThe Times , Risen , and Lichtblau acted irresponsibly and despicably . Their actions caused terrorists to change the means by which they communicated . That probably cost American and allied lives and delayed our ability to find Osama bin Laden .\nThe courts remain divided on the constitutionality of the CIA/NSA program . The CIA leaker , Jeffrey Sterling , was convicted and sentenced to three years in prison .\nThe difference between what the Times did and what Assange did is not only the fact that the Times is a newspaper and its reporters are journalists . The two differences are reason why one is protected by the First Amendment and the other isn ’ t .\nFirst , the Times and its reporters were intentionally exposing top-secret information by writing up and publishing the government ’ s actions . Assange and WikiLeaks published the literal computer software used to conduct espionage against nations and terrorists . The Times ’ publication of the CIA/NSA program was , at least arguably , news . WikiLeaks ’ publication of the CIA ’ s hacking tools wasn ’ t .\nSecond , Assange and WikiLeaks are complicit in the acts of the leakers whose information they publish . They pay the leakers expenses ( and possibly pay them more ) as well as help them avoid prosecution .\nWhen Edward Snowden , an employee of a CIA contractor , began leaking top-secret information , he was taken in hand by Sarah Harrison of WikiLeaks which reportedly began to pay his expenses . Assange advised Snowden to travel to Russia instead of South America in order to escape U.S. extradition . Assange , who has had a cozy relationship with Russia and Russian intelligence agencies for a long time , reportedly bought Snowden ’ s airline ticket to Russia .\nAssange ’ s and WikiLeaks ’ are the actions of hostile intelligence agents , not of journalists . For those reasons , they fall outside the First Amendment ’ s protection of the free press .\nWhether Assange is extradited to Sweden to face rape charges before he faces charges here doesn ’ t much matter . Putting him in prison is justice , but it won ’ t stop WikiLeaks from functioning . It has become too large , covert , and multifaceted for Assange ’ s imprisonment to stop its activities .\nBecause WikiLeaks is acting like a hostile intelligence service it should be treated like one . Every cyber weapon at our disposal should be employed against it . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "416": "Math is a deeply frustrating subject for many elementary and high school students . But Seattle public schools are gearing up to accuse math of a litany of more serious crimes : imperialism , dehumanization , and oppression of marginalized persons .\nThe district has proposed a new social justice-infused curriculum that would focus on `` power and oppression '' and `` history of resistance and liberation '' within the field of mathematics . The curriculum is n't mandatory , but provides a resource for teachers who want to introduce ethnic studies into the classroom vis a vis math . According to Education Week :\nSeattle 's four-page framework is still in the proposal stage . If adopted , its ideas will be included in existing math classes as part of the district 's broader effort to infuse ethnic studies into all subjects across the K-12 spectrum . Tracy Castro-Gill , Seattle 's ethnic studies director , said her team hopes to have frameworks completed in all subjects by June for board approval . If the frameworks are approved , teachers would be expected to incorporate those ideas and questions into the math they teach beginning next fall , Castro-Gill said . No districtwide—or mandated—math/ethnic studies curriculum is planned , but groups of teachers are working with representatives of local community organizations to write instructional units for teachers to use if they wish , she said . `` Seattle is definitely on the forefront with this , '' said Robert Q. Berry III , the president of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics . `` What they 're doing follows the line of work we hope we can move forward as we think about the history of math and who contributes to that , and also about deepening students ' connection with identity and agency . ''\nThe proposal has drawn fire from the right . The American Conservative 's Rod Dreher referred to it derisively as `` woke math , '' writing :\nThe young people who are going to learn real math are those whose parents can afford to put them in private schools . The public school kids of all races are going to get dumber and dumber … and this is going to compel the wokesters in charge of Human Resources at institutions along life 's way to demand changing standards to fit political goals . Eventually , bridges are going to start falling down . That too will be the fault of Whiteness .\nThat 's a hyperbolic statement . But having read over the proposed framework , I have to say that it does seem fairly terrible . It 's chock full of social justice jargon that sounds smart but is actually vapid . What does it mean to decode mathematical `` beauty '' or `` identify how the development of mathematics has been erased from learning in school ? '' ( Has it been erased ? That seems like a problem for history class . ) The guidance says it will `` re-humanize mathematics through experiential learning '' and facilitate learning `` independently and interdependently . '' That 's a fancy way of saying almost nothing at all .\nThe guidance also includes some extremely political , simplistic talking points that might be popular among activist academics but are in reality somewhat dubious . This is verbatim from the proposal : Students will be able to `` identify the inherent inequities of the standardized testing system used to oppress and marginalize people and communities of color , '' `` explain how math has been used to exploit natural resources , '' and `` explain how math dictates economic oppression . '' Each of these statements are debatable , but they are not being presented as such . It would be one thing to hold a class discussion about the strengths and weaknesses of standardized testing , but what 's happening here is that students are being trained to reject standardized testing due to its `` inherent inequity , '' which is asserted as some kind of proven fact .\nIf math is too daunting for students , a better option would be for schools to stop making it mandatory . Giving parents—and even students themselves—more choice and control over their own educational experience is always a plus , and few people actually need to understand higher mathematics to function in society . Infusing the existing math curriculum with a bunch of unfounded progressive assumptions about cultural appropriation is a silly approach . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "417": "From Hollywood comes a steady stream of movies casting powerful liberals as embattled and marginalized conservatives as menacing . Hollywood ’ s latest tribute to a hopelessly entitled press , The Post , is in that vein . Meryl Streep plays an astonishingly brave and nervy Katharine Graham , willing to risk her fortune and even her freedom to publish the Pentagon Papers in the Washington Post . It is a feel-good film for the kind of press liberals who consider Trump ’ s mere tweets a singular and monstrous threat to their freedom .\nThe film borrows from the Nixon tapes to make it seem like his impotent ravings imperiled her paper . But most of those rantings don ’ t even pertain to the Pentagon Papers , and in the one tape that does Nixon sounds remarkably blasé . If director Steven Spielberg had included the whole conversation with Al Haig in the movie , viewers would have heard the two agreeing that the disclosure of the Pentagon Papers primarily threatened to tarnish the legacy of the Kennedy administration .\nNixon , after all , ended the war that Post editor Ben Bradlee ’ s close chum JFK started . Yet to most casual viewers , Nixon will appear as the president who had the most to hide . The subtext of the film , of course , is that Trump stands as the new Nixon . According to press reports , Meryl Streep and Spielberg squeezed into their visit to Washington , D.C. ( for the premiere ) a dinner with the Obamas , and Tom Hanks has stoutly rejected a hypothetical question from a reporter about a screening at the White House . Trump , we ’ re supposed to take from this posturing , is a unique threat to the press .\nBut what has he done to it again ? Nothing , save criticize it . Has he wiretapped any reporters ? No , the dinner mate of Streep and Spielberg did that . Obama ’ s uber-progressive attorney general Eric Holder had Fox News reporter James Rosen investigated for talking to a State Department official . Rosen was labeled a “ criminal co-conspirator ” under the Espionage Act , a law that liberals , as we ’ ve seen from the Mueller investigation and the Flynn entrapment , like to use against conservatives but otherwise treat as antiquated and absurd .\nIn The Post , the Nixon administration ’ s invoking of that law is presented as self-serving and tyrannical . But these days the admirers of Daniel Ellsberg and his media conduits rejoice at its partisan applications . In power , liberals love wiretappings , entrapments , and quarantining undesirable press ( Obama wanted Fox News excluded from press briefings ) ; out of power , all of that suddenly becomes evidence of a government run amok .\nIt is fitting that smug and privileged celebrities play such phony heroes as Graham and Bradlee . They share a lot in common . Streep ’ s Graham frets over doing time in the slammer , which is about as convincing as Streep ’ s award show speeches in which she portrays multimillionaire “ artists ” as the ostracized kin of illegal immigrants . Liberals love to turn bullies into victims and victims into bullies . The real complaint underlying Hollywood ’ s hagiography is that liberals don ’ t possess one hundred percent of the power in America . All of their whining about “ tyranny ” is just a projection of their own desire for it .\nThey want checks on everyone ’ s power but their own . It is out of that sense of entitlement that their Trump hysteria has grown , mushrooming to the point where they feel terrorized by a tweet .\nThe unstated premise of movies like The Post is that the press deserves more public trust than elected government officials . Why ? The press is as corrupt as any other player in politics , and it is unelected . One of the fatuous lines from the movie , which audiences are supposed to clap at excitedly , is that the press serves the “ governed , not government. ” What does that even mean in a democracy , where the governed are the government ? That the press ’ s role is inherently subversive and destructive unless its buddies are in power ?\nIn a democracy of , by , and for the people , a press with any sense of proportion and perspective would not freak out at criticism from a duly elected president . It would not hype that up into a “ crisis ” and celebrate Hollywood for drawing parallels between Nixon and Trump . It would accept that arrangement as the normal functioning of democracy . Instead , the press has spent the last year lecturing the American people on its “ abnormal ” choice of a leader , all the while fantasizing about the much greater abnormality of an undeclared fourth branch of government operating like a political party without scrutiny . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "418": "Nothing makes government grow like a crisis . People get scared , politicians respond to that fear with promises that the state will step in and make everything better , and government ends up larger and more powerful . The pandemic of COVID-19 coronavirus threatens a world-wide wave of sickness , but it 's the healthiest thing to happen to government power in a very long time . As it leaves government with a rosy glow , however , our freedom will end up more haggard than ever .\n`` You can look at it as socialized medicine , '' Rep. Ted Yoho ( R–Fla . ) said on Tuesday about White House proposals to have the federal government foot the bill for uninsured COVID-19 patients . `` But in the face of an outbreak , a pandemic , what 's your options ? ''\nYoho is n't the only Republican to have found a new place in his heart for government control of healthcare ; obviously , the Trump administration is on-board , too . During Senate testimony , the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ' Robert Kadlec , who coordinates the department 's COVID-19 efforts , floated the idea of treating virus patients as disaster victims eligible for federal funds .\nWhat else can you do `` in the face of an outbreak , a pandemic '' that has , so far , resulted in an estimated 94,000 cases and 3,200 deaths worldwide ( though the numbers continue to grow ) ? You could , I suppose , rely on the same not-yet-entirely government-dominated health system that deals with influenza outbreaks every year . In the 2019-20 flu season , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention our long-time viral enemy has , so far , infected 32 million Americans , sent 310,000 to the hospital , and killed 18,000 .\nThat 's not to say that COVID-19 is n't serious , or that people are n't suffering from its effects . But we forget about our annual wrestling match with a deadly disease , the flu , while freaking out about the emergence of a virus that is frightening mostly because of its novelty , despite any evidence that we 're inadequate to the challenge .\nFear is the key here to Yoho 's sudden love for socialized medicine , as well as other panicked proposals for the government to somehow save us from the pandemic . Fear is a survival characteristic , but it makes us vulnerable to the impulse—or demand—that we surrender control to somebody else .\n`` All animals experience fear—human beings , perhaps , most of all . Any animal incapable of fear would have been hard pressed to survive , '' wrote economic historian Robert Higgs , the author of Crisis and Leviathan ( 1987 ) , a book-length examination of how bad times drive government to grow in power and scope . `` The people who have the effrontery to rule us , who call themselves our government , understand this basic fact of human nature . They exploit it , and they cultivate it . Whether they compose a warfare state or a welfare state , they depend on it to secure popular submission , compliance with official dictates , and , on some occasions , affirmative cooperation with the state 's enterprises and adventures . ''\nOr , as Rahm Emanuel put it in 2008 : `` You never want a serious crisis to go to waste . And what I mean by that is an opportunity to do things that you think you could not do before . ''\nPoliticians are human beings , too ( allegedly so , anyway ) and subject to fear , including fear of being voted out of office by panic-stricken constituents looking for officials to `` do something . '' So , their instinct to exploit a crisis complements their inclination to soothe the fearful by making efforts—even counterproductive ones—to assure the public that everything will be just fine .\nThat combination of calculation and fright gave us not only a proposal to stick the taxpayers with the medical bills of the uninsured , but also a seemingly pointless cut in the fed funds rate by the Federal Reserve , and proposals for massive federal spending to off-set economic disruptions by the spread of COVID-19 .\n`` The Federal Reserve has become the default doctor for whatever ails the U.S. economy , '' noted a skeptical Wall Street Journal editorial board . But economic fallout from the virus `` relates mainly to the damage to global supply chains and expected limits on travel and commerce as the world tries to mitigate the rates of infection . Nobody is going to take that flight to Tokyo because the Fed is suddenly paying less on excess reserves . ''\nThat combination of calculation and fear also gives us Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren 's proposal to `` enact at least a $ 400 billion fiscal stimulus package to head off the potential economic impact of coronavirus '' on top of `` free care for coronavirus '' that she also endorses . Will the spending repair disrupted supply chains and put production lines back in operation a minute sooner than demand for goods and services dictates ? Not a chance—but Warren probably hoped it would look sufficiently compassionate to those looking for government to `` do something '' to keep her ( now-concluded ) presidential campaign on life support .\nPublic health has long been a playing field for fear and calculation , giving us intrusive laws that sit on the books , waiting to be invoked by the next microorganism to catch the public 's attention .\nThose laws include a nearly unlimited power to quarantine people suspected of exposure to infectious diseases—and then bill them for the confinement , as has happened to Americans returning from Wuhan , China , where COVID-19 appears to have originated . Never mind that `` quarantines of passengers arriving from mainland China appear excessive and are inconsistent with available epidemiologic data , '' according to bioethicists Lawrence Gostin and James Hodge . Crises breed more government authority , not sensible restraint .\nThere 's usually little pushback because `` people are pretty compliant as long as they believe that their best interests are being taken care of , '' Wendy K. Mariner , a health law professor at Boston University , told The Washington Post .\nLike all crises , the COVID-19 pandemic will pass , hopefully with a minimum of illness and death . But it will leave behind a residue of laws , spending , and precedents for future government actions that wo n't depart in its wake . That 's because of what Higgs calls the `` ratchet effect , '' by which each crisis sees government shrink a little , but never back to its pre-crisis status . `` Thus , crisis typically has produced not just a temporarily bigger government but also permanently bigger government , '' he wrote .\nSo , even after the public panic retreats , the politicians ' calculations subside , and COVID-19 becomes more knowable and treatable , we 'll be left with the permanent swelling of government caused by the latest crisis . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

This was during an hour-long special he very generously put together to discuss The Declaration of Independents : How Libertarian Politics Can Fix What 's Wrong with America , which I had freshly co-written with Nick Gillespie . It was a galvanizing moment—I had been doing increasing amounts of cable news , but had never seen anyone with as much TV charisma and quick wit as this former VJ . Soon she would begin collaborating regularly with both ███ TV and Stossel , the latter of whom brought her on as a special correspondent even though he did n't know half the time what the hell she was talking about ( which , in typical John fashion , he would say out loud , on television ) .\nLloyd Grove at The Daily Beast would later recount how the seeds of what would eventually flower as The Independents were planted at a ███ Weekend in Puerto Rico in February 2012 . Stossel , Grove wrote ,\nserved as a mentor and helped recruit Kennedy to the six-year-old network . `` She 's a libertarian and I love that—there are n't many libertarians on TV , '' Stossel says , adding that Kennedy `` is much more of a performer than I am . She lights up the screen . '' Some of their bonding occurred in the middle of a beach volleyball clinic that Stossel ran during a ███ weekend retreat in Puerto Rico . `` He was in volleyball shorts and shirtless , and the man is in better shape than most 20-year-olds I know , '' Kennedy says of the 66-year-old Stossel , who had been using her as a special correspondent since the summer of 2012 . `` He 's a really meticulous person , and his libertarian views evolved over time . I think when you start out as a liberal and you come to be a libertarian , you tend to be really forgiving of other people 's political evolution , and you realize that people can change and come into their own . Libertarians can be loners . A lot of us can feel like misfits . ''\nKennedy was like a unicorn for Stossel : A libertarian who was already great at television . For the rest of his run , John labored at the largely thankless and rarely acknowledged task of training questionably dressed free-market types like me to be less like Broadcast News ' Albert Brooks and just a wee more William Hurt-ish . There were the green-room coachings ( `` Do n't bore people with a bunch of numbers ! `` ) , the on-set eye-glazes when you wandered off point , the cutting quips about questionable ties . It was tough love , but , well , you have to consider the raw material here .\nThe result of Stossel 's conscious exertions is that the universe of camera-ready libertarians is much larger and considerably more polished than it was seven years ago . ( Judge Andrew Napolitano 's late , lamented Freedom Watch also deserves a shout-out here for giving reps to us rabble . ) Next-generation shows like Kennedy get to take their libertarianism more for granted precisely because Stossel had done the shovel work ( * cough * ) of introducing fundamental concepts and breaking in nerds .\nSo thank you , John Stossel , not just for making a damn fine program for millions of Americans , but for helping groom some of us to make our own TV programming , now and into a bright future .\nAnd make sure , everyone , to tune in at 10 p.m . ET and again at midnight , to see what Kennedy and I have in store for the 'stache ! \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "422": "Washington ( AFP ) – President Donald Trump on Thursday authorized sanctions against any official at the International Criminal Court who investigates US troops , ramping up pressure to stop its case into alleged war crimes in Afghanistan .\nIn an executive order , Trump said the United States would block US property and assets of anyone from The Hague-based tribunal involved in probing or prosecuting US troops .\n“ We can not — we will not — stand by as our people are threatened by a kangaroo court , ” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement to reporters .\n“ I have a message to many close allies around the world — your people could be next , especially those from NATO countries who fought terrorism in Afghanistan right alongside of us . ”\nThe court responded by stating that its president O-Gon Kwon “ rejects measures taken against ICC , ” calling them “ unprecedented ” and saying they “ undermine our common endeavor to fight impunity and to ensure accountability for mass atrocities . ”\nUS Attorney General Bill Barr alleged , without giving detail , that Russia and other adversaries of the United States have been “ manipulating ” the court .\nUsing Trump ’ s “ America First ” language , Barr said the administration was trying to bring accountability to a global body .\n“ This institution has become , in practice , little more than a political tool employed by unaccountable international elites , ” he said .\nEuropean Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell voiced “ serious concern ” and said the court “ must be respected and supported by all nations . ”\nDutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok said he was “ very disturbed ” by the US move , and said The Netherlands supported the court on its soil .\n“ The ICC is crucial in the fight against impunity and upholding international rule of law , ” Blok wrote on Twitter .\nHuman Rights Watch said Trump ’ s order “ demonstrates contempt for the global rule of law . ”\n“ This assault on the ICC is an effort to block victims of serious crimes whether in Afghanistan , Israel or Palestine from seeing justice , ” said the group ’ s Washington director , Andrea Prasow .\nBut the move was hailed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , one of Trump ’ s closest allies , who has been angered by the ICC ’ s moves — strongly opposed by Washington — to probe alleged war crimes in the Palestinian territories .\nIn a reference to Israeli settlements , Netanyahu accused the court of fabricating accusations that Jews living in their historical homeland constitutes a war crime .\nTrump has been tearing down global institutions he sees as hindering his administration ’ s interests , recently ordering a pullout from the World Health Organization over its coronavirus response .\nThe Trump administration has been livid over the International Criminal Court ’ s investigation into atrocities in Afghanistan , America ’ s longest-running war .\nThe administration last year revoked the US visa of the court ’ s chief prosecutor , Gambian-born Fatou Bensouda , to demand that she end the Afghanistan probe .\nBut judges in March said the investigation could go ahead , overturning an initial rejection of Bensouda ’ s request .\nUnder Trump ’ s order on Thursday , visa restrictions will be expanded to any court official involved in investigations into US forces .\nThe United States argues that it has its own procedures in place to investigate accusations against troops .\n“ We are committed to uncovering , and if possible holding people accountable , for their wrongdoing — any wrongdoing , ” Barr said .\nTrump , however , used his executive powers last year to clear three military members over war crimes , including in Afghanistan .\nAmong them was Eddie Gallagher , who had been convicted by a military tribunal of stabbing to death with a hunting knife a prisoner of war from the Islamic State group in Iraq .\nGallagher had become a cause celebre among US conservatives , although Trump ’ s action troubled some in the US military .\nFounded in 2002 , the International Criminal Court immediately ran into opposition from Washington , where the then administration of George W. Bush encouraged countries to shun it .\nFormer president Barack Obama took a more cooperative approach with the court , but the United States remained outside of it . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "423": "Public school teachers are behind a leading far-left militant group that is part of the Antifa network that federal officials say is committing “ domestic terrorist violence . ”\nBy Any Means Necessary , which has played a key role in riots in Berkeley , Sacramento and elsewhere , has dozens of public school teachers among its members , including among its most prominent leaders .\nThe FBI and Department of Homeland Security began paying closer attention to Antifa groups in general after BAMN and other extremists started a riot and attacked marchers at a white nationalist rally in Sacramento last July , Politico reported on Friday . The Sacramento violence left at least 10 people hospitalized , several of whom had knife wounds .\nOne of BAMN ’ s most prominent organizers is Yvette Felarca , a Berkeley middle school teacher and pro-violence militant . Felarca currently faces charges of inciting a riot for her role in the Sacramento violence .\nAfter BAMN and other antifa groups staged violent protests in Berkeley to keep right-wing author Milo Yiannopoulos from speaking , Felarca defended her group ’ s acts of violence . BAMN was able to cancel another event , this time an April speech by pro-Trump author Ann Coulter , by promising a repeat performance of the Milo riots . ( RELATED : ‘ INFERNO ’ — Milo Speech Cancelled After Rioters Set Campus Ablaze [ VIDEO ] )\nThe FBI and DHS say Antifa groups like BAMN are engaging in “ domestic terrorist violence , ” according to the Politico report .\nJust last weekend , Felarca helped organize BAMN ’ s mass demonstrations that “ shut down ” an anti-Marxism rally in Berkeley . As with BAMN ’ s other organized actions , left-wing actors at Saturday ’ s demonstrations violently attacked peaceful protesters . House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi condemned the Antifa violence in Berkeley , while Felarca called BAMN ’ s actions a “ resounding success . ”\nBAMN ’ s members appear to be mixing their far-left activism with their roles as teachers . ( RELATED : Documents Tie Berkeley Riot Organizers To Pro-Pedophilia Group )\nBAMN organizer and high school teacher Nicole Conaway organized a “ sickout ” at her school in 2015 , leading other teachers in calling in sick to protest the policies of Republican Gov . Rick Snyder . The sickout forced six Detroit-area schools to cancel classes , affecting nearly 4,000 students .\nOne month later , Conaway led students in a school walkout protesting poor building conditions . She was one of three BAMN organizers arrested in connection with the protest . Other BAMN members have led similar protests at the schools where they teach .\nIn Berkeley , Felarca and other BAMN members repeatedly abused their positions of influence over students in service of their own radical goals , Berkeley ’ s public school district charged in court filings obtained by local news organization Berkeleyside .\nDespite repeated warnings , the district said Felarca continued to try to recruit students into her radical organization , including during work hours . The leftist teacher frequently tried to bring students on school-sponsored trips to BAMN-related activities , the district said , describing the trips as attempts to “ indoctrinate ” the students .\nThe school district accused Felarca and other BAMN members of weaponizing students to derail disciplinary hearings for Felarca , after student protesters repeatedly swarmed into the disciplinary hearings . The school district claimed that Felarca and other BAMN members “ were actively trying to brainwash and manipulate ” students to serve her “ own selfish interests , ” calling her conduct “ particularly reprehensible. ” Felarca continues teaching today .\nOakland Technical High School teacher and BAMN member Tania Kappner worked with Felarca this past January to organize students and teachers in a walkout in protesting Trump . Kappner was identified in the media as a BAMN member as early as 2011 .\nBAMN is active within both the National Education Association — the nation ’ s largest teacher ’ s union — as well as with local and regional teacher ’ s unions in Michigan and California .\nLast year , 17 different BAMN members ran for elected positions on the Detroit Federation of Teachers , according to a newsletter sent out by the DFT . BAMN also ran five candidates for different national leadership positions with the NEA in 2017 .\nWhen the Berkeley school district suspended Felarca for her violent activism in 2016 ( for which she was charged with inciting a riot ) , the local teacher ’ s union sued the school on Felarca ’ s behalf .\nIn January 2015 , BAMN organizer Steve Conn was elected president of the Detroit Federation of Teachers . The DFT ’ s executive board charged Conn with misconduct later that year and removed him from office .\nConn and his wife , former teacher Heather Miller , were fired back in 2007 after leading a student protest that resulted in students being pepper sprayed . The couple sued and got their jobs back , in addition to a $ 300,000 settlement . Conn continues teaching today at Western High School .\nBAMN was founded by the Revolutionary Workers League , an openly Marxist organization , in 1995 .\nAs TheDC first reported in April , internal documents from the North American Man/Boy Love Association ( NAMBLA ) tie BAMN to NAMBLA. , reveal the RWL — BAMN ’ s parent organization — worked with NAMBLA in the years just before the communist group founded BAMN .\nOne of BAMN ’ s founding members is on record identifying as a NAMBLA member , calling the pro-pedophilia group the victim of a “ witch-hunt. ” ( Read TheDC ’ s full story on the ties between NAMBLA and BAMN here . ) \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "424": "NBC News spent weeks documenting its science contributor ’ s battle with COVID-19 , but now he admits that he never tested positive for it .\nDr. Joseph Fair , a virologist , believed he had the virus and appeared on air numerous times to discuss his struggle with illness in May and June . On Tuesday , Fair admitted that he tested negative for the virus multiple times but had originally believed he had it regardless . Fair also tested negative upon taking an antibody test .\n“ My undiagnosed/suspected COVID illness from nearly 2 months ago remains an undiagnosed mystery as a recent antibody test was negative , ” Fair tweeted Tuesday . “ I had myriad COVID symptoms , was hospitalized in a COVID ward & treated for COVID-related co-morbidities , despite testing negative by nasal swab . ”\nI was severely ill for 2 weeks , 4 days of it in critical condition , resulting in pneumonia , diffuse lung injury & 18lbs of weight loss . My path forward is a 2nd AB test , & follow-up with a pulmonologist & tropical medicine specialist in an effort to diagnose what made me so ill. — Dr. Joseph Fair ( @ curefinder ) July 7 , 2020\nI was truly humbled by this experience and again thank you all for the support throughout . — Dr. Joseph Fair ( @ curefinder ) July 7 , 2020\nFair suggested during an interview on the “ Today ” show May 14 that he may have gotten the virus through his eye during a flight . He conducted the interview while in a New Orleans hospital , the Washington Free Beacon reported . ( RELATED : MSNBC Analyst Suggests Using Coronavirus To Prosecute Trump For ‘ Negligent Homicide ’ — Gets An Assist From Former Democratic Candidate )\nNBC News originally told viewers about the negative tests , but abandoned that part of the narrative as the story continued , according to Steve Krakauer ’ s “ Fourth Watch ” newsletter . During a June 14 interview with Chuck Todd on “ Meet the Press , ” no one noted that Fair had already tested negative at least five times , according to Krakauer .\n“ In the end , NBC ’ s viewers were left with two very alarming – and false – impressions , ” Krakauer wrote . “ First , that an expert virologist can take every precaution but can still catch COVID-19 through his eyes . False . Second , that tests can be so untrustworthy that you can have multiple negative tests and still have coronavirus . ”\nNBC News has not yet updated its May 14 article claiming the virologist got “ coronavirus despite being in good health and taking precautions. ” The network did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ███ .\n“ This pandemic is scary enough without this false storyline introduced into the news picture , ” Krakauer added . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "425": "Gay and lesbian couples could face legal chaos if the Supreme Court rules against same-sex marriage in the next few weeks .\nSame-sex weddings could come to a halt in many states , depending on a confusing mix of lower-court decisions and the sometimes-contradictory views of state and local officials .\nAmong the 36 states in which same-sex couples can now marry are 20 in which federal judges invoked the Constitution to strike down marriage bans .\nThose rulings would be in conflict with the nation 's highest court if the justices uphold the power of states to limit marriage to heterosexual couples . A decision is expected by late June in cases from Kentucky , Michigan , Ohio and Tennessee .\nTop officials in some states , including California , seem determined to allow gay and lesbian couples to continue to marry no matter how the court decision comes out . But some county clerks , who actually issue marriage licenses , might not go along , experts said .\nIn other states , a high court ruling in favor of state bans would serve to prohibit any more such unions , but also could give rise to new efforts to repeal marriage bans through the legislature or the ballot .\nThe scenario may be unlikely , given the Supreme Court 's role in allowing those lower court rulings to take effect before the justices themselves decided the issue . But if the court does n't endorse same-sex marriage nationwide , `` it would be chaos , '' said Howard Wasserman , a Florida International University law professor .\nMarriages already on the books probably are safe , said several scholars and civil liberties lawyers . `` There 's a very strong likelihood these marriages would have to be respected , no matter what , '' said Christopher Stoll , senior staff attorney with the National Center for Lesbian Rights .\nGay and lesbian couples could continue to marry in the 16 states that have same-sex marriage because of state court rulings , acts of the legislature or statewide votes .\nSimilarly , the 14 states that prohibit same-sex couples from marrying , including the four directly involved in the Supreme Court cases , could continue enforcing their state marriage laws . That would include Alabama , where a federal judge has struck down the state 's constitutional ban on same-sex marriage , but put her ruling on hold pending the high court 's decision .\nOf the remaining 20 states , any that fought unsuccessfully to preserve marriage bans would not have much trouble resuming enforcement . `` That state can immediately start saying we 're going to deny marriage licenses to same-sex couples going forward , '' said Cornell University law professor Michael Dorf .\nThat list might include Alaska , Arizona , Florida , Idaho , Indiana , Kansas , Montana , Nevada , North Carolina , Oklahoma , South Carolina , Utah , West Virginia , Wisconsin and Wyoming .\nOfficials in some of those states refused to comment on how they would respond , citing the ongoing Supreme Court case . `` I 'm just not going to speculate on what the court may or may not do , '' said Kansas Gov . Sam Brownback .\nThings might be different in California , Colorado , Oregon , Pennsylvania and Virginia because top elected officials did not contest lower-court rulings in favor of same-sex marriage . Courts in those states issued orders , or injunctions , that forbid the state from enforcing the constitutional amendments or state laws that limit marriage to a man and a woman .\nTypically , a participant in the lawsuit that led to the injunction has to ask the judge to undo it . But if the governor and attorney general are same-sex marriage supporters , they may have little incentive to go back into court . In California , for instance , Gov . Jerry Brown and Attorney General Kamala Harris both opposed Proposition 8 , the state constitutional amendment that prohibited same-sex marriage . `` I think it 's very unlikely that anyone would try to turn back the clock in California , '' Stoll said .\nBut Gene Schaerr , a Washington-based lawyer who has defended same-sex marriage bans , said he thinks even in states where the political leadership favors gay and lesbian unions , county clerks who actually issue marriage licenses would be on safe ground if they were to deny licenses to same-sex couples .\nIn Schaerr 's view , only the clerks in Alameda and Los Angeles counties are bound by the 2010 injunction issued by U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker . A Supreme Court ruling rejecting a constitutional right to marry for same-sex couples would `` free the clerks in counties other than Los Angeles and Alameda to adhere to Proposition 8 , '' Schaerr said .\nColorado Attorney General Cynthia Coffman , a Republican , said she supports same-sex marriage , but believes voters need to remove the marriage ban from the state constitution — and would replace it with legal protection for same-sex marriage if given the chance . Coffman said she would `` gladly defend '' such an outcome .\nIf same-sex marriages cease in Virginia , Attorney General Mark Herring would try to get the state General Assembly to repeal the state 's statutory and constitutional bans , Herring spokesman Michael Kelly said .\nSome gay rights groups and state officials said the chance the court would not come out in favor of same-sex marriage is remote .\n`` Recent history of the past eight months , plus all the rulings of the past 20 years , do n't indicate that to us this is going to go against us , '' said Tom Witt , executive director of gay rights organization Equality Kansas . `` It could , but a giant meteor could fall on my head in the next five seconds .

You see it in Revenge of the Nerds , when the dorks switch places with the jocks on the campus totem pole to the sound of “ We Are the Champions . ”\nLife imitated art , this week , as detractors of The Donald dismissed his deal to keep Carrier , which announced a move to Mexico earlier this year , in Indiana .\n“ I think it ’ s all a PR move , ” Chuck Jones , president of United Steelworkers Local 1999 , maintained last week of negotiations , adding , “ I ’ d be shocked if anything was done . ”\nBut something got done . Not airy promises to usher in “ the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal , ” but concrete action occurred to save actual jobs worked by actual people .\n“ Companies are not going to leave the United States anymore without consequences , ” Trump announced at the air-conditioner plant on Thursday . That ’ s another way of saying that you can no longer drink from the federal trough , as you piss on the people who fill it . United Technologies , Carrier ’ s parent company , derives about $ 6 billion in revenue from the federal government .\nCiting deregulation and a push to decrease corporate taxes from 35 to 15 percent , the president-elect added a carrot to his stick , informing : “ I just want to let all of the other companies know we ’ re going to do great things for business . There ’ s no reason to leave anymore . ”\nBut saving 1,100 jobs before taking the oath of office failed to impress the pfft people .\n“ He is partially following through on a campaign promise , but this is not stemming the flow of offshoring in the United States , ” Ryan Lizza said on CNN . “ I don ’ t think Donald Trump is the first president to visit factories , ” David Gergen felt compelled to point out , adding : “ One thing this whole tableau does not address is the impact of automation . ”\n“ It is not good enough to save some of these jobs , ” Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-Vermont ) complained . “ Trump made a promise that he would save all of these jobs , and we can not rest until an ironclad contract is signed to ensure that all of these workers are able to continue working in Indiana without having their pay or benefits slashed . ”\nThe senator took 704 words in the Washington Post to say one onomatopoeia : pfft .\nTrump ’ s predecessor failed to drop the dime to save these jobs , during his last year in office . Trump , not yet on the federal payroll , did so before day one . That ’ s nothing to pfft at .\nThe pfft people demonstrate a sore-loser , rule-or-ruin attitude of the kind they accused Republicans of harboring after Sen. Mitch McConnell ( R-Kentucky ) in 2010 said , “ The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president. ” Some Democrats embody the trait they charged Republicans of displaying not so long ago . In booing when Americans cheer the president-elect winning back more than a thousand jobs , they cast themselves as losers . More so , they showed how petty political hatred clouds judgment .\nUnion members , many of them Democrats , received an early Christmas gift from the president-elect . Partisan Scrooges say , “ Humbug ! ”\nClassmates voting for Pedro surely displeased Summer Wheatley .

    "429": "The press is abuzz with the latest element in the left-wing conspiracy theory that Donald Trump is secretly a Russian agent .\nThe New York Times reports that Trump ’ s campaign chair , Paul Manafort , is listed in a “ secret ledger ” showing payments from the former , Russia-friendly , Ukrainian government . The fact that Hillary Clinton ’ s campaign chair , left-wing George Soros agent John Podesta , helped a Russian government-linked company bag $ 35 million — an actual , bigger scandal — is ignored .\nFirst of all , it is not clear what the Times story shows , because the Times spends so much time undermining its own case .\nPaul Manafort consulted for the Ukrainian ruling party , and helped it win elections . Manafort was listed in a handwritten ledger as having received money from that same party . The Times can not say if he received the money ; notes that Ukrainian investigators “ have yet to determine if he actually received the cash ” ; adds that “ the purpose of the payments is not clear ” ; reports that Manafort “ is not a target ” in a separate investigation into offshore dealings by the former regime ; and admits that it is “ unclear ” whether Manafort would have had to register with the U.S. government as a foreign agent .\nAll the Times has is what is already known about Manafort : namely , he advised an unsavory regime , and was paid handsomely for his services .\nIt is an unfortunate fact of political life that senior operatives on both sides have side gigs working as lobbyists , sometimes for foreign governments — and sometimes nasty ones .\nIn 2008 , Sen. John McCain ( R-AZ ) tried to cut lobbyists from his campaign staff to set an example ; then-Sen. Barack Obama ( D-IL ) ran on a “ no lobbyist ” pledge that he violated even before he took the oath of office . Even the left-leaning PolitiFact named the no-lobbyist pledge a “ broken promise ” by Obama . In 2015 , ███ broke the story that a former employee of a pro-Iran lobby group was advising the White House as the Iran deal was being negotiated , meaning that the ayatollahs had people on both sides of the table . The media largely shrugged .\nIt is certainly possible that Manafort was involved in corrupt dealings with the old Ukrainian regime . But the Times does not actually prove that . Instead , it throws enough innuendo into the article to associate Manafort with the old regime ’ s excesses — and to stoke the conspiracy theory of Russian control of Trump .\nKeep in mind that Trump ’ s opponent not only pushed the “ reset ” button with the Putin regime in an effort to establish closer ties , but also presided over a nuclear disarmament treaty that slashed America ’ s nuclear arsenal while leaving Russia ’ s weapons largely intact ; abandoned American missile defense programs in Europe to appease Russia , undercutting our Eastern European allies in the process ; allowed a Putin-controlled company to acquire 20 % of U.S. supplies of uranium , after a timely donation to the Clinton Foundation ; and encouraged American tech companies to invest in a Russian project that was likely used to improve Russian defense and espionage .\nThe fact that the media are obsessing about what is still , at this stage , a flimsy conspiracy theory about Russian ties to the Trump campaign , while largely ignoring the overt record of appeasement and explicit commercial ties between the Clinton campaign and the Putin regime , says more about media bias than it does about the business dealings of Paul Manafort .\nJoel B.

Deace compared Cruz to Clint Eastwood — after candidates who were “ nice ” did nothing to stop America ’ s decline , the country , especially conservative primary voters , may want a vigilante sheriff like Cruz .\nAt the Family Leadership Summit , Cruz discussed some of the many brawls he has been in on behalf of conservatives and some of the victories conservatives have had on Second Amendment and religious liberty issues . He vowed to repeal “ every word ” of Obamacare and abolish the IRS , while denouncing Common Core . He emphasized that the House ’ s border bill , which prevented President Barack Obama from using federal funds to enact more executive amnesty , is a deterrent against more illegal immigration .\nAs he said at the state fair , Cruz blasted Obama ’ s foreign policy by talking about the “ the Obama diet ” that he said is popular in D.C .\n“ It ’ s very simple , ” he said . “ You just let Putin eat your lunch every day . ”\nAfter Cruz spoke at the Des Moines Register soapbox event , he reportedly called Obama “ an absentee president ” for not visiting the border when Obama was in Texas fundraising and said he should stop playing golf during various crises .\n“ I think the president should actually stand up and do his job as commander in chief , should spend less time on the golf course and more time doing the job to which he was elected , ” Cruz said , according to ABC News .\nAt the fair , Cruz was wowed by the famous butter cow , showed his support for Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst , and enjoyed a pork chop on a stick . The Iowa State Fair , he said , is one place where “ pork doesn ’ t bankrupt America . ”\nOther potential presidential candidates like Rand Paul , Rick Perry , Rick Santorum and even Ben Carson will be playing in the so-called invisible primary in Iowa this month .\nMeeting w grassroots leaders from across the State of Iowa before speaking at The Family Leadership Summit # FLS2014 pic.twitter.com/2XNzAb6tju — Team Cruz ( @ TeamTedCruz ) August 9 , 2014\nWow , a cow made of butter .

    "432": "“ It makes me mildly nauseous to think that we might have had some impact on the election , ” FBI Director James Comey testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee less than two weeks ago . Hearing Comey supercilious testimony , made me , well , mildly nauseous .\nMr. Comey was speaking about his unilateral decision to publicly reopen the investigation of Hillary Clinton on October 29 , just ten days before the election . That pre-election announcement and the specter of evil Russians are why Hillary lost , we are told ( by Hillary ) . Let ’ s forget her lack of appeal , her disconnect with much of America , her inept campaign , especially her dissing of Michigan and Wisconsin .\n“ But honestly , it [ the alleged Comey effect on the election outcome ] wouldn ’ t change the decision [ I made ] , ” Comey added . Indeed , in his ultimate chutzpah-hubris , Comey also refused to recant his preposterous news conference of July 5 . At that time he had provided all the reasons why Hillary should be indicted and prosecuted and then , usurping the role of the Department of Justice , Comey violated historic protocols and , in a non-sequitur for the history books , gave her a get-out-of-jail-free card .\nThat was then , this is now . If you believe the media , Trump ’ s firing of Comey somehow threatens the rule of law , though Trump had the right to fire him . The same Democrats who repeatedly and strongly urged that Comey be fired , condemn Trump for “ the suspicious timing. ” The patronizing Adam Schiff , arguably the most pompous member of Congress , said the reason for the firing was Trump ’ s alleged ties to Russia . A former prosecutor who knows better , Schiff routinely makes charges without proof , but he does so with gravitas .\n“ Comey was fired because of the Russians , ” also observed Pocahontas , aka Sen. Elizabeth Warren , perennially self-righteous . Warren became a professor at Harvard Law School because she described herself as of Cherokee and Delaware Indian ancestry ; she is neither . Of dubious credibility , she joins the chorus : “ We need a special prosecutor ! ” Over more than four decades , “ special ” prosecutors have acted like IRS agents who , after an exhaustive taxpayer audit , find nothing . But to validate their time , the agents nonetheless pressure the taxpayer into a “ settlement. ” In other words , if a special prosecutor finds no crimes related to Trump and “ the Russians , ” he will ask for an expanded budget and prosecute someone connected to Trump… for something .\n“ He ’ s a showboat , a grandstander , ” Trump has said of Comey . Trump ’ s detractors would say , “ It takes one to know one. ” But Trump got it right . Comey became ( per Simon Cowell ) “ self-indulgent. ” His firing was overdue , yet with no expiration date .\nBut Trump ’ s dismissal of Comey was awkward ; let us count the ways .\nTrump ’ s senior staff remains dysfunctional , evidenced by self-serving leaks from rivals , not all of them Trump ’ s fiduciaries . Intent on discharging Comey , Trump thus feared premature ejaculation . Avoiding tactical if not strategic proofreading , Trump seemed to act not deliberatively ( i.e. , presidential ) , but impulsively ; then oddly , he seemed to be genuinely surprised at the uproar . He and his team would evolve a contradictory and implausible narrative . Even Vice President Mike Pence continually said President Trump “ showed leadership ” by acting quickly after reading Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein ’ s memorandum faulting Comey ’ s performance , but then President Trump said he had already made up his mind to fire Comey . Everyone should have been on the same page , from the outset , but no one knew the page number , much less what was on it .\nSpicer , President Trump more recently said , is “ doing a good job but he gets beat up. ” In reality , Spicer and his deputy Sarah Huckabee Sanders can not do their job if the storyline keeps changing , and especially if Spicer does not have access to Trump before airtime . Now Trump says he works so fast that White House briefings are obsolete . But in firing Comey , the dictum should have been , “ This is my story , and I ’ m sticking to it . ”\nDeputy AG Rod Rosenstein ’ s memorandum to AG Jeff Sessions made the case for Comey ’ s dismissal . But it was dated the same day that Sessions then ( immediately ? ) wrote to POTUS who then ( straightaway ? ) wrote Comey ’ s farewell , and ( without pausing ? ) dispatched his long-time personal aide to deliver that termination letter to Comey . Except that Comey had flown on the FBI jet to Los Angeles , the sanctuary city where you press “ 2 ” if you want to hear a city message in English ( just kidding ) . Here leaders are passing a municipal decree to implant the scarlet letter on any minor subcontractor on Trump ’ s wall ( not kidding ) . The politically correct Comey was at the Los Angeles FBI field office , speaking to agents not about such trivial matters as terrorism or cyber warfare , but the far more urgent matter of diversity . As Comey spoke , the agents saw the news of his firing on a television screen behind the needlessly humiliated Comey .\nLet ’ s now talk Russia . All we know ( so far ) suggests that Putin preferred Trump to Hillary , and that the Russians hacked Hillary ’ s campaign to hurt her . No evidence suggests collusion or complicity between Trump and his campaign… and Putin and his operatives , nor acts that are illegal . Yet , as one observer noted , “ Trump seems to act like he ’ s guilty. ” Meanwhile , the mainstream media has kept the Russia story alive , because its agenda is to question the legitimacy of Trump ’ s election . Major media outlets repeatedly relate gossip as fact . For example , Comey supposedly asked for more money to investigate Trump , who then sacked him . But this turned out to be fake news . The real news , the media reported last week , is that Trump is served two scoops of ice cream for dessert , while his White House guests get only one . CNN noted that Abby Grace , age 9 , who lives next door to Comey in McLean , Virginia baked him chocolate chip cookies to cheer him up .\nThere is no evidence to suggest that Trump ’ s dismissal of Comey was to “ obstruct ” the FBI investigation ; it continues , with no shortage of agents or budget . If Trump were trying to shut down the investigation , firing Comey guaranteed it will continue , robustly , and all eyes will focus on Comey ’ s successor , who will be under pressure , in confirmation hearings , and on the job , to insure an independent investigation .\nHere ’ s what probably happened . Trump has become increasingly agitated because : ( a ) Comey did not move the FBI “ Russia ” investigation toward closure , but made it open-ended ; ( b ) Comey is a loose cannon , which is different than being independent ; ( c ) Comey showed little inclination to investigate illegal leaks by government officials intent on subverting the Trump presidency ; and , most egregiously : ( d ) Comey implied that Trump ’ s reelection made Comey nauseous .\nThere was no good time to fire Comey , but there was a better way . Ask the respected Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein to prepare his memo ; wait at least a day for AG Jeff Sessions to react , then on the third day either give Comey a chance to resign , or fire him , but do so privately . Already have a list of possible replacements , then interview them , all within 72 hours of Comey ’ s firing , and appoint his successor a day after the last interview , to make the FBI Director the story and Comey “ old news . ”\nThe rationale for Comey ’ s firing should have been that Comey ’ s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee was unacceptable , especially his intransigent refusal to acknowledge his bad judgment last year . Therefore , the president , who has for a couple of weeks been pondering Mr. Comey ’ s future , now accepts the deputy attorney general conclusion , spurred by the testimony . And similarly , President Trump lacks confidence in Comey , so he can no longer serve as Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation . Talking points should have been developed before Comey ’ s dismissal .\nIn this drama , some of the principals may be vulnerable to prosecution . From what we know , Gen. Mike Flynn may have violated some laws relating to disclosure to government agencies . But Mike Flynn is no longer with the administration . And by all accounts , Flynn also failed to disclose material information to candidate Trump and his campaign . Paul Manafort , whose foreign clients included Russian proxies , was asked by Trump to oversee the convention after Ted Cruz was using the rules to pick up delegates . But Manafort was dismissed soon after the convention . And Roger Stone , another alleged link to the Russians , has joyfully volunteered to testify publicly , without immunity . That ’ s not what guilty conspirators do .\nAll this raises the question of context . If President Donald Trump is the “ Manchurian candidate ” — then why was Donald Trump so obvious about it during the campaign ? That is , if Trump were a covert operative for Putin , why would he go public about it in his campaign , praising Putin and urging rapprochement with Russia ? In other words , if the Russians influenced or bribed Donald Trump and his sons , Donald Jr. and Eric , with loans and business deals , why not wait until after Trump becomes president to embrace Putin and Russia ? Why tip your hand throughout the campaign ?\nThe answer is not elusive , because we can observe the Trump Administration . President Trump ’ s principal foreign policy appointments have been unsympathetic to Putin . Hardliners in the U.S. Senate do not detect softness in U.S. policy toward Russia . Trump seems reassuring of our NATO allies that the U.S. will join NATO to resist regional Russian aggression . The U.S. is confronting Russian air incursions , especially near Alaska . And in Putin ’ s most dramatic foreign adventure — in Syria — President Trump ordered a symbolic air strike against Putin ’ s proxy , Bashar Assad . Is all this a head-fake ? I think not .\nBut at the end of the day , what counts is perception , not reality . Perhaps one-third of the nation sees Trump as some kind of savior . And maybe another third is comprised of unrepentant Trump haters . That leaves a likely third of the nation that is increasingly restless with drama , instead of policy . And the latest episode is the James Comey soap opera .\nPutin said something like , “ Once a KGB guy , always a KGB guy. ” The KGB has placed within the U.S. government over the years a number of home-grown operatives , via blackmail , or by providing sexual favors or money , or feeding their ego . Some of these moles have simply been dupes . What we know is that the KGB would not discredit them in advance . If President Trump was sympathetic toward better relations with Russia , not because he was complicit with Russia , but because he thought it was in the best interest of the U.S. , why would President Trump obsess about such a policy , if it would discredit that policy in advance ? He was quite transparent about his views .\nIndeed , the disposition of President Trump ’ s policy toward Russia is this : his campaign pronouncements have put him and his administration on the spot . If anything , he may now go overboard in demonstrating “ firmness ” and “ toughness ” against Putin and Russia . And similarly , given the sacking of Comey , what happens now with the FBI — can it be seen as “ soft ” on investigating “ Trump and Russia ” — whatever that means ?\nSooner than later , perhaps imminently , President Donald Trump will name a new FBI director . For his sake , and more importantly for the nation , let ’ s hope he avoids a partisan . If he chooses a man or woman of unquestionable integrity and demonstrated judgment who pledges to be independent of politics , President Trump will implicitly refute the challenge to his legitimacy . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

    "435": "“ Trump has betrayed the Syrian Kurds ” — so goes a popular refrain regarding the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the areas of northeast Syria held by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces ( SDF ) . The events that have followed — namely , a Turkish invasion of parts of SDF territory along the border and the deployment of Syrian government forces in some SDF areas — have been characterized as a strategic disaster for American interests , with some commentators even proclaiming the withdrawal as indicative of a U.S. imperial decline and U.S. disengagement from the Middle East .\nIn fact , much of this is overblown . For one thing , the U.S. still maintains extensive troop deployments elsewhere in the Middle East , and those are not being drawn down anytime soon . Insofar as many of the pundits , analysts , and policymakers condemning Trump consider the recent developments in Syria to be a disaster , they primarily have themselves to blame , however popular bashing Trump might be .\nIndeed , these critics of Trump did not learn the relevant lessons from December 2018 when the president ordered preparations for a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria . They should have appreciated that Trump is ultimately the commander-in-chief of the U.S. armed forces and that he had made his own preferences on Syria clear : namely , that after the military defeat of the Islamic State , U.S. forces should leave . As the president ’ s record on issues like climate change and the Iran nuclear deal illustrates , he has generally been forthright and sincere in trying to fulfill his policy promises . When he told his advisers that he wanted to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria , he meant it . The message should have been clear : devise an orderly withdrawal plan .\nBut that is not what happened . Instead , efforts and attention were geared towards U.S. forces remaining indefinitely in Syria . The advocates for this “ stay indefinitely ” approach argued that the deployment as it existed was supposedly an example of a successful projection of U.S. leverage and influence with a relatively small number of troops . They claimed that U.S. presence was vital for political negotiations on Syria ’ s future and important for limiting Iranian influence and blocking its “ land route ” to the Mediterranean .\nIn reality , none of these assertions holds up but rather reflect dubious expansions of the original purpose of the U.S. mission in Syria : countering the Islamic State . At the same time , the “ stay indefinitely ” crowd tended to downplay the major problem regarding the U.S. partnership with the SDF : the issue of relations with Turkey , which considers ( with some justification ) the SDF to be an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) , which has fought the Turkish state for decades .\nRegardless of what one thinks of Turkey ’ s approach towards the PKK , it is not a problem that can be treated as a minor irritant . Facts of geography mean that Turkey is located along the northern borders of the SDF ’ s territory . As such , Turkey could be the SDF ’ s main gateway to the outside world , rather than the small and limited capacity border crossing on the Tigris River that the SDF has maintained with the Iraqi Kurdistan region . Thus , for the interests of the SDF ’ s longterm economic prospects ( among other things ) , some kind of détente or resolution of the conflict between the PKK and Turkey would have been necessary so that the region could have much more open borders and engagement with the outside world .\nUnfortunately , though , policymakers and advisers did not take Turkey ’ s concerns and its threats of a military confrontation with the SDF seriously enough . Along with their desire to keep U.S. troops in Syria , many of them imagined that Turkey could somehow be appeased through half-baked measures : thus the previous attempts to deny SDF–PKK links , the failed schemes of joint U.S.–Turkish patrols in the Manbij area west of the Euphrates River , and then the joint northern border patrols and partial dismantling of SDF fortifications along the northern border with Turkey a little while before the recent Turkish incursion against the SDF .\nOthers argue that the U.S. simply needed to be adamant in saying no to a Turkish incursion and that the small U.S. troop presence could have deterred Turkey indefinitely . This view is implausible . A small foreign troop presence can function as a deterrent to another side ’ s attack , but it is not an absolute deterrent here . To understand why , consider events that occurred earlier this year on the other side of Syria . In the northwest of Syria ( specifically the city of Idlib and its environs ) , Turkey set up multiple small military outposts in the insurgent-held areas ostensibly as part of enforcing a “ deescalation ” scheme in coordination with Russia . In practice , the goal has been to block any further Syrian government offensives on the northwest and prevent further refugee flows into Turkey .\nWhile Russia has shown some understanding of Turkey ’ s concerns in this regard , it also wishes to assist the Syrian government in restoring its control over the area and will not tolerate the indefinite presence of designated “ terrorist ” groups harassing Syrian government and Russian positions . Russia thus gave Turkey time to clear a demilitarized buffer zone of the likes of Hay ’ at Tahrir al-Sham ( a designated “ terrorist ” group ) . When that did not materialize and the insurgent harassments of Syrian government and Russian positions continued , the Syrian government and Russia launched a military campaign that retook important areas in south Idlib and north Hama . The Turkish military outposts did not do anything to stop the offensive ( indeed , they could not do so ) , and in effect the Syrian government and Russia worked around one of the outposts in north Hama . A ceasefire then followed , but it should be clear that it will not last if Turkey can not crack down on the groups that are designated as “ terrorist . ”\nThat episode should also have been a lesson for U.S. policymakers . Turkey ’ s president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan repeatedly said he would launch an incursion against the SDF to the east of the Euphrates River ( where U.S. forces in Syria have primarily been stationed ) , and in 2018 Turkey had carried through with its threats to destroy the SDF enclave in the Afrin area , where the U.S. had no presence . What would have stopped Turkey from finding ways to work around U.S. positions as part of its incursion against the SDF east of the Euphrates River and essentially forcing the small U.S. garrisons — confronted by much larger Turkish forces and their Syrian insurgent proxies — to get out of the way ?\nThus , Trump ’ s indication to Erdoğan that he wished to leave Syria and would not oppose an incursion likely hastened the Turkish operations against the SDF . But it was not the decisive factor in determining whether or not those operations would have eventually occurred anyway . Had the U.S. wished to deter Turkey indefinitely , it would have had to deploy far more troops in northeast Syria . For comparison , the much more extensive Turkish military presence in the insurgent-held north Aleppo countryside between Afrin and Jarabulus functions as an effective deterrent against Russian and Syrian government military action so long as Turkey maintains that large presence .\nOf course , the advocates of the “ stay indefinitely ” course did not dare to confront these realities and argue for a more extensive U.S. presence , knowing that such advocacy would be politically unacceptable . They preferred to argue that the small U.S. troop presence in northeast Syria as an example of a deployment that was strategically effective and inexpensive .\nUltimately , the debate about the U.S. role in Syria boils down to the question of how far the U.S. should invest troops and resources into a foreign deployment . Those who advocated an indefinite presence are delusional if they think the prior status quo was sustainable . If they had thought more carefully about the idea of making the SDF-held areas a U.S. protectorate that could function independently of the wider environment , they should have accepted that such a project would have required far more troops and money to be poured in .\nIn any case , they should still be asked why they did not come up with an exit plan but instead thought they could defy the president ’ s wishes . They are the ones far more deserving of the accusation of betrayal for making misleading commitments , promises , and reassurances to the SDF . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "436": "Inspector General ( IG ) Michael Horowitz testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday , making crystal clear what he wrote in his report : The FBI investigation into the 2016 Trump campaign 's possible collusion with Russia was not politically motivated , but agents involved in the probe made significant and appalling mistakes .\nThese mistakes should terrify all Americans .

I 'm glad some Republicans are apparently reconsidering their reflexive trust of the FBI , but clearly they still have a long way to go .\nThat 's true as well for the mainstream media , which for far too long has given undeserved credit to Trump-critical law enforcement figures like former FBI Directors James Comey and Andrew McCabe . Both have been lionized on cable news and in newspapers . They were routinely labeled brave truth-tellers who took serious personal risks to call out wrongdoing within the administration .\nMany of their criticisms of the Trump administration may have been well-founded . But under Comey 's watch , the FBI made major errors . Comey and McCabe were directly involved in the decision to rely on the Steele dossier—a decision that the CIA had serious concerns about . Comey later misled the public about the extent of the FBI 's reliance on the dossier . Indeed , many in the mainstream media had previously claimed that the dossier was not the only basis for the FBI 's interest in Page , because they uncritically believed what the G-men were telling them . We now know that 's wrong—the Steele dossier was the FBI 's key piece of evidence .\nComey is still trying to spin the IG 's report as some kind of vindication . This is delusional and embarrassing . If the media learns anything from this episode , it should be that the fact that Team Trump has ostracized an insufficiently deferential public servant is not enough of a ███ to embrace him as a hero and a savior .\nThe IG report is a wakeup call : for Republicans who foolishly claimed the FBI 's secretive spying process was necessary and unthreatening , for anti-Trump media pundits who uncritically parroted the talking points of top officials , and for any Americans who still think it is worth trading away their liberties . If government agents were this sloppy during a politically charged investigation that they knew would put their entire apparatus under the spotlight , it 's safe to assume their normal conduct is even worse . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "437": "The U.S. Senate majority leader said Sunday he would not schedule a vote to confirm President Barack Obama 's nominee for attorney general , Loretta Lynch , until Democrats stop blocking an unrelated human trafficking bill .\nRepublican Senator Mitch McConnell told CNN 's `` State of the Union '' program he had planned to take up Lynch 's nomination this week but may put it off if an anti-human trafficking measure does not pass first .\nDemocrats last week objected to anti-abortion provisions in that bill , which is otherwise widely supported . But McConnell said the language had been part of the legislation all along , including when it was approved unanimously by the Judiciary Committee .\n`` This will have an impact of the timing of considering a new attorney general , '' McConnell said . `` I had hoped to turn to her next week but if we ca n't finish the trafficking bill she will be put off again . ''\nPolitico reported Sunday that the delay could jeopardize Lynch 's confirmation and possibly damage both parties .\nThe GOP might become viewed as holding up a history-making nomination . It also could give Republicans who are on the fence about Lynch an opportunity to vote against her , setting her up for confirmation by the smallest margin in history , Politico says .\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee on Feb. 26 voted in favor of Lynch to replace Attorney General Eric Holder , clearing the way for her expected confirmation in the full Senate .\nBut even the committee vote had fallen victim to partisan bickering . Senate Republicans delayed a scheduled vote on her nomination last month to scrutinize Lynch 's record , in particular her support of the Obama administration 's executive actions on immigration .\n`` I think the attorney general nominee is suffering from the president 's actions , there 's no question about it , '' McConnell said . McConnell said Obama 's immigration orders , which provided a pathway to legal status for millions of undocumented Americans , enraged many senators .\nAt her Jan. 28 confirmation hearing , Lynch sought to smooth interactions with Republicans , who have repeatedly clashed with Holder .\nSince the hearing , a Texas district court has thrown Obama 's executive order on immigration into legal limbo . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "438": "In 2004 , after the open secularism of John Kerry sunk his chances of defeating George W. Bush , it became briefly popular in Democratic circles to talk about renewed outreach to “ values voters. ” Bill Clinton had advised Kerry to fake up opposition to gay marriage in Ohio , but Kerry rejected his counsel , saying he didn ’ t want to appear “ intolerant. ” Even liberal Democrats like Nancy Pelosi browbeat Kerry for adopting a strategy that excluded the religious . “ Certainly Democrats are faith-filled , ” she said , “ but somehow or other that did not come across when 61 % of those who are regular churchgoers voted Republican . ”\nOut of these complaints came various con jobs : Hillary Clinton for a time revived her husband ’ s “ safe , legal , and rare ” hedging about abortion ( which vanished during her 2016 run ) , Barack Obama delivered windy “ post-partisan ” speeches about a “ new ” relationship between politics and religion , “ chaplains ” would pop up at Democratic events to try and give a religious flavor to the proceedings , “ people of faith ” tabs were added to party Web pages , and so on .\nBut it didn ’ t take long for secularized Dems to grow tired of the posturing . By 2012 , liberals had pressured Obama into giving up his phony temporizing about gay marriage and were demanding that any mention of God be stripped from the party ’ s platform . At its convention in Charlotte that year , delegates booed after party hacks restored the deleted line about God .\nObama , even as declared that America is “ not a Christian nation ” and persecuted the Little Sisters of the Poor and other religious groups , kept up his quasi-religious uplift and his attempts to shoehorn Scripture into this or that progressive cause . But it was all a charade , which has now been confirmed by his own 2012 “ faith-outreach ” director , Michael Wear .\nWear has said that he almost quit after Obama dropped a pastor from his Inauguration for disagreeing with the Democratic line on gay marriage . In an interview with the Atlantic , Wear unloads on the Democrats for their indifference to Christians .\nAsked why Trump swept evangelicals , he responded , “ Liberals have been trying to convince Americans , and evangelicals in particular , that America is not a Christian nation . The 2016 election was evangelicals saying , ‘ Yeah , you ’ re right ! We can ’ t expect to have someone who is Christian like us . We can ’ t expect to have someone with a perfect family life . What we can expect is someone who can look out for us , just like every other group in this country is looking for a candidate who will look out for them . ’ ”\nWear acknowledges that the party is staffed by secularists for whom Christianity is an annoying impediment to their policy agenda and culturally incomprehensible : “ …there ’ s a religious illiteracy problem in the Democratic Party . It ’ s tied to the demographics of the country : More 20- and 30-year-olds are taking positions of power in the Democratic Party . They grew up in parts of the country where navigating religion was not important socially and not important to their political careers. ” When Wear once tried to sprinkle a little Scripture into a faith-outreach document for Obama , White House staffers were too clueless to catch the reference , wondering what he meant by the “ least of these. ” He got an edit back from a White House official , saying , “ Is this a typo ? It doesn ’ t make any sense to me . Who/what are ‘ these ’ ? ”\nWear ’ s comments are likely to generate nothing but a shrug from Democrats , who recognize that the party ’ s commitment to secularism , moral relativism , and Islamophilia are too deep to permit any serious Judeo-Christian outreach . To Wear or Alan Dershowitz , the message from the party is essentially the same : The exits of the party are clearly marked . The Dems have become the party of transgender bathrooms and Ramadan dinners , which explains why Congressman Keith Ellison is even in the running to head up the Democratic National Committee . Ties to the Nation of Islam are less fatal to a Democratic leader ’ s career than mild opposition to abortion or gay marriage .\nIn 2008 , Obama played the pensive pol , pretending to care “ about how to reconcile ” America ’ s Judeo-Christian traditions “ with our modern , pluralistic democracy. ” He was advising his party not to moderate its positions but its rhetoric — a balancing act in which he quickly lost interest . He spent eight years in effect calling Christians bigots .\nThe door to the party for them had few cracks in it anyways , but Obama made sure to slam it shut , and it is too late to open it again . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "439": "In George Washington ’ s 1796 farewell address , he argued that of “ all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity , religion and morality are indispensable supports. ” In Barack Obama ’ s farewell address , he congratulated himself for undermining them .\nHe identified America ’ s progress in the diminution of its historic religion and morality and urged Americans to embrace greater and greater departures from them . The country ’ s future , he said , depends upon welcoming Islam and the transgendered , among other favored groups , and eschewing “ discrimination , ” his catch-all term for any lingering conservatism in the country .\nAt one point , he even tried to turn George Washington into a fellow progressive , ignoring the aforementioned quote for a dubious paraphrase designed to make Washington sound like a diversity-conscious liberal : “ In his own farewell address , George Washington wrote that self-government is the underpinning of our safety , prosperity , and liberty , but ‘ from different causes and from different quarters much pains will be taken… to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth ’ ; that we should preserve it with ‘ jealous anxiety ’ ; that we should reject ‘ the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest or to enfeeble the sacred ties ’ that make us one . ”\nActually , Washington argued in his farewell address that self-government is dangerous if disconnected from conservative principles . He feared the intoxicated modern smugness that the spirit of the budding Enlightenment threatened to unleash on the country . He warned that the abandonment of religion and morality , in the name of a self-sufficient humanism , would lead to a vicious and decadent citizenry and tyrannical government . Disorder would replace order , with whoever is in power preying upon those without power .\nHis worst fears have been realized in Obama ’ s “ fundamentally transformed ” America , where judges , bureaucrats , and pols liberated from the constraints of religion and morality invent bogus rights that collide with God-given ones , starting with the right to life of unborn children .\nThe liberalism that Obama espouses is essentially an attempt to construct a society without religion and morality , one that is based not on traditional wisdom but upon the “ enlightenment ” of whoever is in power . Washington smelled a rat in the “ refined ” conceits of the Enlightenment . He asked in his farewell address — “ [ W ] here is the security for property , for reputation , for life , if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths , which are the instruments of investigation in Courts of Justice ? ” — and rejected the idea “ that morality can be maintained without religion. ” He correctly predicted that “ national morality ” would suffer “ in exclusion of religious principle . ”\nBarack Obama gave his farewell address not in George Washington ’ s capital , but in the friendlier confines of Saul Alinsky ’ s Chicago , though the noise of a protester marred the start of his speech . He described his accomplishments as “ two steps forward one step back , ” but the title of Lenin ’ s pamphlet , “ One Step Forward , Two Steps Back , ” would have been more apt . To the end , he was the Bolshie community organizer , peppering his speech with repeated calls to hit the streets and “ organize . ”\nHe spoke of “ change ” as the glory of America , but the theme of hope got shorter shrift . At times he sounded a bit hopeless , saying bleakly , “ After my election , there was talk of a post-racial America . Such a vision , however well-intended , was never realistic. ” But his spirit revived when he contemplated that today ’ s minorities might be tomorrow ’ s majorities .\nThe implicit treatment of Trump in the speech was passive-aggressive , at once conceding his points and caricaturing them . At one moment , Obama was acknowledging the need for “ fair trade ” ; in the next , he was dismissing it as irrelevant . He worked in a few references to the white working class but quickly followed them up with a demagogic spin on Trumpism : “ After all , if every economic issue is framed as a struggle between a hardworking white middle class and undeserving minorities , then workers of all shades will be left fighting for scraps while the wealthy withdraw further into their private enclaves . If we decline to invest in the children of immigrants , just because they don ’ t look like us , we diminish the prospects of our own children — because those brown kids will represent a larger share of America ’ s workforce . ”\nThe speech was a jumble of platitudes and self-serving tips on how to run a democracy ( get out of your “ bubble , ” talk to people with whom you disagree , and so on ) , ostensibly directed to all Americans but really only intended for Trump and conservatives . The crowd roared when he said that “ reason and science matter , ” as if he had delivered a devastating riposte to the right . He talked about “ facts ” and “ information ” as the hallmarks of sane politics as if liberalism enjoys ownership over them , and “ decency ” of course was equated with support for “ marriage equality , ” a phrase that would have puzzled George Washington .\nTo the extent that the speech descended into specifics , it ignored America ’ s most pressing problems while manufacturing and obsessing over imaginary ones , with climate change topping the list . “ In just eight years , we ’ ve halved our dependence on foreign oil , doubled our renewable energy , and led the world to an agreement that has the promise to save this planet , ” he said . The Greek columns were gone from behind him , but he still sees himself as a demigod who can control the oceans . He continued , “ But without bolder action , our children won ’ t have time to debate the existence of climate change ; they ’ ll be busy dealing with its effects : environmental disasters , economic disruptions , and waves of climate refugees seeking sanctuary . ”\nThere was a lot of strutting and fist-pumping , but all of it couldn ’ t conceal that Obama leaves his party in ruins . It was a farewell address as hollow and delusional as his presidency . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "440": "I can not wait to learn more about the identity and motives of the secret whistleblower who figures so prominently in stories of Trump ’ s phone call with the newly elected Ukrainian president . The narrative that began a month ago , as an insider ’ s accusation of Trump ’ s threat to cut off U.S. military aid unless investigations were launched into his expected opponent Joe Biden , has evolved considerably .\nIt now appears — in spite of initial denials — that the whistleblower consulted with House Intelligence Committee ( HIC ) staff before filing his complaint — and was advised immediately to obtain counsel . Somehow , the chosen counsel was part of a whistleblower search organization , whose staff had previously worked with HIC chairman Adam Schiff ( D-Calif. ) . While the whistleblower ’ s complaint was based entirely on secondhand hearsay — which was explicitly precluded under existing reporting rules — those rules were changed after the complaint ’ s receipt so as to do away with the requirement of firsthand knowledge .\nWhat began as an admission that the whistleblower worked for the CIA and was a registered Democrat was accompanied by the absolute assurance that he was not an active partisan and had not worked in any current presidential campaign . That assurance now seems to be evolving into a situation in which the whistleblower had been assigned to the National Security Council , where he worked with former Vice President Biden — and may even have traveled with him on one or more trips to Ukraine .\nWords are being chosen quite carefully , and the truth seems more and more elusive , as Republican HIC members continue to be kept in the dark . One is reminded of Lewis Carroll ’ s Alice in Wonderland , in which Alice exclaims , “ Curiouser and curiouser ! ”\nWhile the mainstream media continues to provide breathless coverage as events unfold , they evidence a strong disinclination to ferret out more information regarding the whistleblower ’ s actual identity or motives in coming forward — almost relishing the idea that HIC hearings can feature his testimony ( whether he is actually present or not ) without his identity ever becoming known .\nThe obvious parallel is to “ Deep Throat , ” Woodward and Bernstein ’ s alleged secret source for many of their Watergate revelations , whose identity remained not only secret but also an integral part of Georgetown cocktail conversation for the next 30 years .\nFor those not living through the halcyon days of Watergate , Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein became famous for their series of revelations regarding the status of prosecutors ’ ongoing Watergate investigations , but it was not until their 1974 book , All the President ’ s Men , that they credited a secret source they claimed to have referred to as “ Deep Throat , ” after a popular pornographic movie character . The more recent backstory is that their publisher at Simon & Schuster had encouraged them to add more drama to their proposed book , which is how the term first came into being . In short , Deep Throat was not a term used in print or even newsroom discussions before it first appeared in their book — as their calculatedly mysterious source .\nRegardless , speculation about just who Deep Throat might be was a dominant feature of Washington gossip for the ensuing decades . Possible candidates were inevitably confined to those who had served on President Nixon ’ s White House staff , including his Chief of Staff Alexander Haig , one of his many lawyers ( John Dean , Fred Fielding , Len Garment , or Fred Buzhardt ) , one of his speechwriters ( Bill Safire , David Gergen , or Ben Stein ) , or one of other young White House aides ( including Diane Sawyer , Jonathan Rose , or Jeff Donfeld ) . Even Henry Kissinger ’ s name occasionally surfaced in the unending speculation .\nThe common theme was that Deep Throat had become so disgusted with Nixon ’ s conduct that the need to reveal the wrongdoing far outweighed any idea of loyalty to the president . This was in spite of the fact that my boss and Nixon ’ s lead Watergate defense counsel thought at the time that the leaks were coming from Mark Felt at the FBI . This belief was accompanied by the recognition that we weren ’ t in a position to do much about it , since pressuring Felt might result in even more leaks . In fact , there is a humorous conversation on the White House tapes in which Haig suggests to Nixon that Felt is the one doing the leaking — and characterizes him as “ the white rat. ” Haig goes on to explain that ’ s what Felt is called behind his back at the Bureau : He has a long face and a rather sallow complexion . “ Well , Mr. President , he looks like a rat , ” is how Haig finally sums it up .\nFor decades afterwards , when I would mention that I had worked on Nixon ’ s White House staff , people would inevitably ask if I knew who Deep Throat was . When I answered in the affirmative , they would get all excited — until I said it was Mark Felt , the white rat . Then , since this obviously was not some famous name from Nixon ’ s own White House , their interest would wane and the conversation would move on .\nWhen Felt ’ s daughter claimed he was Deep Throat in 2005 and Woodward and Bernstein rushed out a book , The Secret Man : The Story of Watergate ’ s Deep Throat , supposedly confirming it , everyone accepted it at face value . For his part , Felt was way too senile to provide any real confirmation . More significantly , it turned out that Felt had no animosity toward President Nixon ; his leaks were designed to show that Acting FBI Director Patrick Gray couldn ’ t control the FBI and should be replaced by then–Deputy Director Felt .\nWhy , then , had all of the media been so certain for the prior three decades that Deep Throat simply had to be a disillusioned Nixon White House staffer ? Following Felt ’ s 2005 outing , I went back and re-read All the President ’ s Men and then compared the book to the subsequent movie version — only to discover tantalizing differences in Deep Throat ’ s treatment .\nIn their book , there is no implication whatsoever that Deep Throat is a White House employee . The authors were very careful not to give any hint at all as to his place of employment . The movie version , however , differs considerably — with implied White House employment occurring in three separate scenes : First , relatively early on , Woodward ( played by Robert Redford ) and Bernstein ( played by Dustin Hoffman ) are shown on the Library of Congress steps , lamenting that they are out of leads . Redford offers up the idea that he has a contact at the Nixon White House — and their paucity of leads quickly evaporates . Second , at one point , Redford calls Deep Throat ( played by Hal Holbrook ) at work . In the movie scene , Redford is shown in a public phone booth ( remember those ? ) located on the sidewalk across the street from the Old Executive Office Building — an integral part of the White House compound — which he stares at while speaking to Holbrook , who instructs him never again to call him at work . Third , when Holbrook departs from his office on his way to deliver secret papers in a nighttime rendezvous , he is shown as driving out of the White House ’ s Northwest Gate .\nThe result was the unspoken assurance of Deep Throat being a White House staffer . The movie audience , after all , saw this with their own eyes !\nSeveral other Deep Throat observations : By far the best description of Deep Throat and his activities is Max Holland ’ s Leak : Why Mark Felt Became Deep Throat ( 2012 ) , supplemented by Holland ’ s extensive critical review of the 2017 film Mark Felt . Separately , in a stressful FBI interview of Mark Felt , following his FBI retirement and shortly after publication of Woodward and Bernstein ’ s book , Felt is quoted by his FBI interrogators as having specifically denied that he was “ that fellow they call Deep Throat . ”\nIn spite of the Woodward and Bernstein books , I happened to believe their Deep Throat is a composite figure , rather than their exclusive source , a view apparently shared by their boss , Ben Bradlee . In an unpublished interview cited by Jeff Himmelman in Yours in Truth : A Personal Portrait of Ben Bradlee , Legendary Editor of The Washington Post ( 2012 ) , Bradlee expressed his own doubts as to the authenticity of the Deep Throat story :\nYou know I have a little problem with Deep Throat.… Did that potted [ plant ] incident ever happen ? … and meeting in some garage . One meeting in the garage ? Fifty meetings in the garage ? I don ’ t know how many meetings in the garage.… There ’ s a residual fear in my soul that that isn ’ t quite straight .\nIt also is interesting to note that lead Watergate prosecutor Earl Silbert has stated that nothing in the Woodward and Bernstein articles was helpful to his team of prosecutors since their stories were only reporting what the government already knew and had under investigation . Thus , while news to the general public , it was not revealing to those actually working on the case .\nOne wonders just how a reputation for relentlessly innovative and creative investigative reporting can be based on receiving a series of leaks from a disgruntled FBI official . Perhaps that ’ s why it was so important to keep Deep Throat ’ s identity secret long after the Watergate scandal had run its course .\nFinally , and most significantly , it is now clear that the American public was knowingly misled for three decades regarding Deep Throat ’ s identity and motive — all seemingly for the purpose of further undermining President Nixon and his White House staff .\nJust when , one might ask in light of all this , can we expect to learn the full truth about Trump ’ s whistleblower ?\nGeoff Shepard came to Washington , D.C. , as a White House Fellow right after graduation from Harvard Law School and spent five years on Nixon ’ s White House staff , including being deputy counsel on his Watergate defense team .

    "441": "Gay rights wo n't fade as a political issue . The Republican base won ’ t let it .\nProminent Republicans calculated that if the Supreme Court ruled that same-sex marriage was constitutionally protected , the issue would become settled law and disappear politically . This would be welcome , they reasoned , as the party was on the wrong side of the politics and history .\nThen Indiana enacted a Religious Freedom Restoration Act last month that critics said would allow private enterprises to discriminate against gays and lesbians . Arkansas followed with a similar measure .\nAfter vehement opposition from businesses in both states , Republican governors forced modifications that make it more difficult to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation .\nBut a leading indicator was the reaction of Republican presidential candidates : They leapt to defend the initial Indiana law . Jeb Bush expressed all-out support in an interview on a conservative radio talk show and then modified his position at a Silicon Valley fundraiser .\nSocial conservatives are determined to keep this issue alive , reasoning that the environment that produced changes in the laws last week will become more favorable after they have had time to stir up the grassroots . That will pose problems for Republicans in a general election ; the politics have changed dramatically compared with a decade ago , when Republican political guru Karl Rove used the issue against Democrats .\nCrucial elements of the Republican base have n't changed . Most , not all , evangelical/born-again white Christians are troubled by gay rights . This group accounts for more than 40 percent of the Republicans nationally and for more than 50 percent of the vote in the important early Iowa and South Carolina Republican presidential tests . That guarantees Ted Cruz and Mike Huckabee will make these issues uncomfortable for Jeb Bush and Scott Walker .\nNineteen states have religious freedom laws , and some go beyond the 1993 federal law . Four -- Connecticut , Illinois , New Mexico and Rhode Island -- have measures that include a ban on discrimination based on sexual orientation .\nBut Indiana postponed the matter of prohibiting anti-gay discrimination . In Georgia recently , as the legislature drafted a measure supported by religious conservatives , a Republican tried to amend it to clarify that it wouldn ’ t permit discrimination against gays and lesbians ; the bill ’ s sponsor suggested that would defeat the law 's purpose .\nThe politically powerful religious or conservative right can be expected to set litmus tests for Republican presidential candidates : opposing new anti-discrimination measures designed to protect gays and lesbians and guarding against what they warn is a slippery slope on matters including adoptions by same-sex couples .\nMany of these social activists sincerely worry that it 's white people of religion who face discrimination ; some believe that same-sex marriage , gay rights in general , violate the law of God .\nThere are parallels to race . Religion was often cited as a rationale for segregation ; if God intended whites and blacks to be together , why did he create different races , fundamentalists would ask . There were similar issues with discrimination in public accommodations and housing . It wasn ’ t until 1967 that the Supreme Court gave constitutional protection to interracial marriage .\nToday , these issues create a genuine schism among Republican constituencies , with much of the business community showing support for gay rights . These are n't just West Coast or high-tech firms , but companies based in Middle America , such as Eli Lilly and Wal-Mart .\nThe religious right sees this as a battle between economics and morality . Politically , however , the most telling reaction to the Indiana law was that of well-known athletes usually not considered part of any left-wing crusade . The basketball great Charles Barkley suggested the collegiate basketball tournament should n't be held in Indiana , and Pat Haden , former all-star quarterback and now athletic director at the University of Southern California , boycotted an athletic event in the Hoosier state . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "442": "On May 4 , with a more recent update , the Committee to Unleash Prosperity and FreedomWorks released a report card on the COVID-19 response by the Nation ’ s governors . Nine governors , eight of whom were Republicans from the South or Midwest , got A marks . Fifteen , including Gov . Larry Hogan ( R ) of Maryland and Jim Justice of West Virginia ( R ) , got D ’ s , and five Democrats got F ’ s . In the update , one governor was downgraded to an F- .\nThe report considers “ the severity of the virus in each state and the need to keep their citizens safe ” and relates it to “ how measured or damaging their actions have been with respect to safeguarding the economic well-being of their citizens. ” It ’ s premised on the belief that except for “ a few exceptions in some metropolitan areas , the time is long past for every state to reopen safely , smartly , and judiciously so as to end the economic destruction and despair from lockdowns . ”\nAs for the grading , the report explains that A ’ s and B ’ s are for governors who “ are already moving to restore freedom and opportunity , and trusting individuals to follow best practices or isolate themselves based on their own risk assessments. ” The governors who got D ’ s and F ’ s have taken the other tack ; they “ arbitrarily ban activities without respect to any sensible risk versus benefit calculation ” and put their states at “ risk of catastrophic economic collapse . ”\nThe day after the report was first released , there were reports that some governors acted . It may be just sequential correlation , not causation , but those actions should be welcomed . And , as noted below , the courts have also reined in governors guilty of overreaching .\nCalifornia Gov . Gavin Newsom ( D ) , who got a D , said that retail stores could reopen for curbside pickup and allowed nonessential manufacturing to start . Virginia Gov . Ralph Northam ( D ) , who started with an F , shortened the term of his lockdown from June 10 to May 15 . Arizona Gov . Doug Ducey ( R ) , who started with a C , also accelerated the reopening of restaurants and salons .\nOther governors have responded with less grace . Pennsylvania Gov . Tom Wolf ( D ) , who was unsurprisingly given an F in the report card , criticized business owners moving to reopen notwithstanding his edicts , accusing them of “ cowardly acts. ” He also threatened those businesses that reopen with the loss of health department certifications , liquor licenses , and certificates of occupancy . Finally , Gov . Wolf declared that counties that refused to comply with his orders would not be eligible to receive discretionary federal stimulus funds .\nIn the same way , Michigan Gov . Gretchen Whitmer , who received a D , started by declaring home improvement and landscaping purchases off limits while allowing Michigan residents to buy lottery tickets . She later declared that her diktats were “ not a suggestion ” and compliance with them was “ not optional. ” That ’ s , again , in a state where the problem is concentrated in Detroit and not in the northern parts of the state .\nNew Jersey Gov . Phil Murphy ( D ) , who got an F , was recently downgraded to an F- . The report explains that the downgrade is attributable to , among other things , “ his new comments about leaving the state if you don ’ t like the incompetence of its unemployment office . ”\nIllinois Gov . J . B. Pritzker was also downgraded from a D to an F after announcing that “ the entire state will stay on full lockdown until May 29 — or later . ”\nGov . Murphy also said that the Constitution was above his pay grade . That misguided notion explains why the Second Amendment gets no respect from some . It also explains why some governors like Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear ( D ) , a C grade , thought it was a good idea to prohibit “ faith-based ” “ mass gatherings ” until May 20 , and for state troopers to take the license plate numbers of those attending a drive-in Easter service at Maryville Baptist Church in Kentucky .\nFederal judges put a stop to that . The Sixth Circuit held that the governor ’ s rule had so many exceptions that it could not be seen as one of general applicability . In that light , the Court observed , “ The Governor has offered no good reason for refusing to trust the congregants who promise to use care in worship in just the same way it trusts accountants , lawyers , and laundromat workers to do the same . ”\nWisconsin Gov . Tony Evers ( D ) also got an F. Wisconsin ’ s Supreme Court concluded that the Evers administration ’ s Department of Human Services Secretary-designee Andrea Palm , “ an unelected official , ” exceeded the scope of her authority under state law when she commanded the residents of Wisconsin to “ ‘ stay at home or at their place of residence ’ with certain limited exceptions approved by Palm or risk punishment ‘ by up to 30 days imprisonment or up to a $ 250 fine , or both. ’ ” It held that Palm ’ s directive , which is a “ general order of general applicability , ” had to comply with the state ’ s process for rule-making . Significantly , the court rejected Palm ’ s contention that her order was temporary , observing “ a ‘ limited-in-time scenario ’ is not the power that Palm has seized . ”\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court pointed out the importance of following the regulatory process . It noted , “ [ I ] t does not follow [ that Palm ] can impose regulation without giving the people faith in the justness of the regulation. ” Arbitrary and overbearing assertions of governmental authority have been met with political protests in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania grounded in a lack of faith that the state ’ s impositions are justified .

Maybe they 're sucking up to Donald Trump and his friend Carlos Slim , Mexico 's richest crony capitalist , and the Times ' biggest shareholder .\nA front-page story smears David and Charles Koch ( the former of whom is a trustee of ███ Foundation , the nonprofit that publishes this website )\nFirst , the reporter labels them `` the ultraconservative billionaire brothers . '' Ultra ? Why ultra ? Why conservative even ?\nThe Kochs favor liberal immigration rules , gay marriage , legal drugs , ending racial discrimination in criminal sentencing , fighting in fewer foreign wars and getting rid of government bailouts and favors for businesses , including their own . David Koch supports higher taxes to reduce the deficit . Which of those things is conservative ? !\nMaybe the Times calls the Kochs `` ultraconservative '' because a political group they support points out , `` Policies that subsidize electric vehicles and solar panels for the wealthy raise energy prices '' and gas and oil are cheaper for everyone . The reporter adds that the group even showed a `` video of people driving , turning on lights and plugging in appliances . '' Oh , no ! How terrible !\nThe reporter claims the `` Kochs have long worked to quash… renewable energy sources like wind and solar . '' But they have n't ! They try to quash subsidies for renewables . Big difference . Does n't the Times know the difference ?\nThe Times appeals to its Trump-hating readers with a headline that begins `` Sensing Gains Ahead Under Trump , the Kochs … '' But the Kochs did n't give Trump a penny .\nIt 's time for the Times to stop calling all their opponents `` conservatives . '' Some of us are libertarians . America has other choices besides the anti-capitalism of the Times and anti-capitalism of Trump .\nThe Times quotes left-wing New York Governor Andrew Cuomo ( D ) saying it `` defies common sense '' to have a nuclear power plant near New York City . Green activists oppose the plant and Cuomo now says it will close .\nBut where will New Yorkers get power ? The `` options include hydropower from Quebec and power from wind farms . ''\nGreat . But what will we do when the wind does n't blow ? At least the reporter admits that `` New York City could be burdened with higher energy prices . '' Could be ? Will be !\nThat 's the headline on a Nicholas Kristof column about drought in southern Africa . Apparently , there were no dry spells before `` man-made global warming . ''\nIn truth , starvation has decreased dramatically thanks to fossil fuels . Starvation now is caused by corrupt governments , not climate change .\nIf there 's a way to blame capitalism even as it improves the world , the Times will find it . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "444": "Rep. Mark Amodei ( R-NV ) , Nevada ’ s only Republican U.S. House member , confirmed to ███ on Saturday afternoon in an exclusive phone interview that media and leftist claims that he supports an “ impeachment inquiry ” are inaccurate : he does not support an “ impeachment inquiry ” into President Donald Trump .\n“ Right , ” Amodei told ███ when asked to confirm he does not support an impeachment inquiry that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats are now conducting into President Trump .\n“ You ’ re sitting there going wow , look at this guy ’ s history , ” Amodei said in an exclusive interview on Saturday . “ I ’ m not a household name or anything like that , so you think I just lost my mind one day and ate some loco weed and called all the Nevada people in and said , ‘ Here we go ’ ? I guess the reason I ’ m not phenomenally agitated or whatever is is quite frankly I think that Humberto Sanchez ’ s article was fair and accurate . There ’ s confusion throughout the nation between what we did with the UC to send it to the appropriate committees , which the White House supports , and what Pelosi is doing . So it would certainly be news if that ’ s what I was saying I was in favor of . We got into some discussions about ‘ what ifs ’ and it ’ s like hey , let the committees do their work and see where it leads . Wherever it leads , it leads—let the chips fall where they may . But how you get from that discussion in context to ‘ Oh my god he supports Pelosi ’ s thing ’ is not true . ”\nWhat he does support is what every other member of the House of Representatives and the Senate—in addition to the White House—supports , which is a resolution that passed both the House and Senate unanimously with White House backing earlier this week calling for the so-called “ whistleblower complaint ” and other information to be transmitted to the relevant congressional committees . In the House , that was H. Res 576 . It passed the House 421-0 . Amodei told ███ that he has been misquoted by many in the national media who say that means he supports an “ impeachment inquiry , ” but that he does not support one .\n“ No , ” Amodei again told ███ when asked if he supports what Pelosi and Democrats are doing in what they call an “ impeachment inquiry ” through the various House committees including the Intelligence , Judiciary , Foreign Affairs , Financial Services , and other committees .\nSeveral national media outlets have raced Amodei ’ s comments out into the public sphere to use them to create the appearance of dissent in GOP ranks when it comes to Pelosi ’ s “ impeachment inquiry ” of the president . Among them are the New York Times , MSNBC , CBS News , and several others who claim Amodei became the first Republican to support an “ impeachment inquiry ” of Trump . But Amodei , in a lengthy interview with ███ on Saturday afternoon , confirmed that no he does not support an “ impeachment inquiry ” of Trump and in fact does not have a position that is different from the White House or other Republicans in Congress at this point .\nThe way this all started was Amodei , in the interest of transparency with his local in-state media , held a press call on Friday to explain where he was on all of the news this week in Washington .\n“ We did this news conference at the end of the week via telephone because quite frankly I hadn ’ t said much about it , ” Amodei told ███ . “ Some of the Nevada outlets were like hey , so we said here ’ s the conference call-in let ’ s do a call . We did a conference call . Tt lasted about 40 minutes ; I ’ m sure there are tapes of it from people who participated . So it ’ s like hey , you can listen to the tapes to form your own opinion . But I don ’ t think it was a close call throughout the 40 minutes , it was that I support the resolution that came through UC [ unanimous consent ] in the Senate , I support the resolution that we did in the House earlier in the week that basically got rid of all the Pelosi poison-pill stuff and they changed it to mirror the Senate wording exactly . The White House supports it . I support it too . I ’ m a process guy , let ’ s send it to the committees and see what it ’ s all about . So you ’ re like what the heck are you talking about for ‘ it ’ ? ‘ It ’ is all this recent stuff for transcripts and quid pro quo and Ukraine and all that other sort of stuff—that ’ s it . I support this thing that has 535 other votes and the White House ’ s support . ”\nThe Nevada Independent published an article about it all . It explained the congressman ’ s position on it , and he has no issue with that article . What he does have an issue with is other people using it to claim he supports an “ impeachment inquiry ” like what Pelosi is doing when he does not support any such thing—and has no different position from the rest of the Republicans in the House .\nAn “ impeachment inquiry ” is what Pelosi has announced the Democrats are doing—something most Democrats have announced they agree with—not the bipartisan , unanimously-backed oversight investigations that are perfunctory and normal in Washington as part of the unanimous resolutions .\nAlso , Amodei , on both Wednesday and Friday before Congress broke for the two-week recess it is currently on , voted with all the Republicans in the House in favor of a resolution from House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to express disapproval with the way in which Pelosi had launched Democrats ’ impeachment proceedings against Trump . All the Democrats voted against it .\nNonetheless , the New York Times added him to a column in a list it is keeping , saying he is the first Republican to support an “ impeachment inquiry. ” Several others in national media have pushed the same inaccuracy , which all forced Amodei to issue a statement on Friday night further clarifying he is not in favor of impeachment of Trump and explaining the investigations . But many in media have still not corrected their inaccurate claims he supports an “ impeachment inquiry , ” to the point where Amodei has even directed his staff to contact the New York Times and pull him out of the list of members supporting an “ impeachment inquiry . ”\nThe first Republican House member has announced support for the impeachment inquiry against President Trump : Representative Mark Amodei of Nevada See the full list : https : //t.co/nnYylNUBSA pic.twitter.com/7SUfyj48Sq — The New York Times ( @ nytimes ) September 27 , 2019\n“ We asked them to take it down out of the column , ” Amodei told ███ . “ We gave them a real simple ask this morning . They got columns on who ’ s in , who ’ s out , et cetera . I had my comms person who you ’ ve been talking to send them an email and say , ‘ Hey this is not accurate , please take him out of that column. ’ I ’ m shocked she ’ s gotten crickets so far , which I expect she will continue to get . But when you say how I do I feel about the New York Times thing , quite frankly , after the Kavanaugh stuff and some of the other stuff recently it ’ s like—if it were like the old days , and I ’ m 61 so you can attach to that whatever meaning you want , the New York Times came out and said you were whatever that was usually pretty strong . But in these times , the fact that the New York Times says quite frankly means ‘ better check further . ’ ”\nThe Times has not backed down , and continues to—even though it is aware the inclusion of Amodei in this column is inaccurate—keep him included in it . Multiple inquiries from ███ to New York Times spokeswomen Eileen Murphy and Danielle Rhoades-Ha have not been returned , but both—as well as newspaper editorial staff—are aware Amodei does not support an “ impeachment inquiry , ” and still the newspaper will not correct the error .\nAmodei ’ s staff has asked the Times multiple times to correct the inaccuracy , but its staff refuses to do so , even though the Times knows it is not correct .\nFor Amodei , he ’ s not even that upset or surprised given the hyper-charged political atmosphere and the media ’ s transparent hatred of Trump . He just wishes the national media would have done a little more research before getting this story so badly wrong by falsely saying he supports an impeachment inquiry into Trump . He noted that when the Access Hollywood tapes came out in the 2016 election , he actually publicly defended Trump—and has been a longtime supporter of the president and the White House .\n“ I ’ m okay with the people who are highly charged and hyper emotional and all that stuff—it ’ s been that way for a long time , ” Amodei said . “ The sad part about all this is when that is the sole thing that ’ s focused on instead of the facts , which by the way are not buried here . It would be news , because here is a guy who has really been a pretty loyal soldier and has supported the White House back to before they were the White House , when the Billy Bush tapes came out . I came out and basically said , ‘ hey , ’ I wrote a letter then that everybody published . So it would absolutely be news if that guy said , ‘ you know what ? I want to be with Democrats in the House on this thing. ’ You see how naive I am , I figured everyone would ask a couple questions . Nothing . Basically nothing . Just off to the races and they think I have lost my mind—or I guess depending on your view , found my mind . ”\nWhile the New York Times and several others got it wrong , not everyone did . The congressman said that he read the original ███ account of it , and thanked this outlet for getting it correct . ███ did not , like much of the rest of the media , jump out and publish the inaccurate claims that Amodei had joined calls for an “ impeachment inquiry ” but instead reached out to his office to check and got confirmation that he did not . Then ███ accurately reported that the rest of the media had printed fake news , and Amodei was not supporting impeachment or an impeachment inquiry .\n“ When it ’ s like actually , if you really care about the news conference that he basically set up to be open with my media in my state , it ’ s like wow . And listen , I think they did a decent job . I don ’ t think anybody in my state hatcheted me . It ’ s incredible that folks who don ’ t even know who I am didn ’ t even bother to check out a few things . But you guys did—you guys ran an article that said , ‘ This is fake news. ’ I don ’ t know what you call it , but it isn ’ t what I said in the thing . Everyone else who wrote about it , they didn ’ t write it in their articles . Were they asleep on the call just snoring ? ”\nOnly one other reporter , Politico ’ s Kyle Cheney , did not falsely jump to the conclusion that Amodei was supporting an impeachment inquiry . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "445": "In the original Planet of the Apes movie ( 1968 ) , the most-fascinating character is Dr. Zaius , the elitist , orangutan in chief who alone possessed the secret knowledge that ( spoiler alert ! ) apes descended from humans . Toward the end of the film—shortly before he warns Charlton Heston 's character not to search for the truth `` because you may not like what you find ! `` —he monologues that the hoi polloi ( chimps and gorillas in this case ) must be shielded from certain realities lest they be driven to insanity and nihilism .\nThe legacy media are having their Dr. Zaius moment , paternalistically shielding their infantile audience ( read : you and me ) from ugly images and realities . This is not simply a revolting development but a deeply troubling one that will only accelerate the ongoing loss of confidence and trust the public has in media . According to polling done for the Columbia Journalism Review , fewer than 20 percent of us have a `` great deal of confidence '' in the press . The only institution held in lower esteem is Congress .\nYet the media seem happy to keep digging their own grave . Yesterday , for instance , The New York Times reported on what it called a `` macabre video of [ a ] fake Trump shooting media and critics '' that was shown at a conference held at one of the president 's own properties ( Trump had nothing to do with the conference or the video , which the White House has condemned ) . You 'd assume the paper would link to or embed the video in support of its characterization . But it refused to , even as it 's safe to say that it was the Times ' coverage that helped bring the video to a large viewing audience ( that 's how I learned about it ) . Instead , it described the video , which was included in an exhibition of videos associated with pro-Trump `` memesmith '' Carpe Donktum , thus :\nThe video , which includes the logo for Mr. Trump 's 2020 re-election campaign , comprises a series of internet memes . The most violent clip shows Mr. Trump 's head superimposed on the body of a man opening fire inside the `` Church of Fake News '' on parishioners who have the faces of his critics or the logos of media organizations superimposed on their bodies . It appears to be an edited scene of a church massacre from the 2014 dark comedy film `` Kingsman : The Secret Service . ''\nHere 's the video that the Times was quick to write about but refused to link to in its online coverage ( forget about embedding ! ) . Decide for yourself is this is too much for regular folks to handle :\nThe video , which was originally posted to YouTube over a year ago , had virtually no views until the Times ' coverage ; as of this writing , it had more than 136,000 views on the channel above and has been viewed millions more times in various YouTube and Twitter iterations . The Times ' leadership seems more than willing to grab readers ' eyeballs by talking about the video , but they are not willing to provide readers with easy access to the offending material .\nA similar mindset seems at work behind the producers of Meet the Press , who `` in good conscience '' refused to show footage from a recent presidential rally that they nonetheless had no qualms about condemning from a moral point of view :\nHere 's one version of relevant passages from the rally , in which the president lays into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter ( this starts around the two-minute mark ) . Trump 's rhetorical question , `` Where 's Hunter ? '' even started trending on Twitter in the wake of this .\nIt 's ugly stuff , to be sure , but that 's exactly why the press should not be reticent both in covering controversial speech and providing access to it . That 's the best way for the audience to agree with any given outlet 's analysis , assuming it is accurate and truly persuasive . Instead , the press is choosing to become passive-aggressive , effectively saying , `` Here 's a really disturbing important thing that X just did , but we 're not going to let you judge for yourself . '' That 's what the New Zealand media did after the Christchurch mass shooting this year . In the name of fighting `` extremism , '' the government banned owning or sharing the shooter 's manifesto , which was a disgusting piece of incoherent white supremacist garbage . Amazingly , the New Zealand media voluntarily censored its own coverage of the event , the shooter , and judicial procedures—and drew praise from American journalists for such actions .\nThe actions of the Times , Meet the Press , and the New Zealand media will not slow the loss of confidence and trust in the media . On the contrary , such behavior will accelerate it as readers continue to rebel against such paternalism by searching out alternative sources of information ( including many shady , conspiracist sites ) . There 's already a widespread belief , some or much it justified , that powerful elites hold most Americans in various forms of contempt . Simultaneously telling those same readers , viewers , and listeners that big , important , scary things are happening and then withholding primary sources is a perfect recipe to increase cynicism and anger toward the media .\nPaternalism did n't work for Dr. Zaius ( what kind of doctor was he , anyway ? ) and it 's even less likely to work for the solons overseeing the decline of empires of print , cable , and other forms of legacy media . They should trust their readership and give them more information , not less , when it comes to the news of the day . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "446": "When I moved to Orange County in the mid-1990s , it was still the most Republican county , in raw numbers , in the United States . Virtually anyone with serious political ambition there ran as a Republican , although changes were starting to appear . Democrat Loretta Sanchez eked out a victory over GOP firebrand “ B-1 Bob ” Dornan in the 1996 congressional election — something Dornan blamed on invalid votes , but others knew was a sign of things to come .\nI met Rep. Dornan at a conservative organizing event in Des Moines as he tried to drum up support for his presidential bid . The GOP congressman spent time in Iowa when he could have been campaigning in and around Garden Grove . Sanchez ’ s victory was a shock at the time , but the county GOP remained strong outside the highly urbanized , ethnically diverse areas of the central county . It was business as usual .\nI used to laugh about the GOP ’ s big election night parties , usually at a posh hotel near John Wayne Airport . Not only would one find virtually every Republican elected official at the festivities , but you ’ d often find Democratic officials there , too . If you wanted to be near the center of power , you had to attend an event sponsored by the party . The biggest tussles were between conservatives and the RINOs ( Republican in Name Only ) . Democrats were an afterthought .\nOrange County wasn ’ t just Republican , but it was the Republican Mecca . Ronald Reagan was propelled into politics by OC activists and donors . Richard Nixon , originally from Yorba Linda , had his Western White House in San Clemente . But as the county ’ s defense-based economy and demographics changed , so did its politics . I recall when Republicans dismissed the chances of an upstart Democratic Assembly candidate , Lou Correa , who not only won the 1998 election but now is a member of Congress .\nRepublicans struggled for years to overthrow a prominent liberal Democratic mayor in Irvine , and they finally accomplished that task a few years ago . But it ’ s just a footnote now . The county government released its latest voter-registration figures , and Reagan Country is a memory . Democrats have grabbed a slight registration advantage over Republicans . The small lead is mostly about bragging rights , but it ’ s the final psychological blow to a county party that ’ s long been collapsing .\nOrange County Republicans had been operating as if nothing had changed , but in 2016 Hillary Clinton received more votes than Donald Trump . The biggest setback came in the midterms . Democrats took every OC congressional race and made serious gains in state legislative seats , too . These days , the county GOP would be more than happy to have lawmakers who were Republican at all , whether in name only or not .\nThis has enormous ramifications for the state as a whole . California Republicans counted on Orange County ’ s overwhelmingly GOP vote totals to overcome its disadvantage elsewhere in statewide races . Now that its most Republican large county is pretty evenly split , where will Republican votes come from to help balance Democratic strongholds elsewhere ? Placer County , in the foothills east of Sacramento , remains strongly Republican , but it has fewer than 400,000 residents . No wonder Republicans are no longer competitive in any statewide races .\nWe just need to look statewide to see what ’ s happening . Without political competition , issues such as statewide rent control , single-payer health care , wacky environmental and nanny state issues , and an endless push for tax increases will always remain front and center .\nThe recriminations are pointless . Some Republicans blame the president for pushing wealthy and diverse suburban counties into the blue column , while others blame immigration for the ultimate changes in voting patterns . Republican-minded voters have been fleeing the state for years , which hasn ’ t helped , either . Others blame the party ’ s leadership . Whatever the case , the GOP needs to face up to reality and come up with new strategies to stay relevant , or the death spiral will continue .\nIn Orange County , 27 percent of voters are No Party Preference . Statewide , No Party Preference registrants have surpassed GOP voters . “ The number of registered Democrats has fallen by about 110,000 since the 2016 election , ” the Sacramento Bee reported . “ The number of Republicans has dropped by about 340,000 . ”\nThere ’ s opportunity in those numbers . It ’ s not as if California voters are in love with the Democrats , either . There are plenty of issues that Republicans can tap — road congestion , a housing crisis , service cutbacks , crime hikes , poverty rates , growing pension liabilities — but the party ’ s poor leadership and outdated thinking have gotten it nowhere .\nAt the state level , Republicans always get obliterated now . The two non-liberals who came closest to winning in the last election cycle both lacked the GOP label . Former Republican Steve Poizner ran for insurance commissioner as No Party Preference and lost by nearly 6 percentage points to Democrat Ricardo Lara . Pro-charter-school candidate Marshall Tuck came within 2 percentage points of teachers ’ union ally Tony Thurmond in the nonpartisan race for superintendent of public instruction . Compare that to the governor ’ s race , in which Democrat Gavin Newsom beat Republican John Cox by 24 percentage points .\nThere ’ s probably no realistic hope for Republicans or any sense of political competition , and we just have to live with the political consequences . These trends have been in the works for two decades , but OC ’ s final flip from red to blue adds a punctuation point to California Republican decline . Perhaps the GOP can be heartened by an old Reagan quotation : “ The future doesn ’ t belong to the fainthearted ; it belongs to the brave . ” \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

But on Tuesday , she made it official , saying she plans to stay at her post until the end of the year .\n`` I think you have to be selfless enough to know when you need to step aside and allow someone else to do the job , '' she told reporters in the Oval Office Tuesday . `` So thank you , Mr. President . It has been an honor of a lifetime . ''\nSenators confirmed the former South Carolina governor as US ambassador to the UN on the fourth day of Trump 's presidency by a vote of 96 to 4 .

    "448": "Tucker Carlson is rapidly becoming America ’ s most important television journalist , because Carlson is willing , where no others are , to call out the abject lies emanating from the mainstream Beltway spin machine .\nAnd earlier this week Carlson did the public two important services .\nFirst , he provided a measure of accountability , where virtually no one else would , in savaging “ vulture capitalist ” and GOP mega-donor Paul Singer for what the latter did to the town of Sidney , Nebraska , in 2015 . Singer bought stock in the hunting-and-fishing-gear retailer Cabela ’ s , and from his fresh seat on the company ’ s board he cajoled its management into agreeing on the company ’ s sale to Bass Pro Shops . That sale hit Sidney , the home of Cabela ’ s corporate headquarters , especially hard . Some 2,000 jobs went away in a town of less than 10,000 people , and the economic effects of Singer ’ s actions there were akin to a nuclear bomb dropping on the town .\nCarlson spotlighted that episode in hedge-fund shame and noted that Singer has avoided any accountability for what he ’ s done due to massive contributions to the GOP . The story is of a piece with a not-infrequent pattern wherein major donors to the party have pushed it into policy positions that give heft to Democrat accusations that Republicans don ’ t care about ordinary folks . Ace of Spades offers a must-read treatment of this story in a post written just after Carlson shined a spotlight on the Singer–Sidney mess , including asking the question why Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse , who seems to pride himself on being a thoughtful , caring Republican , didn ’ t seem to have a problem with the Cabela ’ s sellout ( coinciding , of course , with a max-out donation by Singer to his campaign ) .\nBut after he was finished with that essential piece of business , Carlson landed an outstanding interview with a reporter for the Nation , a not-particularly-conservative publication . But Aaron Maté had a lot to say that strayed from the last week ’ s D.C. media narrative on Ukraine , which more or less consumed U.S. Sen. John Kennedy ( R-LA ) , who committed the grievous error of basing his public statements on what he thought were established facts .\nSpecifically , Kennedy had commented that there was evidence the 2016 U.S. presidential election didn ’ t just bear the mark of Russian meddling but that individuals in Ukraine had also left their fingerprints on the process .\nThis wasn ’ t controversial all that long ago , you know . CBS News , back in 2017 :\nIt wasn ’ t so much the Clinton campaign , per se , but a Democratic operative working with the Democratic National Committee did reach out to the Ukrainian government in an attempt to get damaging information about the Trump campaign . That operative ’ s name is Alexandra Chalupa , a Ukrainian-American former Clinton White House aide who was tasked with ethnic outreach on behalf of the Democratic Party . As Vogel reported , she knew about Paul Manafort ’ s extensive connections to the pro-Russian regime of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych , and decided to dig deeper into possible connections between Moscow and the Trump campaign . As part of that effort , she discussed Manafort with the high-ranking officials at the Ukrainian embassy in Washington , D.C . The Democratic National Committee denies that it was ever in contact with the Ukrainian government .\nYanukovych was the guy Paul Manafort was working for before President Trump brought him on as his campaign manager , which probably wasn ’ t the best decision he ever made . But the Democrats absolutely reached out to Chalupa in an effort to politically monetize that relationship with Yanukovych ’ s successor Petro Poroshenko against Trump , and when Yanukovych was tossed out of power in 2014 , the regime that followed was , through Chalupa , without question dancing with Hillary Clinton ’ s campaign . Hot Air ’ s Ed Morrissey , writing at the Week back in 2017 , did a good job of chronicling what the Clinton camp was up to with Ukraine , among other things :\nEven more to the point , no experienced campaign would allow senior members to meet with a source without ensuring it would be productive first . As an example , recall that the Democrats worked with a foreign government to dig for dirt on Trump , too . Politico ‘ s Kenneth Vogel and David Stern reported in early January that the DNC contacted officials from the Ukrainian government for their own oppo research efforts . These contacts did not involve cut-outs , as Veselnitskaya may or may not have been , but did directly assist in searching for damaging information that could be used in the election . But where Trump ’ s own flesh and blood was involved in clandestine meetings , the DNC was careful to keep Clinton and her family at arm ’ s length , handling the connections to Ukrainian officials through operative Alexandra Chalupa . Chalupa , whose work included engaging with expatriate Democratic voters , suspected Manafort was using his Russian connections to boost Trump . According to Politico , she began coordinating with officials at Ukraine ’ s Washington embassy to expedite her research , in the hopes of provoking Congress into holding a hearing before the election about Russian contact with the Trump campaign .\nWe could provide a lot more in the way of references proving that Clinton and the Democrats were using Ukrainian sources to get dirt on Trump . And no , it ’ s hardly beyond the pale to describe the Ukrainian cooperation in those efforts as “ meddling . ”\nEspecially when it has never been proven that the Russians provided WikiLeaks with the Democratic National Committee ’ s emails , which is the central allegation behind the Trump–Russia narrative the Democrats inflicted on the country for two-plus years before it collapsed earlier this year . The only “ evidence ” that has ever been proffered toward that narrative was a judgment by intelligence agencies we now know were compromised by anti-Trump actors both at the top and in middle management , but without any public showing of evidence of Russian hacking . WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has never wavered from his insistence that the DNC emails were not given to him by the Russians , and it ’ s never been proven those emails were hacked rather than leaked .\nThat last bit is important because it ’ s a bit of accepted wisdom in Washington that has informed a narrative that somehow Trump ’ s election was illegitimate and the product of foreign influence — without which there would be zero basis for the Democrats ’ current impeachment narrative . Fundamentally , this comes down to a familiar refrain : it isn ’ t news when foreign actors help Democrats get elected in American presidential elections ; it ’ s only interesting when there are indications foreigners might not help the Dems . Consider the case of George Nader , for example , which virtually none of the mainstream media organs bothered to cover .\nBut when Kennedy brought up what was commonly understood back in 2017 , that the Ukrainians were helping the Democrats to expose Manafort as a supposedly Russia-friendly tool for Putin to control Trump , and when he cast it as meddling in the election , something any reasonable person would have to credit as at least a valid take on the situation , he found himself trashed for his trouble .\nAs Carlson ’ s segment noted , such Establishment notables as Nicolle Wallace and Charlie Sykes , who we are supposed to believe are “ Republicans , ” began casting Kennedy as a Russian asset ( Wallace , whose intellectual candlepower is of a level making it certain she was merely saying what someone at MSNBC told her to say , might be excused for such inanity ; Sykes is less excusable ) . Worse , Sen. Mitt Romney rebuked Kennedy for suggesting Ukraine played a role in the 2016 election .\nOf course , there is almost nothing that Mitt Romney isn ’ t capable of turning septic for the Republican Party . He has proven that with perfect regularity since 2006 . The question is when the GOP and the people of Utah will finally flush this excrescent and odious malefactor out of our body politic once and for all .\nThe Washington media smelled the chum in the water left by the Never Trump crowd , and by Tuesday Kennedy had decided to cut bait on the Ukrainian-meddling narrative . He said he was finished talking about it , which didn ’ t stop some of the same media organs that had covered the story just 24 months before from hounding him about the “ conspiracy theories ” he was supposedly pushing .\nIf you ’ re reading this and concluding that the entire thing is stupid , congratulations — you ’ re paying attention . But until Carlson came along to bring someone from the Nation of all places to provide some sane analysis to the hysteria , the media narrative assaulting Kennedy was unchallenged .\nKudos to Kennedy for being willing to take the slings and arrows of the spinning liars inside the Beltway , at least for a while , and kudos to Carlson for setting the record straight . There isn ’ t enough actual honesty in any of this impeachment process , with its various clearly mendacious narratives , and when there are people of good faith willing to punch holes in the fetid web of slime woven by the Democrats and their media allies , those of us who care about the truth should stand with them . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "449": "Hundreds of the emails from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that were turned over to Congress regarding the Benghazi terrorist attack indicate that she and her advisers were closely monitoring the political fallout for the administration.According to The New York Times , sources say that Clinton 's top aides at times wrote to her about official business from their personal email accounts . Many of the messages were short or mundane , such as instructions to print an article or scheduling and logistics , but it 's unclear whether they represent all of the emails on the subject of Benghazi given that Clinton pre-selected which emails she turned over to the State Department.The emails did , however , show that Clinton and her inner circle reacted as the administration changed its position on what happened in the Benghazi attack after then-ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice appeared on several Sunday news programs instead of Clinton.Jake Sullivan , a foreign policy adviser , communicated with Clinton following Rice 's appearances , suggesting he was pleased with the way they went . `` She did make clear our view that this started spontaneously then evolved , '' Sullivan wrote to Clinton.But several weeks later , as Rice 's official explanation came under scrutiny , Sullivan emailed Clinton assuring her that she had avoided the public relations problems that Rice had found her in , the Times reported . `` You never said 'spontaneous ' or characterized their motivations , '' Sullivan wrote.The 300 emails sent to Congress represent a small fraction of the emails Clinton has turned over to the State Department , though the department has since requested all of her emails so as to respond to the committee requests.Nick Merrill , the spokesman for Clinton , defended the aides ' use of personal email saying that it was `` their practice to primarily use their work email when conducting state business , with only the tiniest fraction of the more than 1 million emails they sent or received involving their personal accounts , '' the Times reported.But some Republicans are not satisfied with that explanation and question the records provided by Clinton.South Carolina GOP Rep. Trey Gowdy , chairman of the House Select committee on Benghazi , has suggested he does not believe Clinton turned over all the Benghazi-related emails and had called on her to turn over her private email server so that a neutral party can examine it to see if there are other relevant emails that should be provided to the panel.The committee is also likely to grill Clinton on why at least four advisers occasionally used personal email accounts to liaise with her , the Times said . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

    "451": "Sprite has a new commercial coming to your TV screens . I 'll tell you right up front that I found it chilling .\nIt is a supposedly sympathetic , loving spot where parents indulge their children 's transgender fantasies that they can actually be someone they were not born to be . One mother is seen binding the breasts of her daughter in order to make her look more boyish . Another mother helps her son put on makeup before he goes out to meet his boyfriend .\nAll these `` loving '' images come with a beautiful music bed that tugs at your heartstrings - `` let there be peace on earth '' - while at the same time coaxes you to buy into what many doctors and psychiatrists are saying is a mental disorder . And nowhere , by the way , do you see anyone taking a sip of Sprite .\nSince when did enabling people - especially children - in their confused mental state become `` loving '' ? Much less become a vehicle to sell soda ? I know what many of you are thinking . Like me , you say it 's gotten so crazy out there , sometimes you just want to try to escape , stick your head in the sand , and ignore what 's going on . But that 's just not possible anymore .\nHere 's what 's going on : the so-called `` influencers '' of our society - the media , Hollywood , the schools , your `` enlightened '' businesses - are in a determined , organized , deliberate effort to foist the most toxic and destructive behaviors on us as normal and good . And we can not hide from it . Instead , we must resist it with the truth .\nThe transgender lie - and it is a falsehood - says you are not the gender you were born as biologically ; instead , you are the gender you think you are and want to be .\nThat belief has led to the promotion of medical procedures and hormone treatments for kids to `` transition '' from one gender to another , including puberty blockers , opposite-sex hormones , and finally , surgical removal or altering of genitalia .\nREAD : Teen Who Had a Sex Change Says He Now Feels Like a 'Frankenstein '\nBut these procedures and the propaganda push for acceptance of trangenderism as normal , like this Sprite commercial , come at a time when a rising chorus of doctors and psychiatrists say `` transitioning '' is destructive and dangerous for children .\nDr. Michael Laidlaw , an endocrinologist based in Rocklin , California , says medical associations themselves have been subverted with trans propaganda not backed up by research .\nAs ███ News has reported , Dr. Laidlaw told The Christian Post that the Endocrine Society , Pediatric Endocrine Society , and the American Academy of Pediatrics have been taken over by the most radical elements of the profession .\n`` These radical trans activists were involved in writing the Endocrine Society guidelines in 2009 and 2017 . These are low to no quality evidence guidelines , and anyone can read for themselves the poor evidence they have for these treatments for children and adolescents . There is no long-term evidence for benefits for these treatments , '' Laidlaw stressed .\nREAD : 'Mom , I 'm Transgender ' : Parents Grapple as Trans Phenomenon Explodes\nCounseling used to be the first treatment for children confused over their gender .\n`` Until very recently , these children and adolescents were supported and cared for with counseling , '' Dr. Malone told the CP . `` With counseling , or even watchful waiting , an average of 85 % of these children would have a resolution of their distress by early adulthood . There are currently 10 studies in the medical literature demonstrating this . ''\nBut that kind of research is not what 's promoted by the trans activist ideologues in media or medicine .\nIn March , the United Kingdom 's The Telegraph reported that Oxford University professor , Dr. Michael Biggs , accused the National Health Service 's clinic for transgender children of hiding negative evidence about the effects of puberty blockers on children . Instead , Biggs claimed , the clinic is continuing experimental treatment on adolescents without solid evidence of its long-term effects .\nDr. Biggs ' own research suggests that after a year of treatment `` a significant increase '' was found in patients who had been born female telling staff that they `` deliberately try to hurt or kill myself , '' according to the Telegraph .\nBiggs says the evidence showed that `` Puberty blockers exacerbated gender dysphoria . Yet the study has been used to justify rolling out this drug regime to several hundred children aged under 16 . ''\nDr. Laidlaw equates the `` gender affirmative '' treatment now in vogue with brainwashing young children . They are psychologically damaged by puberty blockers , he believes , and then made even more confused , depressed and even psychotic by cross-sex hormones , according to the CP .\n`` The puberty blockers are a drug-induced model of not only blocking essential aspects of development but also solidifying the belief that they must take wrong sex hormones to escape from their situation . These wrong sex hormones are very dangerous and have blood clots , cardiovascular , and cancer risks . ''\nDr. John McHugh , a distinguished professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University , calls this chemical treatment of minors who are uncomfortable with their birth sex `` reckless and irresponsible . ''\n`` Many people are doing what amounts to an experiment on these young people without telling them it 's an experiment ... You need evidence for that , and this is a very serious treatment . It is comparable to doing frontal lobotomies . ''\nMcHugh believes there could be a link between feelings of transgenderism and poor mental health .\n`` I think their mental problems , often depression , discouragement , are the things that need treatment , '' he said . `` I 'm not positive about this . It 's a hypothesis , but it is a very plausible hypothesis , and it would explain why many of the people who go on to have treatment of their body discover they are just as depressed , discouraged , and live just as problematic lives as they did before , because they did not address the primary problem . ''\nAdditionally , McHugh referenced the results of a 2018 study that would indicate a cautious approach to treatment is a better option . The study was reportedly censored by Brown University in Providence , Rhode Island , after the survey 's lead researcher , professor Lisa Littman , discovered a `` contagion effect '' with transgenderism among children .\n`` In on-line forums , parents have been reporting that their children are experiencing what is described here as 'rapid-onset gender dysphoria , ' appearing for the first time during puberty or even after its completion , '' wrote Littman , an assistant professor of behavioral sciences at Brown . `` The onset of gender dysphoria seemed to occur in the context of belonging to a peer group where one , multiple , or even all of the friends have become gender dysphoric and transgender-identified during the same timeframe . ''\nGender confusion among young people , McHugh said , is `` mostly being driven by psychological and psychosocial problems these people have , '' which , he added , `` explains the rapid onset gender dysphoria Lisa Littman has spelled out . ''\nWith that in mind , what effect will this Sprite commercial have on suggestive children ? How many will be beset by this `` contagion effect '' and suddenly think they must be transgender ?\nWith all the scientific reasons not to promote trangenderism in medicine or on TV , maybe it 's time to remember one more -- Genesis 1:27 :\n`` And God created man in His own image , in His own image created him ; male and female He created them .

In the Tuesday op-ed , Swisher called for Twitter to remove Trump ’ s tweets about Lori Klausutis – who was found dead at her desk while working as an intern for Scarborough ’ s congressional office in 2001 . It was determined that Klausutis died of natural causes .\nSwisher pointed out “ the very serious collateral damage ” of the apparent war between Scarborough and Trump , which often results in the president bringing up Klausutis . The op-ed included a letter sent by Klausutis ’ husband to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey urging the platform to remove the president ’ s tweets , where he has pushed a theory suggesting Scarborough had something to do with the 28-year-old ’ s death .\nCo-host Mika Brzezinski began the segment by reading widower Timothy J.

    "454": "In their desperation to get back to work , some Americans are taking to the streets to demand that the government end the quarantine . Comedian Patton Oswalt is unsympathetic .\n`` Anne Frank spent 2 years hiding in an attic and we 've been home for just over a month with Netflix , food delivery & video games and there are people risking viral death by storming state capital buildings & screaming , 'Open Fuddruckers ! ' '' he tweeted on Saturday .\nThis is hardly Oswalt 's first display of smug liberal condescension : His tweet denouncing Covington Catholic High School student Nick Sandmann as a `` leering , privileged little shit '' was one of the most vile celebrity attacks on the wrongly maligned teenager .\nIt may be trivially simple for the Emmy Award-winning comic—and voice of Remy in Pixar 's Ratatouille—to stay at home , watch Netflix , order carry-out , and play video games for a few weeks . ( Writer and podcaster Bridget Phetasy compared Oswalt to Marie Antoinette 's apocryphal indifference toward the hungry masses , tweeting : `` Let them eat kale ! '' ) But many auto mechanics , coffee baristas , and small business owners ca n't afford this so easily . They are watching their financial situations become more and more precarious with each day that extreme social distancing continues . Oswalt suggested that the uncultured rubes are crazy to want Fuddruckers to reopen ; people whose livelihoods depend upon places like Fuddruckers might see things differently .\nThat 's why it 's important for those criticizing misguided protesting efforts—including media figures who increasingly appear to be taking the view that you would have to be a deranged right-winger to want social distancing to end—not to resort to sneering at the less fortunate . ( For example : A guest on MSNBC recently called the protesters , `` the Fox News Nazi confederate death cult rump of the Republican Party . '' ) These are terrifying times , and the prospect of hundreds of thousands of deaths means there is very good ███ for policymakers to proceed cautiously with reopening . But both federal and state governments must consider the long-term practicality of their coronavirus prevention plans , including whether people will be willing to obey stay-at-home orders for much longer .\nWhile these efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 remain broadly popular , some Americans are understandably growing frustrated . Protests have cropped up in several states—most notably Michigan , where opposition to the draconian quarantine dictates of Gov . Gretchen Whitmer ( D–Mich . ) culminated in a drive-through protest of the state capitol last week . Many of the protesters did indeed maintain social distancing , stayed in their cars , or wore masks , though some of the attendees—zanier right-wing types—did not .\nPolitical protests , be they left-leaning or right-leaning , always invite an eclectic crowd : from concerned citizens motivated by legitimate frustrations to professional activists desperate to attach a pro- or anti-Trump spin to seemingly any cause . Their tactics , goals , and organizational structure often attract well-deserved criticism : Some of the lockdown protests , for instance , seem to be generically pro-Trump in character , disconnected from the reality that thus far President Donald Trump has supported the shutdowns at every critical juncture . Indeed , it 's quite odd to hear protesters chanting `` Fire Fauci '' while waving MAGA signs : Trump has praised Dr. Anthony Fauci incessantly and never fails to heed his advice , the media 's attempt to create a narrative of mounting tension between the two notwithstanding .\nBut there are legitimate grievances for protesters to air . Whitmer 's stay-at-home orders were , as ███ 's Billy Binion put it , a `` hot mess , '' prohibiting travel between residences ( even to relatively uninhabited areas ) , buying gardening supplies , and motorboats ( but not boats without motors ) . Authorities in New York City have called on people to report each other for failing to abide by the most stringent social distancing measures . People have been stopped , shamed , and arrested for merely going outdoors . Voluntary compliance with social distancing has been remarkable , but forcibly constraining every last person has diminishing returns , and is not a good use of government resources .\nThat does not mean the quarantine protesters are , as conservative pundit Stephen Moore put it , `` modern-day Rosa Parks .

    "456": "LAS VEGAS — Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid 's decision to retire next year leaves no clear successor in his home state of Nevada , where a popular Republican governor appears reluctant to change jobs and the pending loss of Reid 's clout in Washington is causing anxiety over who might replace him .\nAs of Friday , the list of potential candidates came down to Gov . Brian Sandoval and everyone else . The political centrist who was easily re-elected last year is likely to face intense pressure from national Republicans and business interests to pick up where Reid leaves off on Capitol Hill .\nSandoval did n't deliver an unequivocal `` no '' Friday but he made clear the 2016 contest was n't on his current agenda .\n`` My focus is in on Nevada , period . Politics can take care of itself , but right now I am absolutely laser-focused on getting my budget through and improving education in Nevada , '' he said .\nReid , the longtime Senate Democratic leader , quickly blessed former Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto to run for his seat , while Rep. Dina Titus , another Democrat , said she would consider a bid . Among Republicans , other possibilities are Rep. Joe Heck , Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt and former Lt. Gov . Brian Krolicki .\n`` The major decision will be made by Brian Sandoval , '' said political scientist Eric Herzik , who teaches at the University of Nevada , Reno . `` If he jumps in , this race tips overwhelmingly to the Republicans . ''\nThe Nevada campaign will inevitably figure in the fight for control of the Senate . In a video statement Friday , Reid said Democrats must retake the majority and `` it is inappropriate for me to soak up all those resources '' to defend his seat .\nAwkward in public , clumsy with words , the 75-year-old Reid never was a beloved figure at home . He survived a brutal re-election campaign in 2010 , when angry voters turned on him in the aftermath of the recession . He 's been in the Senate since the Reagan era .\nBut he helped deliver victories for President Barack Obama , including on national health care reform , and his name is affiliated with a long string of wins in Nevada , from development on the Las Vegas Strip to Yucca Mountain , which he helped stop after it was approved by Congress as a nuclear dump in 2002 .\nReid lost his role as Senate majority leader when last fall 's elections swept Republicans into power . He suffered serious eye and facial injuries on New Year 's Day while exercising at his Nevada home .\nLas Vegas native Daniel Bastardo , smoking a cigarette during a break from his casino security job , said it was going to be hard to replace the man who proved Sin City was worthy of political respect .\n`` You got ta hang up your hat at some point , '' said the 28-year-old Democrat , understanding Reid 's desire to retire . `` I 'm worried who 's going to represent us now . ''\nThe sense of looming loss was felt around the state . With Reid 's pending departure , Nevada will be without its most experienced hand on Capitol Hill . Sen. Dean Heller , R-Nev. , has been in Washington for several years in a chamber where seniority equals influence , and the state 's House members are relative newcomers in a body where members sometimes serve decades .\nSig Rogich , an influential Nevada Republican who helped Reid defend his seat in 2010 , said `` you do n't lose him and not expect to feel the void . '' The Nevada Mining Association said the state would `` miss having this native son in its corner . ''\nThe contest will play out in a state in which Democrats hold an edge in registration but voters have long displayed an independent streak . Obama was a two-time winner , but the state also helped send Republican George W. Bush to the White House twice .\nDemocrats are anchored in the Las Vegas region , while Republicans have an edge in rural parts of the state . A fast-growing Hispanic population is gradually reshaping the electorate , similar to other states in the West , including California .\nA major factor in the coming election will be the casino industry , which has a long history ignoring party labels and picking winners in Nevada politics .\nJan Jones Blackhurst , an executive vice president at Caesars Entertainment , called Reid `` irreplaceable . '' Reid won broad support from the industry in his 2010 victory over tea party favorite Sharron Angle , a Republican .\nFinding the right successor , she said , is `` a big issue and big concern . ''\nWith Reid 's influence , `` all of the sudden Nevada mattered , '' she added . With his exit , `` that 's going to be a challenge for the state . ''\nThe 2016 presidential race will also intertwine with the Senate contest , potentially driving up turnout among key voter groups , including Latinos .

The two pushed anti-Semitic theories , claimed black people are unable to be anti-Semitic because “ the Semitic people are black people. ” Cannon also said “ white people ” and Jewish people are “ the true savages . ”\nFox confirmed that Cannon “ is clear and remorseful that his words were wrong ” after the host issued an apology Wednesday . The network added that it “ will move forward with Nick and help him advance this important conversation , broadly . ”\n“ When we were made aware of Nick Cannon ’ s interview with Richard Griffin on YouTube , we immediately began a dialogue with Nick , ” Fox wrote in a statement to ███ . “ He is clear and remorseful that his words were wrong and lacked both understanding and context , and inadvertently promoted hate . This was important for us to observe . ”\n“ Nick has sincerely apologized , and quickly taken steps to educate himself and make amends .

FOX condemns all forms of hate directed toward any community and we will combat bigotry of any kind . ”\nViacomCBS , on the other hand , terminated its relationship with Cannon after the commentary , saying in a statement that it “ condemns bigotry of any kind. ” The statement added that ViacomCBS is “ deeply troubled that Nick has failed to acknowledge or apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism . ”\nCannon ’ s apology Wednesday came after first refusing to do so . The host demanded an apology from ViacomCBS and ordered the company give him full ownership of the comedy show “ Wild ‘ N Out. ” Cannon also posted a statement on Facebook that many deemed insufficient , saying that “ anyone who knows me knows that I have no hatred in my heart or malicious intent . ”\nFollowing backlash from that statement , Cannon again refused to apologize in an interview with Fast Company , saying that “ apologies are empty. ” ( RELATED : Superstar Nick Cannon No Longer Getting His Own Late-Night Show )\n“ Are you forcing me to say the words ‘ I ’ m sorry ’ ? ” Cannon said in that interview . “ Are you making me bow down , ’ cause then again , that would be perpetuating that same rhetoric that we ’ re trying to get away from , ” Cannon says . “ What we need is healing .

The video of this interview has since been removed .

I want to assure my Jewish friends , new and old , that this is only the beginning of my education—I am committed to deeper connections , more profound learning and strengthening the bond between our two cultures today and every day going forward .\nCannon also announced Thursday that he would be taking time away from his morning radio show so he can “ commit ” himself “ to deeper , more thorough reflection and education. ” He has been backed by multiple prominent figures such as radio host Charlamagne tha God and rapper Sean ‘ Diddy ’ Combs . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "458": "The FBI ’ s top agent on the Trump-Russia investigation sent a text message last year that one top Republican senator says suggests he saw no evidence of Trump campaign collusion .\nThe text message , which was sent by Peter Strzok , is “ jaw-dropping , ” Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson , the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee , said in a radio interview on Tuesday .\nIn an interview with WISN-Milwaukee radio host Jay Weber , Johnson read aloud a May 19 , 2017 text that Strzok sent to Lisa Page , an FBI lawyer and his mistress .\nStrzok wrote : “ You and I both know the odds are nothing . If I thought it was likely , I ’ d be there no question .

Strzok joined that team , but was removed in July after the Justice Department ’ s inspector general discovered his anti-Trump text exchanges with Page .\nAs the FBI ’ s deputy counterintelligence chief , Strzok was picked in July 2016 to oversee the investigation into possible Trump campaign collusion with the Russian government . Prior to that , he was a top investigator on the Clinton email inquiry .\n“ I think that ’ s kind of jaw-dropping , ” said Johnson , a Republican , said of the Strzok text .\n“ In other words , Peter Strzok , who was the FBI deputy assistant director of the counterintelligence division , the man who had a plan to do something because he just couldn ’ t abide Donald Trump being president , is saying that his gut sense is that there ’ s no big there there when it comes to the Mueller special counsel investigation , ” he said .\nThe text message was included in 400 pages of text messages exchanged between Strzok and Page .

    "459": "Multiple U.S. media outlets are citing an online survey by the Southern Poverty Law Center ( SPLC ) as proof Donald Trump ’ s election is causing a surge of bullying in schools . But the survey is flawed in several obvious ways , and shouldn ’ t be taken as proof of anything at all .\nEven before Trump had secured the Republican nomination for president , SPLC was aggressively promoting the idea that a “ Trump Effect ” was causing a rise in bullying in American schools . The claim was even repeated by Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail . Now , in the wake of Trump ’ s victory , SPLC is doubling down on the idea , using a survey of American teachers in which it asks them what has been happening in their schools since Election Day .\n“ The survey data indicate that the results of the election are having a profoundly negative impact on schools and students , ” SPLC said in a Monday report on the survey . “ Ninety percent of educators report that school climate has been negatively affected … A full 80 percent describe heightened anxiety and concern on the part of students worried about the impact of the election on themselves and their families . ”\nIf SPLC ’ s survey represented the genuine , nearly-unanimous sentiment of American teachers , it would warrant a great deal of concern . But the survey , in fact , isn ’ t even close to scientific . Instead , it ’ s simply a collection of anecdotes from a self-selecting group of teachers who are almost certainly on the political left and overwhelmingly hostile to Trump .\nSPLC ’ s own description of the survey is clear about its nature :\nThe results of this survey are not scientific . The respondents were not selected in a manner to ensure a representative sample ; those who responded may have been more likely to perceive problems than those who did not . But it is the largest collection of educator responses that has been collected ; the tremendous number of responses as well as the overwhelming confirmation of what has been anecdotally reported in the media can not be ignored or dismissed .\nThere are more than three million teachers in the United States . Despite SPLC ’ s rhetoric about the “ tremendous response ” to their survey , the 10,000 responses they received represents less than one-third of one percent of all teachers . Responses to the survey were solicited through left-leaning publications and organizations like Teaching Tolerance and the American Federation of Teachers , a major teachers union that was one of the first unions in the country to endorse Hillary Clinton for president . Unsurprisingly then , teachers who responded are likely left-leaning themselves , hostile towards Trump , and more likely to attribute negative events at school to some kind of “ Trump effect . ”\nBut beyond that , there isn ’ t even any guarantee that the survey respondents are real on a basic level . The SurveyMonkey survey used to collect SPLC ’ s data can be answered by anybody , and respondents can submit answers anonymously , using fake data , or while pretending to be somebody else . There ’ s also nothing to stop a person from responding more than once .\nBut these obvious flaws haven ’ t stopped the survey from being enthusiastically picked up by the media . Politico ’ s Morning Education newsletter said the “ vast majority of educators ” saw a negative outcome from the election ; it never noted the survey ’ s un-representative nature . NBC News , BuzzFeed , Vice , Newsweek , the BBC and more all made similar claims , simply repeating SPLC ’ s narrative without ever mentioning the survey ’ s clear shortcomings . None of the news sites listed above noted that the survey was unscientific , and some didn ’ t even note that SPLC is a left-leaning organization .\nIt ’ s possible that Donald Trump ’ s election has , in some cases , helped cause a surge in bullying . But SPLC ’ s survey is hardly strong proof of it , and citing it like it is is fake news . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

    "461": "Treasury Department Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs Monica Crowley has been vindicated by Columbia University after a years-long investigation ultimately concluded she did not plagiarize her thesis , despite allegations by CNN and other establishment media outlets that she did .\nCrowley , now the Treasury Department ’ s top spokeswoman but previously a Fox News contributor , had been under consideration to join the National Security Council ( NSC ) in the White House at the very beginning of President Donald Trump ’ s administration under his first national security adviser , retired Gen. Mike Flynn . Then , allegations from CNN and Politico , among other publications , claimed that she plagiarized her 2012 book and her thesis at Columbia , sparking Columbia to launch a review of her thesis that has now concluded .\nThe review found Crowley did not commit research misconduct , and sources familiar with the investigation added that the university is “ not disciplining her in any way. ” The university also , the source familiar with the details of the investigation told ███ , found no research misconduct by Crowley . She encourages the public to read her PhD dissertation—which is about U.S.-China relations—because it is a clearly newsworthy topic and added she is proud of her work .\n“ After CNN and other news outlets falsified my PhD dissertation by omitting nearly 40 footnotes , Columbia University began a process to review the work , ” Crowley told ███ on Friday afternoon . “ I am delighted that they have concluded that there was no research misconduct , as I have maintained all along . I was also happy to address any inadvertent and honest errors and update the work . I am extremely proud of the dissertation , particularly given the fresh timeliness of its subject—the U.S.-China relationship—and hope that others will read and appreciate it . ”\nA source familiar with the matter told ███ that the university ’ s use of the word “ plagiarism ” in its statement is a purely academic definition , and not the widely accepted use of the term .\n“ In 2017 , concerns were raised about potential plagiarism in this dissertation , ” Columbia University intends to state publicly about the review . “ Columbia University conducted a formal research misconduct investigation into the allegations , in accordance with its Institutional Policy on Misconduct in Research . The investigation was completed in 2019 . The investigation identified localized instances of plagiarism , but concluded that the preponderance of the evidence did not support a finding that Dr. Crowley committed research misconduct . For the dissertation to stand , the University required certain corrections , which Dr. Crowley has provided . ”\nIn other words , the review did find she could have sourced a few things slightly more , and she has offered to make additional annotations—an offer the university has accepted , sources familiar with the matter told ███ .\n“ They ’ ve accepted her offer to revise the dissertation with additional annotations , ” a source with direct knowledge of the investigation ’ s details said . “ The University has accepted that and concluded their investigation . ”\nOverall , the attacks from the establishment media—in particular CNN ’ s Andrew Kaczynski and a separate Politico piece—which claimed she engaged in wide-scale plagiarism were deemed untrue by the Columbia University review . A source familiar with the investigation added that it seems as though the political biases of those in media behind these smears of Crowley were a driving motivator of the attacks against her .\n“ This all started because this CNN guy had an axe to grind against Trump and anybody affiliated with Trump , ” the source , who is familiar with the details of the investigation , added . “ At the time , Monica was being considered to be Flynn ’ s deputy at the NSC . Kaczynski went after Monica because she was an easy target and had a paper trail . Once it went into the news , Columbia had to do an inquiry . They did an inquiry and appointed a committee . Universities are like molasses , they take an enormous amount of time to do anything . This took a long time to do anything . At the end of the day , she was vindicated—there were some footnotes she could have done better , but these corrections are minor . ”\nA Trump administration official added that the media and American political left have shown their true colors throughout the administration ’ s tenure but that Crowley was “ patient zero ” in fake news attacks on Trump administration officials .\n“ Monica was patient zero in the ongoing war between the president and those on the left and in the media that wish to impede his agenda by any means necessary , ” the administration official said . “ Nothing is beneath these people and their derangement is so extreme that I expect they ’ ll be going through Monica ’ s trash next . I am beyond thrilled to see Monica vindicated by this review , and I look forward to watching as she continues to communicate the president ’ s outstanding economic agenda . She ’ s a fighter who will continue to fight on behalf of this president against the Fake News media , as well as in the best interests of the American people . ”\nTwo former Trump White House officials added that the fake news media should be ashamed of themselves .\n“ The media and enemies of President Trump simply can not stand a strong woman serving in the Administration , so they peddle fictitious allegations and outright lies with no regard for what is actually true , ” one former White House official said . “ Monica is a world class talent that serves her country well . We need more people like her , not less . ”\n“ Monica is a driven and intelligent public servant whose name was senselessly under attack from day one of the administration , ” a second former Trump White House official added . “ This proves that she ’ s an effective messenger who poses a threat to the totally unhinged left who will stop at nothing to tarnish the name of anyone associated with the president . I ’ m glad that justice has prevailed as this marks another blow to the heart of the left and its manufactured resistance . ”\nAfter ███ broke the news of Crowley ’ s vindication , the New York Times published its own story on the matter–which some GOP officials have noted does not cite the fact that ███ broke this story before the Times :\nYour story doesn ’ t mention that this was first reported by @ BreitbartNews .

    "463": "There is a profound difference between ( i ) the soap-opera charges now being leveled by some opportunistic women against President Donald Trump and leveraged for cheap political gain by the Gillibrand Hypocrites within the Democrat Party and ( ii ) the pants-dropping of The Icon , John Conyers , and the butt-squeezing , tongue-slithering obscenities of Sen. Al Franken ( who now indeed will have to leave the upper chamber , with no Roy Moore to counterbalance ) . Conyers and Franken have lost all legitimacy . By contrast , the American people elected President Trump with full transparent cognition of his public and private portfolio , thereby validating his office .\n1 . Personal Character Allegations Were Litigated Fully with Transparency in 2016 , and the Voters Acted as Jury .\nThe difference between the President and Disgraced Franken-Conyers is that the charges against President Trump fully were litigated before the voters during the 2016 Presidential election . We heard the Billy Bush trailer tape . We read the New York Times front-page stories quoting former beauty contestants — some of whom rebutted the allegations and quotes ascribed to them . The voters knew all about it . And , fully apprised , the American people elected Donald Trump to be President .\nThat is how democracy works . Each side sets forth its best case — which , unfortunately , consists mostly of setting forth the other candidate ’ s worst case . There are ads , robocalls , newsmedia exposés and dirt-excavations , and finally debates during which each side gets to throw at the opponent all the dirt , mud , slime , grime , feces , and other schmutz their advisers can get their hands on . Before the debate they shake hands and promise to come out fighting clean . By the end , they not only need to soak their limbs with hand sanitizer but also to drink half a bottle of the stuff .\nWe knew all the filth about Hillary Clinton : her lies , her federal spoliation crimes that still await a fair and proper investigation and prosecution , her two-faced deceitfulness , her role in the Benghazi murders of American heroes and her attempted cover-up , her conniving lying to the bereaved widows and parents of the fallen , her role in approving the transfer of American nuclear material to Vladimir Putin even as her better half got paid $ 500,000 for some reason , her $ 125,000 honoraria for clandestine 15-minute speeches on Wall Street , her utter physical collapse on a Manhattan street on September 11 , the false story of how she was named at birth for Sir Edmund Hillary , the lie that she arrived in Bosnia heroically under gunfire , her episode of screaming for half an hour at the Prime Minister of Israel and deeming Jewish home-building in East Jerusalem to be illegal , her presiding over the fall of the Crimea thanks to her “ reset button , ” her disastrous endorsement of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and of other calamitous multi-lateral trade agreements that worked against American workers , her promise to put coal workers out of jobs , her refusal to approve the Keystone pipeline , her giggles remembering the time she helped an admitted child rapist go free , her prior experiences with Whitewater and Cattle Futures and Travelgate and character-assassinating women whom her better half raped or otherwise sexually molested , her calling 63 million good hard-working Americans a “ basketful of deplorables , ” her bleaching her computer hard drive that she had secreted in a bathroom in her home , her playing the race card , her playing the gender card ( “ Deal me in ! ” ) , her playing the ethnicity card , her ignoring Wisconsin , Michigan , and other Rust Belt states while foolishly campaigning to run up the vote in Sunny California where her Harvey Weinstein crowd of Hollywood sycophants pumped her full of bucks after long days on casting couches .\nThat is what a Presidential election or any election is . We saw all the Hillary we could stomach , and we likewise saw the good , the bad , and the ugly of Donald Trump . We heard the Billy Bush tape played so often , night and day , day after day , on the leftist mainstream media that we would have mistaken it for the National Anthem — but for the fact that Colin Kaepernick did not take a knee when it aired . We saw a lifetime of Republican Crowd Debates , and we saw Trump ’ s good side , his ridiculous side , and the side from which we recoiled . We heard and saw Marco Rubio take his best shots at Trump , John Kasich take his best shots , and all the others from Carly Fiorina — what in the world was she ever doing there ? — to Rand Paul to Ted Cruz take their best shots . The election unfolded as it did , and the American people as jury rendered their verdict , choosing Donald Trump to be the 45th President of the United States .\n2 . The Hillary Whiners and Democrat Sore Losers Have Rejected the Voters ’ Clear Choice with Blind “ Resistance ” for a Year by Pursuing Cynical Scheme After Cynical Scheme to Sabotage the Duly Elected President .\nFrom the day Mr. Trump was elected , the Democrats have concocted one ruse after another to sabotage the democratic will of the American electorate . First they challenged the authenticity of the vote counts . After Trump gained votes during many of the recounts , they shifted course and appealed to members of the Electoral College to violate their sworn oaths and vote for the loser . Then , when the Electors stood by their pledges of honor and elected Donald Trump to be the 45th President of the United States , they challenged the very legitimacy of the Electoral College itself . Then they tried to get celebrities not to perform at the Inauguration . In the alternative , they showed up in their puerile vagina hats , with faux courage saying that they contemplated blowing up the White House . Then they tried to prevent his cabinet choices from being approved . Then they tried blackballing his Supreme Court selection to serve as the next United States Justice . They brazenly emblazoned themselves “ The Resistance. ” They blocked and delayed every Presidential appointment possible . Every time he issued an executive order , they forum-shopped in Hawaii or San Francisco to find a federal judge appointed by Obama or Clinton to block the order , knowing that the injunction would be affirmed by the liberal United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit . They went on television , mocking his penchant for tweeting 140 characters to the American people several times daily , as he bypassed their biases and leveraged new technology to articulate his thoughts directly to the public , unfiltered . They said that he spends all day tweeting when he merely was sending out 500-2000 typed characters daily , consuming less time than a fifteen-minute salsa in front of Raul Castro . Then they called him an anti-Semite because of bomb threats anonymously dialed into Jewish Community Centers — as it turned out , phoned in by a mentally ill teen calling from Israel . They never apologized even though he issued warm statements on Jewish holy days , sensitively memorialized the Shoah ( Nazi Holocaust ) , ended eight years of the Obama-Clinton-Kerry Hell that saw Israel constantly attacked from a Washington that even allowed Israel to get gang-banged at the United Nations Security Council . They still were calling him an anti-Semite even as he announced finally that the 1995 near-unanimous law of Congress would be implemented , and America formally now recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and will move our Israeli embassy there from Tel Aviv . ( Indeed , his daughter is an Orthodox Jew , and several of his grandchildren thus are Jewish — something that many of his leftist Obama-supporting Jewish critics , to their shame , can not say . )\nThen the Democrats and left-liberals accused him of colluding with Vladimir Putin to throw the election . These Democrats who never regarded Putin as the problem , who mocked Republican warnings about the Soviets and their Russian successors for half a century , as conservatives pleaded for a stronger American posture amid Putin seizing Crimea and part of Ukraine . In the 2012 Presidential debates , Obama mocked Mitt Romney for deeming Putin a serious foe and obstacle to American values and security . And then suddenly , having run out of anti-Trump obstructions , the Democrats cynically reversed course and elevated Putin to the cause of all woe , the conspirator with Trump . For a full year they have been investigating the Trump White House , spending millions of our tax dollars on a Robert Mueller witch hunt , conducted by the Clinton Deep State All-Stars , a team of partisan Clinton Democrat sponsors and donors , and documented virulent Trump haters . And what has been discovered after a year ? That Paul Manafort conducted private business overseas and bought expensive clothes with his income . That Gen. Michael Flynn spoke with his Russian counterpart to discuss American-Russian national security concerns after the Trump election in the hopes of calming brewing tensions as the Trump succession team prepared to enter elected office . That James Comey leaked FBI documentary information to the New York Times through a professor friend at Columbia Law School , drafted an exonerating letter for Hillary Clinton before even concluding the rigged investigation that spurred her better half to meet on an Arizona airport tarmac for half an hour to discuss with Attorney General Loretta Lynch their common interest in golf , and even allowed a pro-Clinton/Trump-hating partisan to change the wording of the letter to mask Hillary ’ s statutory crime of “ gross negligence ” by altering it to “ extreme carelessness. ” And that a high-up guy in the Justice Department was in cahoots all along with the Fusion GPS Hatchet & Fertilizer Company that prepared the fake Trump dossier , while the guy ’ s wife was working all along in that company ’ s paid employ . And that the Hillary Clinton campaign paid for the libelous dossier . And that a guy named Podesta , Tony the bro of John , was involved in the sordid mix . That is what Mueller has found so far as his long-running show presumably qualifies for a “ Golden Globe ” nomination and prepares to be picked up for a second season after a summer of reruns .\nNext they said that Donald Trump is a racist . Somehow , while he had been in public life for half a century before , quite notorious in the public eye , ever the media darling and spectacle , no one ever before had associated him with racism . As he built hotels and casinos , as he hosted a crazy but adorably popular and kitschy reality television show , no one ever whispered “ racist. ” Somehow , no one — no Black leader , no White Democrat liberal , no one in half a century ever saw a racist bone in the loud , brash New Yorker . And it is not because he was admired like Mother Teresa or Father Damien . Everyone always knew about “ The Donald ” and his hubris , his screwy side . But no one , not even Jesse Jackson — who made his “ Rainbow Coalition ” fame and fortune by huckstering for payoffs and shaking down corporate executives with threats that he would boycott them as “ racist ” if they did not cough up moolah — ever called Donald Trump a racist . And then he got elected 45th President of the United States . And suddenly the epithet — racist .\nThe man honors Martin Luther King — and they call him “ racist. ” He goes to civil rights museums , and they call him “ racist. ” He meets in the Oval Office with presidents of Black Colleges , and they call him “ racist. ” If he goes to the Civil Rights museum to honor African American heroes and their struggle for equality and justice , then they will not go . But if he does not go , then they will go and say “ Look at how the racist did not come to the museum. ” For half a century , no one ever accused him of denying people employment or demoting them or underpaying them based on color , ethnicity , creed , or sexual preference . And suddenly the hypocritical likes of Nancy Pelosi , whose Congressional District population is less than ten percent African American , calls him racist .\nThey likewise called him fascist and compared him to Hitler . “ If Trump is elected , we will lose our freedoms and become a fascist Nazi country. ” Did Hitler visit Civil Rights museums and say that all Germans bleed the same red blood ? Did Hitler celebrate Chanukah in the Reichstag and invite rabbis to a telephone conference in advance of Rosh Hashanah to wish all Jewish citizens blessings for a good and healthy New Year ? When President Trump ’ s executive orders on immigration were stifled by liberal Democrat-appointed judges , did he have the judges arrested ? No , he grumbled and tweeted , but he honored the rule of law as laid out in the Constitution . As the Democrats , the “ Resistance , ” have attempted to sabotage his every step , has he had them detained ? No , he has tweeted . He has turned to the American public , exposing the plague of Fake News that permeates everything from the Washington Post ( tweeting half-empty stadiums ? ) to the New York Times ( watching eight hours a day of television ? ) to ABC ( Brian Ross ? ) to MSNBC ( all of it ) to CNN ( employees terminated for Fake News ) . He lives with the Fake News and unjustified smear jobs — Do we really care whether he drinks more Coke than Obama snorted ? — and he responds by appealing to his supporters , honoring the Constitutional process . We know the legislation he has wanted , but when the Republican Senate would not give him the votes , he had to postpone repealing and replacing Obamacare . When his proposed tax bill demanded horse-trading to pass , he traded horses . In every way , he has been the consummate Constitutional President , tested as no one since , yes , Lincoln and Andrew Johnson . They even have the temerity to question his sanity , his mental stability , his fitness under the 25th Amendment to hold high office , claiming that he slurred three words while delivering a teleprompter speech , even though he soon thereafter delivered a masterfully colorful , articulate , and wildly crowd-pleasing 80-minute speech to tens of thousands in Pensacola , Florida a few days later . It is not he but they who slur — him — and the mental examinations that suddenly excite them might first be tested on the likes of their own Maxine Waters to set a base score .\n3 . Now the Latest Despicable Outrage : The Cynical Attempt to Equate the President with the Disgraced Conyers and Franken , Hypocritically Led by Kirsten Gillibrand Who Has Built Her Political Base by Enabling Women Sex Abusers .\nRegard the parasitic Gillibrand Hypocrites who lived luxuriously off the rapacious Clintons until the Clintons had no more to offer them , who abided and chummed with Al Franken and his manifest obscenities until they saw greater value in dumping The Groper for the good of the team . Now these deceitful scoundrels aver that Trump should be challenged based on revived , yet stale , time-barred allegations from the kinds of women who never experienced what Juanita Broaddrick , Paula Jones , Kathleen Willey , or Monica Lewinsky endured at the seat of power .\nUnderstand that Kirsten Gillibrand was among the enablers and promoters of the Bill Clinton who sexually abused , physically assaulted , and even raped . We all knew . Everyone knew . Kirsten Gillibrand knew . “ I hope you ’ re as excited as I am that we have President Clinton here in Watertown ! ” she crowed at one campaign rally . The internet is filled with photographs of excited smiling Gillibrand clutching Bill ’ s hands or letting Clinton put his arm around her and laughing with him , exulting that she had spent time with him up-close campaigning alongside him . She knew exactly who he was and what he had done to physically abuse subordinate and defenseless women again and again . No wonder Clinton adviser Philippe Reines wrote about her : “ Over 20 yrs you took the Clintons ’ endorsements , money , and seat . Hypocrite . ”\nGillibrand is despicable in her two-faced position on “ defending women. ” Would you call a person who advocates female genital mutilation a “ woman-hating sex abuser ” ? If so , then Kirsten Gillibrand has empowered other women sex abusers . Consider : Linda Sarsour , a prominent hater on the Left , posted this about two Muslim women who publicly have decried radical Islamic extremists : “ Brigitte Gabriel = Ayaan Hirsi Ali . She ’ s asking 4 an a $ $ whippin ’ . I wish I could take their vaginas away — they don ’ t deserve to be women. ” Yet this vicious hater and female misogynist — imagine if Trump had said to Billy Bush “ I wish I could take their vaginas away ” — has been praised repeatedly by Gillibrand . On at least one occasion , Kirsten Gillibrand called this vicious woman sex-abuser “ [ one of the ] suffragists of our time. ” Gillibrand further beamed that “ it was an honor to write about ” Sarsour , praising her in a Time magazine cover story . An avalanche of angry attacks against Gillibrand followed on social media , and even the New York Times published an op-ed educating the public about the hate-filled Sarsour while noting in shock how Gillibrand had gushed over this female misogynist with admiration .\nThis latest Trump-bullying scheme will fail as have all the others . The effort to equate President Trump ’ s legitimacy with the disgrace of Conyers or Franken fails facially . One difference is that Al Franken went to the electorate with his groping background hidden from the voters , his hands in his pockets or stuffing ballots , and his tongue in his own mouth . John Conyers presented himself to the voters while wearing pants . Truly — truly — let Franken now go to the voters , and if they elect him to the Senate now , then touché ! Let Conyers present himself for an Election Day validation , and if validated — good for him ! Charley Rangel did it after being zonked by the House Ethics Committee , and he prevailed . Because that is how America works . It is a democracy , and the voters decide . The people speak and render their verdict as jury .\nAs of now , the people of Minnesota never have been asked whether they would elect to the Senate the Lingua Franken that we now all know . The Detroit voters never have been asked whether they would choose a Congressman who contracts his breeches .\nBy contrast , the American people indeed were presented with the clear understanding of who Donald Trump is , what his background is , where he failed in the past . They knew about and debated the corporate bankruptcies . They knew about Billy Bush in the trailer . And the people of the United States freely decided . He was elected with full transparency by a body-slamming 306-232 electoral college runaway . The issues were litigated fully , the jury returned with a resounding verdict for Trump . That case is closed , free of double jeopardy .\nLet the message be clear to the Gillibrand Hypocrites who enable sex offenders and gush over sex abusers , and to the Groping Democrat Phonies who have lived off the Harvey Weinsteins , Al Frankens , and iconic John Conyerses for all too long : Keep your hypocrisy-stained hands off our President . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "464": "U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May will respond to Donald Trump ’ s U.S. election victory by telling supporters of economic liberalization and free trade that they have to listen to the concerns of those who think such forces have more downsides than benefits .\nAt the Mansion House in London on Monday evening , May will give her first major speech on foreign policy since taking office in July . It will also be her first analysis of Trump ’ s victory last week . According to extracts released by her office , she ’ ll argue that “ change is in the air ” and that it is the job of politicians to respond to voters who are unhappy with changes in society .\n“ These people -- often those on modest to low incomes living in rich countries like our own -- see their jobs being outsourced and wages undercut , ” she ’ ll say . “ They see their communities changing around them and don ’ t remember giving their permission . ”\nWith voters worried about Trump -- a ComRes Ltd. poll found two-thirds of Britons thought his victory made the world a more dangerous place -- U.K. politicians are divided on how to respond . Jeremy Corbyn , the leader of the opposition Labour Party , attacked him as a populist who needed to “ grow up. ” Nigel Farage , who as leader of the U.K . Independence Party was a chief advocate in the campaign to get Britain out of the European Union , on Saturday became the first British figure to meet Trump since the election . He tweeted a picture of the two of them standing together , and said he found the president-elect “ relaxed and full of good ideas . ”\nMay has tried to plot a middle course . Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson skipped an emergency meeting of EU foreign ministers on Sunday to discuss the U.S. election . The prime minister will say that the concerns of voters are valid and deserve an answer .\n“ If we are to continue to make the case for liberalism and globalization , as we must , we must also face up to and respond to these concerns , ” May will say . “ If we believe , as I do , that liberalism and globalization continue to offer the best future for our world , we must deal with the downsides and show that we can make these twin forces work for everyone . ”\nIn a leaked memo reprinted by the Sunday Times , Kim Darroch , Britain ’ s ambassador to the U.S. , suggested that Trump might be “ open to outside influence if pitched right. ” He said that because his embassy had “ built better relationships with his team than have the rest of the Washington diplomatic corps , we should be well-placed to do this . ”\nOf immediate concern to Britain and the rest of the EU is Trump ’ s suggestions during his campaign that he had a cooler view of the NATO alliance and would look to improve relations with Russia . Jens Stoltenberg , the secretary general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , urged the U.S. against “ going it alone . ”\nBut Corbyn in this area called for a better relationship with Russia . “ There has to be a process that we try and demilitarize the border between what are now the NATO states and Russia , ” he said on the “ Andrew Marr Show ” on the BBC . “ So that we drive apart those forces . Keep them further apart in order to bring about some kind of accommodation .

I asked Jared and Paul to attend , but told them nothing of the substance . ”\nHowever , it is now being reported that Trump Jr. was told in an email before arranging the meeting that the Russian government was behind the damaging information , according to three NYT sources with knowledge of the email .\nThe email was allegedly sent by Rob Goldstone , a British reporter who helped Trump Jr. arrange the meeting back in June . According to the three sources , the email indicates that the damaging Clinton information came from the Russian government but does not indicate if they procured the information from the Democratic National Committee hack .\n“ Obviously I ’ m the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent… went nowhere but had to listen , ” Trump Jr. previously wrote in one tweet about the meeting .\n“ No inconsistency in statements , meeting ended up being primarily about adoptions , ” he said in another tweet , backing up claims he had made that his meeting with Veselnitskaya centered on Russian adoptions . “ In response to further Q ’ s I simply provided more details . ”\nGoldstone , who allegedly wrote the email to Trump Jr. , also denied knowing if the Russian government had anything to do with the information .

    "466": "FBI Director Robert Mueller on Thursday defended a pair of controversial government surveillance programs , telling Congress that leaking information on them harms national security .\nIn his last appearance as FBI director before the House Judiciary Committee , Mueller said that terrorists track leaked information `` very , very closely '' and that because of leaks `` we lose our ability to get their communications '' and `` we are exceptionally vulnerable . ''\n`` As to the individual who has admitted making these disclosures , he is the subject of an ongoing criminal investigation , '' Mueller said without naming Snowden .\nMueller added : `` We are taking all necessary steps to hold the person responsible for these disclosures . ''\nResponding to questions by committee chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte , R-Va. , Mueller said the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has approved the surveillance programs and they have been conducted in compliance with U.S. law and with oversight from Congress .\nThe revelation that the National Security Agency is collecting millions of U.S. phone records along with digital communications stored by nine major Internet companies has touched off a national debate over whether the Obama administration , in its efforts to thwart terrorism , has overstepped proper bounds by using intrusive surveillance methods .\nRep. John Conyers , the committee 's ranking Democrat , expressed concern that the two programs were too far-reaching .\n`` It 's my fear that we are on the verge of becoming a surveillance state , '' said Conyers .\nMueller is nearing the end of his 12 years as head of the law enforcement agency that is conducting high-profile investigations of the Boston Marathon bombings , the attacks in Benghazi , Libya , that killed four Americans and leaks of classified government information . Mueller 's last day on the job is Sept. 4 .\nOn Wednesday , Goodlatte said that when it comes to national security leaks , it 's important to balance the need to protect secrecy with the need to let the news media do their job .\nThe Justice Department revealed last month that it had secretly gathered phone records of The Associated Press and emails of Fox News journalist James Rosen in an effort to crack down on leakers of classified information .\nIn the past week , a 29-year-old contractor leaked National Security Agency documents on the agency 's collection of millions of U.S. phone records and the NSA 's collection of emails and other information that people transmit online to and from foreign targets .\nThat has touched off a national debate over whether the Obama administration , in its efforts to thwart terrorism , has overstepped by using intrusive surveillance methods .\n`` Over the past few years , we have witnessed troubling national security leaks and have learned that the Obama administration seems to be bending the rules in place that protect the freedom of the press in its investigations , '' Goodlatte said .\nOn Benghazi , Republicans accuse the administration of misleading the public about an act of terrorism in the heat of the presidential campaign by saying the Sept. 11 , 2012 , assaults on the U.S. diplomatic post grew out of spontaneous demonstrations over an anti-Muslim video . In the immediate aftermath , U.N . Ambassador Susan Rice described it as a `` horrific incident where some mob was hijacked , ultimately , by a handful of extremists . '' The White House says Rice reflected the best information available while facts were still being gathered .\nGoodlatte said the committee planned to find out more about the status of what the congressman called the FBI 's `` stalled investigation '' in Libya .\nGOP lawmakers also have questioned why the military could n't get aircraft or troops to Benghazi in time to thwart a second attack after the first incident that killed U.S . Ambassador Chris Stevens . Four Americans , including Stevens , died in the attacks that took place several hours apart .\nRegarding the Boston Marathon bombings , committee members want to know whether there was a breakdown in information-sharing between federal agencies , preventing the FBI from thwarting the explosions that killed three people and injured more than 260 .\nRussia 's internal security service , the FSB , sent information to the FBI about now-deceased bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev in 2011 . The Russians told the FBI that Tsarnaev , an ethnic Chechen Russian immigrant living in the Boston area , was a follower of radical Islam and had changed drastically since 2010 . Because of a subsequent FBI inquiry , Tsarnaev 's name was added to a Homeland Security Department database called TECS that is used by U.S. officials at the border to help screen people coming in and out of the U.S .\nIn January 2012 , Tsarnaev traveled to Russia and returned to the U.S. in July . Three days before he left for Russia , the TECS database generated an alert on Tsarnaev . That alert was shared with a Customs and Border Protection officer who is a member of the FBI 's Boston joint terrorism task force . By that time , the FBI 's investigation into Tsarnaev had been closed for nearly six months because the FBI uncovered no evidence that he was tied to terror groups .\nTsarnaev died after a shootout with police four days after the April 15 bombings . His brother , Dzhokhar , was charged in the bombings and is recovering from gunshot wounds at a federal prison hospital in central Massachusetts . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "467": "When it comes to # MeToo sexual misconduct issues , former Vice President Joe Biden , the Democratic Party 's presumptive 2020 presidential nominee , has made it no secret where he stands : automatically believe women .\n`` For a woman to come forward in the glaring lights of focus , nationally , you 've got to start off with the presumption that at least the essence of what she 's talking about is real , '' said Biden during the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh , who faced accusations that as a teenager he had assaulted a woman at a party .\nAs vice president , Biden played an important role in the Obama administration 's efforts to compel colleges and universities to take sexual violence more seriously—and to adopt policies that limited the due process rights and presumption of innocence for the accused . In recent years , his rhetoric on these issues has been in lockstep with # MeToo activists .\nDespite his public pronunciations on the subject of never touching women without their explicit verbal consent , Biden has previously faced accusations that he was too handsy with people . But now the former vice president is facing a much more serious accusation of sexual assault , from an alleged former staffer named Tara Reade .\nIt remains to be seen whether the mainstream media will assign Reade 's story as much credibility and importance as that of Christine Blasey Ford , the woman who accused Kavanaugh ; they certainly have not done so yet . In any case , supporters of Biden—as well as the candidate himself—should take this opportunity to reflect on whether automatic belief is a useful or practical approach for handling decades ' old claims of misconduct .\nReade describes herself as a `` California-based victim rights advocate and activist '' in her interview with the journalist Katie Halper , who has helped bring this accusation to light . Reade says she worked for Biden in the early 1990s and asserts that she was unambiguously assaulted by him in 1993 . According to Reade , he began kissing her without her permission , pushed her against a wall , reached under her skirt , and penetrated her with his fingers .\n`` He said 'come on man , I heard you liked me , ' '' Reade recalled to Halper in the interview . `` For me , it was like , everything shattered . I looked up to him , he was like my father 's age , he was this champion of women 's rights , in my eyes . I could n't believe it was happening . It was surreal . ''\nReade had already complained to her bosses about sexual harassment in Biden 's office—she said a supervisor had once asked her to serve drinks at an event because she had attractive legs—but had shared the more serious accusation against Biden with a few close confidants . She said she once tried to talk to a supervisor about what had happened , but this person shut her down before she could tell the whole story . She also said she filled out an official form detailing her assault , but does not know what became of it .\nA year ago , Reade—who supported the campaigns of Sens . Elizabeth Warren ( D–Mass . ) and Bernie Sanders ( I–Vt . ) —attempted to come forward with stories of sexual harassment in Biden 's offices . As detailed in an Intercept piece , she reached out to Time 's Up , a project of the National Women 's Law Center that provides support to alleged # MeToo victims . Time 's Up declined to assist Reade ; the organization 's official excuse was that a feud with a national political candidate could jeopardize their status as a 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) non-partisan group . But as The Intercept also notes :\nThe public relations firm that works on behalf of the Time 's Up Legal Defense Fund is SKDKnickerbocker , whose managing director , Anita Dunn , is the top adviser to Biden 's presidential campaign . A spokesperson for Biden declined to comment . The SKDK spokesperson assigned to Time 's Up referred questions back to the NWLC .\nThe mainstream media has given Reade little attention . She was interviewed on Hill.TV by Krystall Ball and Saagar Enjeti ( whose populist impulses often put them at odds with the establishments of both parties ) , but The New York Times , Washington Post , and CNN have all declined to cover the story thus far .\nThe anti-Biden left , however , has seized the opportunity . # IBelieveTaraReade was trending on Twitter on Thursday . Nathan Robinson , editor of the leftist publication Current Affairs , has criticized MSNBC and CNN for failing to cover the story .\nIt 's a really shocking interview and I 'm not sure how people can support Biden after hearing it . https : //t.co/BkzjVG9gq3 — Nathan J Robinson ( @ NathanJRobinson ) March 26 , 2020\nSanders supporters , of course , have every incentive to weaponize this last-minute accusation against Biden in an attempt to deny him the nomination . And Biden fans have every ███ to roll their eyes at these attempts ; they can write off Reade as someone who , at the very least , waited too long to tell her story , and was a supporter of rival campaigns .\nBoth sides have a point . Barring the emergence of some really credible documentation , it 's going to be nearly impossible to informally adjudicate—formal adjudication being absolutely impossible—the accusation . Too much time has passed .\nOn the other hand , the very recent precedent set by the mainstream media and mainstream liberals during the Kavanaugh episode is that all accusations should be revisited , no matter how old . Indeed , one could make a better argument for considering Reade 's accusation than Blasey Ford 's : the latter concerns behavior that occurred during the accused person 's teenage years in the early 1980s , whereas Biden allegedly committed his transgression while a sitting U.S. senator . And again , Biden himself has taken the position that we should believe women even if it takes them a very , very long time to come forward .\nIt seems unlikely the Reade accusation can sink Biden 's candidacy , but whether Democratic primary voters and the mainstream media are willing to air it out as they did Kavanaugh 's will tell us a lot about what `` believe all women '' actually means . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "468": "A lot of people are dunking on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange now that he 's been arrested by British law enforcement and will likely face extradition hearings to the United States on charges that he conspired with Chelsea Manning to `` commit computer intrusion '' on a U.S. government machine . Assuming the British authorities do go forward with extradition , it will almost certainly be years before the matter is settled ( and there 's a strong argument that Assange might walk in British courts ) . In the meantime , Assange has effectively traded exile in Ecuador 's embassy in London for a jail cell in the same city . As Robby Soave notes , prosecuting Assange for publishing leaked documents—something that media outlets do on a regular basis—would be very bad for press freedom .\nRegardless of how you feel about Assange as a person , there 's no question that WikiLeaks , founded in 2006 , has been central to starting a salutary era of forced transparency , a time when state and corporate actors have much more trouble keeping secrets . Forced transparency is bigger than WikiLeaks , of course . It 's one of the defining dynamics of our time , riding the same technological wave that gave us Napster and other innovations that disperse power and information in all sorts of unauthorized ways . But let 's give credit and praise where it 's due . The world is better for the fact that it 's harder than ever for governments to keep their own secrets .\nEarly exposés by the organization included documents from the Church of Scientology and East Anglia University 's Climate Research Unit . In 2010 , the organization came into its own by publishing a trove of documents given to it by Chelsea Manning , then an Army intelligence analyst . Among the things that came to light :\ngraphic video of a U.S. Apache helicopter killing Iraqi civilians and two Reuters journalists ;\n90,000-plus pages of military memos , now known as the Afghan War Diaries , that showed that the Taliban and the Pakistani government were in regular contact and that civilian casualties were far greater than the U.S. officially acknowledged ;\n400,000 pages of documents about the war in Iraq , including revelation of 15,000 unreported civilian deaths and brutal reprisals by Iraqi forces ;\ndiplomatic cables that showed a wide gulf between the U.S. 's public positions and private analysis .\nIn 2016 , of course , WikiLeaks also released hacked emails from John Podesta , Hillary Clinton 's campaign chairman , which unmasked various bad-faith dealings within the Democratic Party establishment .\nThere are legitimate questions about WikiLeaks ' relationship with the Russian government , but it 's the worst sort of whataboutism to argue that WikiLeaks ' revelatons about the United States government should not be taken seriously until it releases equally damaging material about , say , the Putin regime . The information it has shared about the United States is widely understood to be accurate ; calls for some sort of geopolitical balance does n't make the group 's revelations about our leaders any less true .\nIn 2017 , FBI Director James Comey said that WikiLeaks trafficked in `` public intelligence porn . '' Mike Pompeo , then CIA director and now secretary of state , went so far as to condemn Assange and WikiLeaks as enemies of the state . `` We can no longer allow [ Julian ] Assange and his colleagues the latitude to use free speech values against us , '' Pompeo declared at the Center for Strategic and International Studies . `` To give them the space to crush us with misappropriated secrets is a perversion of what our great Constitution stands for . '' Such talk was reminiscent of The Wall Street Journal calling Assange an `` enemy of the U.S. '' who should face the death penalty .\nSuch backward thinking is absurd . We wo n't be `` crushed '' if our actions are defensible . Assume the worst about Assange , who was first taken into custody in relation to sexual assault charges in Sweden that have since been dropped . We do n't need to praise the man to recognize that governments ' radical loss of control of secret knowledge is ultimately a very good thing—and one that is n't going away anytime soon .\nFrom 2010 , here 's a ███ video in which four experts grapple with the question , `` Is WikiLeaks a Force for Good ?

    "469": "The real unemployment rate ( the U6 figure ) has reached a 17-year low in record time . This is almost exclusively in response to the massive amount of regulations that the Trump Administration slashed beginning from his very first day in office . The tax cuts also helped to goose the economy . For the first time in more than a decade , the economy has reached truly prosperous levels for many Americans .\nNow , there remains much work ahead of the Trump Administration . Government spending is out-of-control ; the failure to repeal Obamacare has raised the cost-of-living on many Americans ; and the stratification between the wealthy and the poor remains at stratospheric levels ( though the positive economic situation will help to mitigate this division ) . Also , the effects — whether positive or negative — from the ongoing ( and escalating ) trade war with China have yet to be fully felt by the American economy .\nHowever , in the near-term , things are brighter for most Americans than they have been in decades .\nSo , how is it that the GOP is struggling to win the wave of special elections in 2018 ( and there seems to be some evidence that the general midterms in November will be a tougher race than , frankly , it should be , given all of the positive economic developments ) ?\nIn a Country of Coke or Pepsi , We Need RC Cola\nYou see , if the American political system were a parliamentary-style of government , rather than a presidential system , the Republican Party would be several different parties on the Right . However , because we live in such a binary political system ( where one must choose between Coca-Cola or Pepsi ) , the GOP is a tentpole party . The Democratic Party has similar cleavages — but they are nowhere near as divided and have far fewer differences between them .\nNo Republican believes the same thing . Some are Libertarians ( not very many , though ) . Others are conservative internationalists . Still more are conservative-nationalists . There are too many to list ; each one of them believes that their version of “ conservatism ” is the purest way — and they will fight to prevent any form of consolidation of the party lest it be under their direction .\nDonald Trump ’ s election , in particular , created massive dislocations on the Right . Depending on which type of Republican you ask , Trump is either a savior-figure or a Svengali-type villain . Therefore , the Republicans — despite holding all of the reins of power — are more divided and opposed to each other than ever before .\nThis is made especially true by the fact that Donald Trump himself — the great lightning rod of the party — is not on the ballot . So long as Trump ’ s name appeared as a voting option , enough people on the Right ( combined with the moderate , blue-collar , middle-class “ Reagan Democrats ” who allowed for Trump to penetrate the mythical “ blue wall ” in 2016 ) would materialize at their polling booths , and grant Trump a victory . But , with Trump only able to endorse candidates , the reason to vote for the GOP is less clear . The divisions dominate . They depress the vote at precisely the moment that the Left is galvanized ( and , paradoxically , this is made doubly so for those Republicans who either refused or did not secure Trump ’ s endorsement ) .\nOne would think , then , that the natural solution would be simply to generate votes from the “ Reagan Democrats ” who gave Trump his electoral victory two years ago . Unfortunately , though , those voters are disinclined to vote for your archetypal Republican . Most Republican candidates favor “ free trade ” and open borders . They are also seen as being the party of entrenched wealth that wants to kill grandma , take away Medicare , and make people homeless . Such voters are unlikely to support traditional Republican candidates .\nMore importantly , there ’ s the issue of morality . Conventional Republicans tell us that the social issues crowd needs to be drowned out ( especially in tight elections ) . They tell us that otherwise-magnificent candidates are destroyed because their great stances on economics and foreign policy are neutered by the fact that they tend to be weaker on social issues than the base is willing to countenance . As such , “ divisive ” candidates are put forward to appease the base . Yet , the Democrats have never gotten this message . At the very same time Republican Establishment-types get skittish over nominating candidates who will happily fight the Culture War , the Democrats are surging forward with their own take on the Culture War .\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez recently argued that the Democrats have the moral high ground on the major issues . She is not alone in this sentiment . In fact , most Millennials agree with her . They gravitate toward candidates on the Left who are the most extreme ( Bernie Sanders , for instance ) . While there is no guarantee that these democratic socialists will achieve electoral victory in 2018 ( or even in 2020 ) , the generational divide is key to understanding how Republicans are having such difficulty winning ( without Trump ) .\nAfter all , in 2020 , the largest cohort of Baby Boomers is set to retire and begin drawing on Welfare programs en masse . This will likely create massive economic distortions , as the debt explodes , and no one in Washington addresses the issue . As the situation declines , the radicalism exhibited by the Left will intensify and gain traction . Meanwhile , the Right will continue to lose influence and legitimacy , as it bickers among its various factions and ignores the massive grouping of blue-collar voters that catapulted Trump to victory ( as the GOP continues distancing itself from Trump and the issues of trade and immigration ) .\nGoing forward , the GOP needs to more fully embrace Trumpism ; it needs to unequivocally take up the issues of trade and immigration — and stand firm on them ( except in extreme cases ) . The GOP also needs to unflinchingly wage the Culture War .

Such a `` backdoor '' into security techniques would only be used when necessary and would be closely guarded so it would not fall into the wrong hands , the story goes .\nThe intelligence community does not yet have a known custom-built backdoor into encryption . But intelligence agencies do hold a trove of publicly unknown vulnerabilities , called `` zero days , '' they use to obtain hard-to-get data . One would hope that government agencies , especially those explicitly dedicated to security , could adequately protect these potent weapons .\nA recently released 2017 DOJ investigation into a breach of the CIA Center for Cyber Intelligence 's ( CCI ) `` Vault 7 '' hacking tools publicized in 2016 suggests that might be too big of an ask . Not only was the CCI found to be more interested in `` building up cyber tools than keeping them secure , '' the nation 's top spy agency routinely made rookie security mistakes that ultimately allowed personnel to leak the goods to Wikileaks .\nThe released portions of the report are frankly embarrassing . The CCI cyber arsenal was not appropriately compartmentalized , users routinely shared admin-level passwords without oversight , there seemed to be little controls over what content users could access , and data was stored and available to all users indefinitely . No wonder there was a breach .\nIt gets worse . Because the CIA servers lacked activity monitoring and audit capabilities , the agency did not even realize it was hacked until Wikileaks publicly announced it in March of 2017 . As the report notes , if the hack was the result of a hostile foreign government like , say , China , the CIA might still be in the dark about the hack . Might there be other unknown breaches that fit this bill ?\nThe report recommended several measures the CIA should take to shore up its internal defenses . Among the few that were not redacted : do a better job of protecting zero days and vetting personnel . Okay , so do n't make all of the same mistakes again : got it .\nWell , it looks like even this goal was too ambitious for the CIA . Intelligence gadfly Sen. Ron Wyden ( D–Ore . ) , who first publicized the report , wrote a letter Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe stating that `` the intelligence community is still lagging behind '' three years after the report was first published . He demanded public answers for outstanding security problems in the intelligence community , such as a lack of basic practices like multi-factor and email authentication protocols .\nWhat a snafu . It is absurd enough that the CIA of all places can not even implement basic password protection programs . But when intelligence hacking units can not even manage to protect its own hacking tools , our troubles multiply .\nThe CIA is unfortunately not uniquely incompetent among the intelligence community . The National Security Agency ( NSA ) found itself the victim of a similar zero day link in the 2016 Shadow Brokers dump . These are just two incidents that the public knows about . A culture of lax security practices invites attacks from all kinds of actors . We do n't know how many times such hacking tools may have been discovered by more secretive outfits .\nMany policy implications follow . There is a strong case to be made that intelligence agencies should not hoard zero-day vulnerabilities at all but should report them to the appropriate body for quick patching . This limits their toolkit , but it makes everyone safer overall . Of course , foreign and other hostile entities are unlikely to unilaterally disarm in this way .\nThe intelligence community supposedly has a process for vetting which zero days should be reported and which are appropriate to keep secret , called the Vulnerabilities Equities Process ( VEP ) . Agencies must describe a vulnerability to a board who decides whether it 's dangerous enough to need patching or useful enough for spying purposes .\nFor example , a vulnerability in some technology that is only used in China would probably be kept for operations . Theoretically , a vulnerability in some technology that is widely-used in the United States would be reported for fixing to keep Americans safe . As these incidents show , this does not always happen .\nThe VEP process is clearly insufficient , given these high-profile breaches . The very least the intelligence community can do is appropriately secure the bugs they 've got . Efforts like Wyden 's seek to impose more accountability on these practices .\nThere 's a more general lesson about government efforts to improve security and privacy as well .\nAs implied earlier , we should strongly resist government efforts to compromise encryption in the name of law enforcement or anything else . Some of the most technically savvy government bodies can not even secure the secret weapons they have not advertised . Can you imagine the attack vectors if they publicly attain some master encryption-breaking technique ?\nIt also demonstrates the weaknesses of many top-down proposals to promote privacy or security . Government plans often attempt to sketch out master checklists that must be followed perfectly on all levels to work well . They can be time-consuming and burdensome , which means that personnel often cut corners and shirk accountability . Then when disaster inevitably strikes , the conclusion is that `` people did n't stick to the plan hard enough , '' not that the plan was generally unrealistic to start .\nThere is n't a lot that the public can do about seemingly out-of-control intelligence agencies failing to secure potent cyberweapons beyond making a fuss . `` National security '' and all that . But it does give us a powerful argument against granting more power to these insecure intelligence bodies to break strong encryption . Governments ca n't even protect their secret cyber weapons . They almost certainly will not be able to protect a known backdoor into encryption . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "471": "The bombshell report that U.S. investigators conducted surveillance against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort before and after the presidential election has touched off a debate over whether President Trump was correct when he claimed that his predecessor , President Obama , ordered his “ wires tapped . ”\nTrump infamously made that accusation in early March in a highly controversial tweet .\n“ Terrible ! Just found out that Obama had my ‘ wires tapped ’ in Trump Tower just before the victory . Nothing found . This is McCarthyism ! ” Trump wrote .\nTrump was widely criticized for the comment , which was accompanied by no additional context or information . His defenders attempted to dilute the comment , suggesting that Trump was speaking generally about the Obama administration conducting surveillance on his presidential campaign for political purposes . ( RELATED : BOMBSHELL : Feds Wiretapped Paul Manafort Before And After The Election )\nTrump has since stopped discussing wiretapping , but CNN ’ s report could renew the Republican ’ s interest in the topic .\nThe network reported on Monday that U.S. officials probing possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government obtained a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) warrant on Manafort at some point last year . The surveillance lasted through early this year , when Manafort was said to still be in touch with Trump .\nAccording to CNN , investigators picked up communications from Manafort which suggested that he might have encouraged Russian operatives to meddle in the campaign . Two of the network ’ s sources cautioned that the intelligence was inconclusive .\nThough the report could bode poorly for Manafort and Trump — if Manafort ’ s communications show collusion — some conservatives cited the CNN report as a vindication for Trump .\nRoger Stone , a former business partner of Manafort ’ s and informal adviser of Trump ’ s , said that the new report overwhelmingly supports Trump ’ s controversial claim .\n“ The overwheming evidence is that Trump was also under surveillance , as he claimed overlapping with the time Manafort was being monitored , ” Stone told ███ .\n“ The fruits of the surveillance , ” Stone said , “ were used for political purposes ” against Trump .\nBut there has been plenty of pushback against the idea that Trump ’ s wiretapping claim was accurate .\n“ Nothing in this report vindicates Trump ’ s claims that he or Trump Tower were wiretapped , ” a group of prominent national security bloggers wrote at Lawfare .\nThe bloggers noted that nothing in the new report indicates that Trump was directly wiretapped or that Obama ordered it .\nBesides questions about the accuracy of Trump ’ s tweet , the CNN report raises new questions about why and when the FBI began targeting Manafort , who joined the Trump campaign in May and was fired in August .\nThe CNN report suggests that U.S. investigators obtained the FISA warrant after the now-infamous June 9 , 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Manafort , Donald Trump Jr. , Jared Kushner and a group of Russian lobbyists . As for why investigators sought the warrant , Ed Henry , a reporter at Fox News , cited sources who claimed that the uncorroborated dossier of research compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele may have been a catalyst for the FISA application .\nHenry reported that the warrant was obtained “ after the FBI embraced some of the details of that Russian dossier of then-President-Election Trump that has since been discredited. ” His unnamed sources also said that the federal judges who approved the warrant “ are privately miffed ” that the Manafort warrant was tied to the dossier , which was funded by a political ally of Hillary Clinton ’ s . If Henry ’ s report is accurate , Manafort would be the second Trump campaign figure for whom the dossier was used to obtain a FISA warrant . It has been reported that investigators cited the 35-page dossier in an application for a FISA warrant against Carter Page , an energy consultant who served as a volunteer on Trump ’ s campaign foreign policy team . In the dossier , Steele cites a source who claimed that Manafort and Page were part of “ a well-developed conspiracy of co-operation ” between the Trump campaign and Russian leadership to help Trump win the presidency . Manafort “ managed ” the effort , using Page and others as intermediaries , Steele wrote in a memo dated sometime in late July . The FBI reportedly opened its investigation of the Trump team at around that time . Steele had reportedly provided copies of reports in the dossier to FBI agents he knew from previous spy projects . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "472": "This past week , possible GOP 2016 presidential contender Jeb Bush doubled down on his support for the Common Core standards , scolding conservative critics of the controversial education reform by stating that he had “ lost patience ” with them and telling them they were not needed by moderate Republicans to win the White House .\nWith polls showing Republican support for Common Core plummeting , common sense would dictate that Bush call it a day with the nationalized standards , as has been done by other Republicans , such as Maine Gov . Paul LePage and U.S. Sen. David Vitter , who plans to run for governor of Louisiana next year .\nHowever , as a review of Bush ’ s history with the education initiative demonstrates , his interest in pushing onto the entire nation the reforms he introduced while governor of Florida – and his methods for doing so – have led his critics to claim he is more about big government crony capitalism than concern for children ’ s education .\nBush is the founder of several organizations that all play into a reported strategy that involves not only motivating “ the people ” at large for changes in education , but also using state education officials to administratively make some of those changes happen without the scrutiny or approval of the public .\nAs the founder and chairman of the Foundation for Excellence in Education ( FEE ) , a national group which states its ambitious mission is “ to build an American education system that equips every child to achieve his or her God-given potential , ” Bush tapped for CEO Patricia Levesque , his former deputy chief of staff for education , enterprise solutions for government , minority procurement , and business and professional regulation while he was governor .\nChiefs for Change is an affiliate of FEE and describes itself as a “ bipartisan coalition of current and former state education chiefs who believe that American public education can be dramatically improved. ” Current members of Chiefs for Change include Mark Murphy of Delaware , Tom Luna of Idaho , John White of Louisiana , Hanna Skandera of New Mexico , Janet Barresi of Oklahoma – who was defeated in the state ’ s primary election this year , Deborah Gist of Rhode Island , and Kevin Huffman of Tennessee , former education commissioner and ex-husband of controversial Washington , D.C. , schools chancellor Michelle Rhee .\nTony Bennett , the former Florida commissioner of education , who obtained that position after Indiana voters rejected his Bush-promoted reforms , is listed as a “ member emeritus ” of Chiefs for Change . As reported by conservative writer Michelle Malkin last year , Bennett stepped down from his Florida post in August of 2013 after the Associated Press reported he had interfered in charter school accountability ratings – better known as “ grade-fixing ” – in Indiana in the fall of the prior year . Malkin noted that mega-GOP donor Christel DeHaan , founder of DeHaan ’ s Christel House Academy charter school , benefited from Bennett ’ s maneuver that magically turned his charter school from a “ C ” to an “ A ” grade rating , despite abysmal math scores .\nAs it happens , some of the Chiefs for Change are also members of the Partnership for the Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers ( PARCC ) , one of the two federally funded interstate consortia that are developing tests aligned with the Common Core standards .\n“ Cronyism and corruption come in all political stripes and colors , ” wrote Malkin at Townhall . “ As a conservative parent of public charter school-educated children , I am especially appalled by these pocket-lining GOP elites who are giving grassroots education reformers a bad name and cashing in on their betrayal of limited-government principles . ”\nBush is also the founder and chairman of Foundation for Florida ’ s Future , a statewide group that says its mission is to “ make Florida ’ s education system a model for the nation . ”\nThose familiar with Common Core will note that FEE ’ s “ reform agenda ” includes college and career readiness ; digital learning ; effective teachers and leaders – a goal that observes the need to eliminate tenure and utilize student assessments to determine teacher performance ratings ; K-3 reading assessments ; outcome-based funding ; school choice ; standards and accountability – which includes “ high academic standards with their progress measured , ” and grading schools on an A-F scale .\nNot surprisingly , the reform agenda for Foundation for Florida ’ s Future is nearly identical to that of FEE .\nAdditionally , Bush has joined with former president of the pro-Common Core Fordham Institute Chester Finn and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Conservatives for Higher Standards , a group that promotes the Common Core standards but whose supporters still call themselves “ conservatives. ” Among the organization ’ s supporters are Sen. Lamar Alexander ( R-TN ) , soon-to-be head of the Senate committee that oversees education ; former Mississippi Gov . Haley Barbour ( R ) ; former U.S. Secretary of Education Bill Bennett ; Iowa Gov . Terry Branstad ( R ) ; Tennessee Gov . Bill Haslam ( R ) ; former Arkansas Gov . Mike Huckabee ( R ) ; and New Mexico Gov . Susana Martinez ( R ) .\nThe Fordham Institute , the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , and Bush ’ s national organization have all been awarded grants by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , the primary private backer of the Common Core standards .\nIn 2013 , Bush ’ s FEE itself received $ 3,500,000 from the Gates Foundation . Two million dollars of that was awarded to FEE “ to support Common Core implementation , ” and $ 1.5 million was “ for general operating support . ”\nIn 2012 , FEE received $ 151,068 from Gates , essentially for PR funding “ to complete a statewide communications campaign in Florida delivering the message on why there is a drop in school grades , why it is temporary , and how raising the bar on education standards leads to greater student success . ”\nThe year before saw a $ 1 million grant from Gates , once again “ for general operating support , ” and in 2010 , FEE was awarded $ 501,485 “ to launch the Digital Learning Council in an effort to bring digital learning to every school , every classroom , and every child . ”\nIn addition to the Gates Foundation , FEE ’ s donor list includes names not unfamiliar to critics of the Common Core standards : the GE Foundation , the Helmsley Charitable Trust , News Corp , the Walton Family Foundation , Bloomberg Philanthropies , Carnegie Corporation , the Schwab Foundation , Microsoft , Exxon Mobil , Paul Singer Foundation , Houghton Mifflin Harcourt , Intel , K12 , Pearson , Scholastic , and Target .\nBook publishers such as Pearson , Houghton Mifflin Harcourt , K12 , and Scholastic are all poised to reap billions off the sale of Common Core-aligned textbooks and instructional materials that school districts are forced to purchase if they want their students to succeed on the Common Core-aligned assessments . Similarly , technology companies will benefit from the online assessments and student data collection .\nAs the Tampa Bay Times reported in May , the potential market for textbooks and instructional materials required for Common Core is as much as $ 8 billion , according to the Fordham Institute .\nFEE ’ s board of directors includes Joel Klein , former New York City schools chancellor , and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice . Klein is now the CEO of Amplify , a subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch ’ s News Corp .\nIn January of 2013 , In the Public Interest , a project of labor advocacy group The Partnership for Working Families , published a press release in which it revealed emails between FEE and state education officials . The release stated the emails – all available for viewing and obtained through public records requests – demonstrate FEE was “ writing state education laws and regulations in ways that could benefit its corporate funders . ”\nIn the Public Interest claimed that FEE , sometimes working though its affiliate Chiefs for Change , “ wrote and edited laws , regulations and executive orders , often in ways that improved profit opportunities for the organization ’ s financial backers . ”\nCorrespondence between FEE and state education officials from Rhode Island , Oklahoma , New Mexico , Maine , Louisiana , and Florida revealed several findings , though it ’ s important to remember the source is a labor advocacy group whose goal is to keep teachers in jobs and funding flowing to public schools .\nIn New Mexico , In the Public Interest found FEE to have “ acted as a broker to organize meetings between its corporate donors and individual Chiefs , ” while in Florida , emails showed Bush ’ s organization helped to write legislation that would increase the use of a proprietary test – the FCAT – under contract to mega publisher Pearson .\nMaine ’ s legislature and governor , through executive order , approved FEE ’ s agenda , removing barriers to online education and , as In the Public Interest notes disapprovingly , “ allowing public dollars to flow to online schools and classes , ” and blocking the “ ability of local school districts to limit access to virtual schools . ”\nThe project group observes also that , in the emails , Levesque called upon state officials , such as state Superintendent Barresi of Oklahoma , to introduce SendHub , a communications technology tool , into the schools in their respective states .\nHowever , as Techcrunch reported in October of 2012 , Bush was an investor in SendHub :\nSendHub , the messaging startup backed by $ 2 million in seed funding from Y Combinator , Kapor Capital , Menlo Ventures , 500 Startups and others , is today announcing a highly in-demand new feature with the launch of Shared Groups , as well as a notable new investor : Jeb Bush , 43rd Governor of Florida . This is the first startup investment for the former Republican governor , and one which saw the politician approaching SendHub , instead of the other way around .\nThe report states that Garrett Johnson , who founded SendHub with Ash Rust in 2011 , “ first got his start in politics working for Bush and still serves on the board of one of Bush ’ s foundations , ” a reference to Foundation for Florida ’ s Future .\nJohnson reportedly sent Bush an article about SendHub , and Bush responded with whether there was an opportunity to invest . The amount of Bush ’ s investment was undisclosed , but “ in the five-figure range – neither at the low end or the high-end of the spectrum . ”\nIt ’ s somewhat unusual to see politicians playing the role of investor in early stage startups , but in Florida , area leaders have been pushing to see how the state can harness startup momentum to create jobs and boost the economy . There are even a couple of members in Florida ’ s legislature who have launched startups , Johnson points out .\nLevesque sent an email about SendHub to the Chiefs . Note her “ full disclosure ” is not quite so “ full ” :\nDear Chiefs for Change , If you have anyone on your agency staff who is assigned to provide assistance/support/communications for teachers in your state , please share this new service with them so they can share with your teachers . SendHub is a new mobile messaging system that will allow teachers to have easier , more effective communications with their students and parents . The system is free for teachers . Beauty of the system is that teachers will not have to give out their personal cell numbers to students/parents , but instead can get a free SendHub number that can be used for texting and/or voice communication… Patricia p.s . full disclosure , I know the creator of the system . Fine young man , FSU student , Rhodes scholar . He designed the system to help the teachers at his nephew ’ s charter school .\nBush ’ s interest in expanding his education empire came under recent scrutiny in September , when the St. Augustine Record reported that the St. John ’ s County School District found numerous “ errors ” in the charter application of New World Academy .\n“ I think we identified a number of errors in the application because it was a generic application that was applied to seven different districts , ” said Tim Egnor , executive director for curriculum services for the district . “ The numbers for enrollment didn ’ t make sense , the budget aspects didn ’ t make sense , and so now we see that those projections were probably for larger counties . ”\nAdditionally , district officials questioned a possible conflict of interest with corporations that were involved in New World Academy ’ s application process . Ultimately , the officials were unsure of who was backing the charter school ’ s application .\nAccording to the Record , Stephanie Velez , manager of operations for InterVisual Technology , had been appointed a board member of New World :\nInterVisual Technology is the parent company of InterVisual Education , which founded the iGeneration Empowerment Academy in Palm Beach County . The charter opened 11 days after the start of the 2013-2014 academic year and was shut down shortly thereafter . Representatives for New World said Scholastic Ventures Management Services , a Georgia-based company incorporated in July , would be the executive management office of the charter . Dana Williams , a board member for the academy , said Scholastic Ventures had gone through a series of different names and that it was finalized with the completion of the application , submitted to the district on Aug. 4 .\nGlobeNewswire reported in February of 2013 that RVPlus , Inc. , a holding company of ECCO2 Tech , a global green energy group , would partner with InterVisual Technology to expand the Liberia Institute for Global Studies ( LINGS ) , a green education program , throughout Africa , Micronesia , Asia , West Indies , and Latin America .\nAccording to GlobeNewswire , “ The projected sales revenue to be generated from the partnership with Intervisual Technology are in the billions due to eligible grants and debt financing from United Nations financial aid partners , who are encouraging the new addition to the ECCO2 Civil Society Programme . ”\n“ This deal has been in talks and in works for almost two years , ” RVPlus CEO Cary Lee Peterson said . “ There was much to negotiate and comprehend in the development stages of this engagement but I think now is the perfect opportunity to take our ideas into action to help educating the youth that will be taking care of the planet thirty to forty years from now , and generations to follow . ”\nIntervisual Technology ( “ IVTI ” ) , is an nationally accredited private school based in Florida with a physical campus , American High School located in Fort Lauderdale , engaging in educational services by physical and virtual classes for grade levels 6 to 12 , which offer cost effective solutions to students and school districts globally . IVTI has a current attendance of over 2,000 students that are located within the continental US and Hawaii , in addition to international programs operating in Africa and China . The company has projected sales revenue of over $ 10 million for 2013 from local , state , and federal contracts and is a women-owned business established in 2007 by founder and CEO , Dana Williams , inclusive to possessing several high profile supporters and board advisors such as John Ellis “ Jeb ” Bush , Jr. , who have enabled the school to establish robust business relationships and networks for investment and real estate opportunities .\nJeb Bush , Jr. , the Governor ’ s son , is chief operating officer at Jeb Bush & Associates and president of Bush Reality , LLC .\n“ Bush is also on the board of Intervisual , a blended charter school in Florida , Texas and Arizona , ” his bio states , “ a regional board member of the Hispanic Business Initiative Fund ( HBIF ) and a board member of the national Immigration Forum in Washington , D.C . ” \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "473": "The following excerpt is from Rogue Spooks : The Intelligence War on Donald Trump by ███ and Eileen McGann , published by arrangement with All Points Books , an imprint of St. Martin ’ s Press , a division of Macmillan Publishers .\nIt began with an unverified dossier compiled by Christopher Steele , the former MI6 spy who was hired by a U.S. opposition research firm and paid by Hillary Clinton supporters to find dirt connecting Donald Trump with the Kremlin during the campaign .\nIn retrospect , this highly flawed dossier was the catalyst that triggered everything else . A loss leader . False though it may have been , its allegations were sufficiently outrageous and sensational to attract the kind of nonstop media attention necessary to put the phony issue of a Trump-Putin arrangement on the front pages .\nWe still don ’ t know who was behind the dossier . We don ’ t know the identities of the Hillary supporters who paid for it . More important , we don ’ t know who actually made up the allegations that have been proven false and were passed to Steele . Who went to all that trouble ?\nIt seems unlikely that the Russians would implicate themselves , but they certainly might have . Was it rogue British—and/or U.S.—spooks ? Spies from other countries ?\nIf Steele played the main role in assembling the dossier , who brought it to the public ’ s attention ? There were a number of people who definitely helped out . But more than anyone else , it was former FBI director James Comey who insisted on bringing the unsubstantiated document to the attention of President Obama and congressional leaders , which ultimately led to its widespread publication . And he , more than anyone else , knew how unreliable the document was , but he passed it on anyway . The FBI had actually offered to pay Steele $ 50,000 to help them verify the allegations in the dossier . They ended up paying him expenses ( while he was still working for the Hillary supporters right in the middle of the campaign ) .\nWhen the New York Times reported that anonymous government officials alleged that Trump campaign associates had “ repeated contacts with Russian intelligence , ” Comey stayed on the sidelines and didn ’ t correct or clarify the story . Did the FBI know that the story wasn ’ t true ? According to the White House , it was Comey ’ s deputy , Andew McCabe , who had assured Trump ’ s chief of staff that the Times story was “ BS ” but who later reportedly said , “ We ’ d love to help but we can ’ t get into the position of making statements on every story . ”\nSo , with no comment from the FBI , the claims that Trump aides were frequently in touch with Russian intelligence entered into the bloodstream of the Trump-Russia story line .\nAnd , knowing that Trump was not under investigation , Comey deliberately leaked his own memos about his private meetings with President Trump , no doubt expecting they would trigger the appointment of a special prosecutor .\nWhy was Comey so invested in the anti-Trump dossier ? And how did his relationships with others help kickstart this massive investigation that got so out of hand and so off track ?\nThere is little doubt that Comey has an exalted self-image . Does he think he is the last good man on earth ? Sometimes it looks like that . Others in Washington may wallow in half-truths , evasions , and corruption , but sometimes it seems that Comey believes he stands like a beacon above them all , a model of honesty and integrity .\nIs he really that , or is he a headline hunter ?\nComey seems addicted to the limelight . His career has been a parade of revolving headlines , always with Comey center stage , accompanied by an adrenaline rush from the publicity and controversy . To the outside observer , he looks like he ’ s suffering from an inside-the-Beltway strain of attention deficit disorder ( ADD ) —when he doesn ’ t get enough attention , he becomes disordered .\nThe coup progressed when the unverified allegations in Steele ’ s dossier went public . But when Steele had first tried to pitch it to media outlets , he came up cold . They wouldn ’ t touch it without verification and proof .\nSo Steele and his colleagues asked Senator John McCain for help . With the senator ’ s intervention , Steele got the dossier to Comey . It was Comey who considered the dossier “ so important that he insisted the document be included in January ’ s final intelligence community report on Russian meddling in the U.S. election. ” That got it distributed to the president and leaders of Congress .\nComey had to know that the very act of giving a summary of the dossier to the president and Congress would lead to its leaking and publication all over the Internet . He once testified that he knew how Congress works—you give them something confidential and they leak it . So he was not blind to the likely consequences of his actions .\nOnce the dossier leaked , the other half of the new Intel/Media complex kicked in , as every major news organ breathlessly featured each new leak by the rogue spooks to give the impression that the president was nothing more than a desperate criminal trying to cover up his fraud during the election .\nTrump knew he had done nothing wrong and had been assured several times by Comey in private that he was not under investigation personally .\nBut all this noise was getting in the way of the real progress he wanted to make . He couldn ’ t be an effective president with this nonsense—which he knew had no basis in fact—obscuring his presidency . Confronted with this kind of false narrative overshadowing his administration , it was predictable that Donald Trump , activist that he is , would ask for a public affirmation of exactly what he had been told in private—that he was not under investigation . After all , he knew they wouldn ’ t find anything . That there was nothing to find .\nBut Comey did not comply with that request . Instead , Trump ’ s intervention created a new narrative : The president was obstructing justice . After Comey met with the president , he wrote a memo to himself about their discussion . In his telling , it sounded as if Trump had leaned on him to discontinue his investigations of former national security advisor Mike Flynn .\nBut that wasn ’ t the end of it . Comey , no stranger to the ways of Washington , leaked the memo through a friend to the New York Times .\nWe don ’ t have to speculate what his goal was . He explained it himself : “ I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel. ” He got fired in the process , but no matter , that goal was achieved : A special prosecutor was now inevitable .\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions—a loyal Trump friend—had already removed himself from the process surrounding the Russian investigation , and thus could not appoint a special prosecutor . Instead , it was done by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein , a step down in the food chain . He named Robert S. Mueller , former head of the FBI .\nBut Mueller has a problem—there is no evidence that the president actually conspired with Putin . Comey had already told Trump that he was not under investigation several times . Now , instead , the investigation shifted to whether Trump obstructed justice by asking his appointees to bring the Russia investigation to an end ( the same investigation in which he was not a target ) .\nAnd now , Mueller can use the license of the special prosecutor to probe any other crimes he comes across . Now Donald Trump ’ s entire life and all his business dealings will be open to scrutiny and prosecution by a special prosecutor .\nAlready , leaks are flowing into the media from what appears to be Mueller ’ s office , so that the president will be tried in the press before any issue gets to Congress .\nWhat a scenario for impeachment . What a way to plan a coup !\nFrom Rogue Spooks : The Intelligence War on Donald Trump by ███ and Eileen McGann , published by arrangement with All Points Books , an imprint of St. Martin ’ s Press , a division of Macmillan Publishers .

    "474": "In the wake of the Indiana donnybrook over religious liberty , which somehow was transformed overnight into a question of gay rights , it couldn ’ t be long before the New York Times weighed in against Christians .\nYet who could have expected the draconian measures the Times would propose ? Either Christians fully embrace the gay lifestyle , or you will be coerced into doing so .\nOp-ed writer Frank Bruni , onetime Times restaurant critic and a gay activist , has written that Christians who hold on to “ ossified , ” biblically-based beliefs regarding sexual morality have no place at America ’ s table and are deserving of no particular regard .\nIn one fell swoop , Bruni trashes all believing Christians as “ bigots , ” saying that Christians ’ negative moral assessment of homosexual relations is “ a choice ” that “ prioritizes scattered passages of ancient texts over all that has been learned since — as if time had stood still , as if the advances of science and knowledge meant nothing . ”\nIn other words , if you still cling to your benighted views and your “ ancient texts , ” you are living in the past and your views merit no respect .\nBruni ’ s solution to the impasse is not some sort of goodwill compromise or a treaty of mutual respect , but a take-no-prisoners ultimatum to Christians to abandon their beliefs or else . When Bruni says that Christians ’ understanding of sexual morality is “ a choice , ” what he means is that there is a way out without completely losing face : just embrace the new morality preached by mainstream liberal churches that see nothing wrong with any sexual arrangement you are comfortable with . Then we will accept you .\nAs a food critic , NY Times writer Frank Bruni was entertaining and occasionally informative . As an op-ed columnist he is adolescent and often repetitive . But as a theologian , he is simply abysmal .\nBruni takes it upon himself to explain how the Bible can be interpreted to read that God is really fine with sodomy and that all that antiquated stuff against adultery , fornication , and “ men lying with other men ” is a quaint vestige of an archaic worldview that went out definitively with Freud .\nThe scary part about Bruni ’ s essay is not his awkward attempt at playing the biblical scholar , but the undertone of evident disdain for Christians and his proposal that those who resist should be forcibly reeducated .\nIn Christians ’ refusal to bend with the times , Bruni sees not faithfulness to God but willful obstinacy that must be broken .\n“ So our debate about religious freedom should include a conversation about freeing religions and religious people from prejudices that they needn ’ t cling to and can indeed jettison , much as they ’ ve jettisoned other aspects of their faith ’ s history , rightly bowing to the enlightenments of modernity , ” Bruni writes .\nBut what if Christians don ’ t want to change ? What if they don ’ t want to “ bow to the enlightenments of modernity ” ? What if they are convinced that the modern worldview is not necessarily the most enlightened path when it comes to the ultimate meaning of life and death , time and eternity ?\n“ Religion , ” writes Bruni , “ is going to be the final holdout and most stubborn refuge for homophobia . It will give license to discrimination . ”\nBruni cites fellow gay activist Mitchell Gold , founder of the advocacy group Faith in America , as saying that church leaders must be made to take homosexuality off the sin list . “ His commandment is worthy — and warranted , ” writes Bruni .\nSo now government should be dictating belief to churches and enforcing theological orthodoxy ? Now politicians and courts will be telling Christians what they are allowed to consider as sinful ? Isn ’ t this what America was founded to escape from ?\nPeople are already talking about forcing churches to perform same-sex weddings , whether they like it or not , or get out of the marriage business . Christians founded America and yet now the minority gay lobby is trying to tell them they are personae non gratae and their beliefs are no longer welcome .\nAmerica has a grand tradition of tolerance and religious freedom , respect for a diversity of beliefs , and an honest engagement with ideas of all sorts . It seems that some would like to force all Americans to walk in lockstep , marching to the same drummer .\nSincere Christians have no problem accepting other people with all their sins , inclinations , and struggles , fully understanding that they are in no way superior to the next guy and no better in God ’ s eyes .\nBut attempts to force them to abandon their ethical standards and their principles reveal not open-mindedness or fairness , but intolerance , chauvinism , and hate .\nThese are the attitudes that have no place in America . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "475": "The most surprising aspect of the furor surrounding the infamous unsigned New York Times Op-Ed , ostensibly written by a member of the Trump administration , is that anyone believes its author is a senior official . Assuming this person isn ’ t an employee of the Times , and it is by no means unknown for the Gray Lady ’ s journalists to fabricate quotes and attribute them to anonymous “ officials , ” the author of this hit piece is at most a mid-level staffer . Indeed , if this character is actually employed in the Trump administration , it is almost certainly at a level of insignificance verging on invisibility .\nHow is it possible to be so sure ? First , the editors of the Times are virulently anti-Trump . Their assurances about the prominence of this furtive functionary simply can ’ t be trusted . Moreover , as Phelim McAleer at Townhall points out , the nation ’ s “ newspaper of record ” has a long history of exaggerating the seniority of officials it quotes anonymously . He highlights a lengthy anti-fracking article that purported to quote “ senior ” oil industry insiders and federal analysts describing the extraction process as a colossal scam . It was eventually discovered that all the quotes had in reality come from an intern .\nNot coincidentally , the solipsistic voice and callow perspective that “ Anonymous ” brings to the Op-Ed tends to undermine the claim that it was written by a high-ranking official in any administration . Most senior members of the Trump administration are over 50 years old and many are well beyond 60 . Yet , throughout the entire essay , there is an unmistakable thread of historical illiteracy and presentism that one would normally associate with a Millennial . This is evident in its very first sentence : “ President Trump is facing a test to his presidency unlike any faced by a modern American leader. ” Really ?\nThis means one of two things : Either “ Anonymous ” believes that the modern era began a couple of decades ago or that the Cold War , the Cuban Missile Crisis , the Vietnam War , the Watergate scandal , the OPEC Embargo , the Iran Hostage Crisis , the fall of the Soviet Union , the Clinton impeachment , the 9-11 attacks , and the Iraq War were all relatively minor events for the relevant presidential administrations . It strains credulity to the limit to suggest that a senior official of the Trump administration would compose the hopelessly naïve sentence quoted above and permit it to be published in the New York Times .\nThe opening sentence isn ’ t the only indication that the author of the Op-Ed is a junior time server languishing in the bowels of the Eisenhower Office building . The piece consists primarily of shopworn clichés that can be heard in any bar in any college town in America ( or on CNN if you ’ re stuck in an airport ) . This self-styled “ defender of our democratic institutions ” solemnly states that “ President Trump ’ s impulses are generally anti-trade and anti-democratic , ” that he “ shows a preference for autocrats and dictators , ” that “ the country is bitterly divided , ” and that the “ root of the problem is the president ’ s amorality . ”\nNone of this is original . Nor is it accurate . But it does contain a revealing cliché that serves as an indicator of the author ’ s lack of seniority — the tired trope concerning how Trump has bitterly divided the country . It ’ s only possible to believe this nonsense if you are too young to remember the deep divisions in public opinion over Vietnam , the Nuclear Freeze movement , the Clinton impeachment , and Iraq . It is not merely inaccurate to blame Trump for today ’ s political divisions , it ’ s also naïve to believe that polarization is always bad . As David W. Brady and Hahrie Han wrote in the Washington Post in 2014 :\nAlthough many contemporary political observers decry polarization and yearn for an era of bipartisanship , the opposite was true in the immediate post-war era . During that time , which was the most bipartisan era of our nation ’ s history , political observers wrung their hands over the inability of parties to present clear alternatives to voters.… The grass is always greener .\nThis wouldn ’ t be news to a “ senior ” official . Nor would it be surprising that a relatively new presidential administration can be pretty chaotic . But the youthful hubris of our anonymous genius is such that it obscures the reality that Trump ’ s successes were actually accomplished by the President and his loyal aides : “ There are bright spots.… But these successes have come despite — not because of — the president ’ s leadership style. ” In other words , “ Anonymous ” has saved the nation from Trump ’ s “ misguided impulses. ” Mark Penn , a veteran of the Clinton administration , puts such delusions into perspective :\nAides have felt they know better than their leaders since Joseph and the Pharaoh.… Arriving from Arkansas , the Clintons were as alien to Washington as the Trumps . They faced many of the same problems of runaway staff , investigations , and chaos in the White House . Instead of CNN and MSNBC , they soon would battle a Fox News channel that aimed to set their hair on fire daily .\nPresident Trump has , however , been far more effective during his first 19 months in office than Clinton was during two terms . In fact , most of the accomplishments for which the latter now takes credit — including welfare reform — were forced on him by a GOP-controlled Congress . Trump has cut taxes for 80 percent of the public , presided over an economic boom , lowered unemployment , freed millions from the clutches of Obamacare , killed countless federal regulations , begun rebuilding the nation ’ s military , kick-started the energy sector , destroyed ISIS , withdrawn from the Paris Climate scam , etc .\nAll of this and much more has been accomplished by President Trump while “ Anonymous ” works with other low level drones “ to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations. ” So , what do we know about the unnamed author of the New York Times hit piece ? If this person is a member of the Trump administration , the taxpayers are footing the bill for the deliberate obstruction of their will as expressed in the 2016 presidential election . The good news is that the sophomoric opinions expressed in the anonymous Times Op-Ed are probably nothing more than the impotent puling of a powerless cubicle critter . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "476": "Whenever we libertarians point out democracy 's perverse incentives ( as I do here ) we risk being accused of elitism . However , those who assume that the only alternative to rule by the people is rule by an aristocracy reveal a tragically incomplete awareness of the choices before us .\nRather than choose among rulers , we should ask why anyone at all must rule . But even if we do n't go quite that far , we could entertain the idea that radically reducing the scale and scope of government , which essentially is the threat of violence , would also drastically reduce the harm produced by those perverse incentives . Elitism is n't the only available alternative to democracy—and it certainly is not the most desirable one .\nUnfortunately , some libertarian critiques of democracy encourage nonlibertarians to believe some form of elitism is the only alternative . Take Georgetown University professor Jason Brennan 's recent op-ed , `` Can epistocracy , or knowledge-based voting , fix democracy ? '' in the Los Angeles Times , which is drawn from his book Against Democracy . Brennan begins by citing democracy 's systemic flaw : `` The median voter wields great power over what politicians ultimately do . But—and here 's the problem—the median voter would fail economics or Political Science 101 . ''\n`` For 60 years , political scientists have studied what voters actually know , '' Brennan continues .\nThe results are depressing . Hundreds of different surveys , such as the American National Election Studies , find that the median voter is ignorant or misinformed not only about the social sciences needed to evaluate candidates ' policy proposals , but even of basic facts and trends , such as what the unemployment rate is and whether it 's going up or down . This is n't because public schools fail us . It 's not because Fox News or MSNBC ( take your pick ) bamboozles poor voters with well-crafted lies . It 's not because people are inherently stupid or unable to think for themselves . It 's because democracy gives us the wrong incentives . How we vote matters , but how any one of us votes does not . The chance an individual vote will make a difference is vanishingly small . Thus , we have little incentive to gather relevant information so that we can cast our votes in careful , thoughtful ways… . While not everything governments do is decided by voters — bureaucracies , parties and officials have significant independence — what voters want makes a difference . And since voters are generally uninformed , we get worse policies that we would with a better-informed electorate .\nI 'll leave for another time Brennan 's debatable contention that this `` better-informed electorate '' is really better informed where it counts . ( When this electorate says it favors `` free trade , '' does it actually mean neoliberal managed trade through government agreements , which may be what some of the supposedly lesser informed electorate fears ? ) Instead , I 'll focus on Brennan 's `` alternative to democracy called epistocracy . '' He explains : `` In a democracy , every citizen gets an equal right to vote . In an epistocracy , voting power is widespread , but votes are weighted : More knowledgeable citizens ' votes count more . ''\nBrennan lays out several ways to implement epistocracy , insisting that `` epistocracies should keep some things—like our basic rights—off the bargaining table . They should make power widespread because concentrating power among the few invites abuse . Epistocracies should have constitutional limits on power , judicial review , checks and balances and a bill of rights—just like representative democracies . '' That 's a relief , but can we really trust the informed elite to understand basic rights ? ( Did the framers of the Constitution get it right ? I argue otherwise in America 's Counter-Revolution : The Constitution Revisited . )\nEven with his caveat , Brennan 's proposal leaves him open to the charge of elitism . Rod Dreher of The American Conservative writes :\nRestricting the vote to the cognitive elite is no solution . I would rather be ruled by the first thousand people through the gates at the Daytona 500 than the people in that room Friday night with Hillary Clinton and Barbra Streisand . Guess who holds more power already in our society ? That 's right : the cognitive elite . That 's how it works in a meritocracy . Prof. Brennan 's epistocracy would only give them more — for our own good .\nBrennan certainly does not blunt the elitism charge when he writes :\nSome would object that epistocracy is essentially inegalitarian . In an epistocracy , not everyone has the same voting power . But what 's so wrong with that ? Only some people have plumbing or hairdressing licenses because we accept that only some people are qualified to fix pipes or cut hair . Perhaps only some people , rather than everyone 18 and over , are truly qualified to decide who will lead the most powerful country on earth .\nNeed I point out that it is astonishing for a libertarian to cite licensing in defense of his plan for an unequal distribution of voting power ? Formally , licensing is the state 's way of determining who may and may not engage in occupations supposedly in the interest of consumers . Actually , licensing is how incumbent practitioners of occupations exclude competition and hamper innovation in order to support the monopolistic incomes to which they have become accustomed . It 's a system of privilege . Why hitch political reform to it ?\nThe public-choice problems with any form of epistocracy have long been noted , and Brennan is familiar with them . For example , who would compose the test to determine who gets extra votes ? Even if we assume that Brennan has good ideas about making any test fair , public-choice analysis gives us ███ to doubt that his ideas would be adopted .\nAnother problem with testing relates to Gilbert Ryle 's distinction between `` knowing how '' and `` knowing that . '' Someone could be ignorant of the facts asked for on a test—what 's the unemployment rate ? what party controls Congress ? Etc.—but have perfectly libertarian instincts about what the government ought not to be able to do to him . Why should that person have fewer votes than , say , Paul Krugman or George Will ?\nThe shame here is the Brennan need n't have gone down this road . He needed only to spell out the flaws in democracy , contrast stupid `` public '' action with reasonably intelligent private action , and call for a substantial shrinking of government—if not its abolition . Why invite the elitist charge with a call for an epistocracy ?\nAlbert Jay Nock had it right in the opening of his classic book , Our Enemy the State :\nIf we look beneath the surface of our public affairs , we can discern one fundamental fact , namely , a great redistribution of power between society and the State . This is the fact that interests the student of civilization . He has only a secondary or derived interest in matters like price fixing , wage fixing , inflation , political banking , 'agricultural adjustment , ' and similar items of State policy that fill the pages of newspapers and the mouths of publicists and politicians . All these can be run up under one head . They have an immediate and temporary importance , and for this ███ they monopolize public attention , but they all come to the same thing ; which is , an increase of State power and a corresponding decrease of social power . It is unfortunately none too well understood that , just as the State has no money of its own , so it has no power of its own . All the power it has is what society gives it , plus what it confiscates from time to time on one pretext or another ; there is no other source from which State power can be drawn . Therefore every assumption of State power , whether by gift or seizure , leaves society with so much less power . There is never , nor can there be , any strengthening of State power without a corresponding and roughly equivalent depletion of social power .\nSocial power is Nock 's term for the web of peaceful consensual relations—market and otherwise—among free individuals . Thus the people 's best political framework is neither democracy nor epistocracy but original liberalism , or what we today call libertarianism . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

The special was taped before California 's COVID-19 pandemic lockdown .\nCBS previously aired two `` The Price Is Right at Night '' specials last December which proved to be ratings winners for the network , according to Deadline .\nThe popular game show has been aired by CBS since Sept. 4 , 1972 . It 's the longest-running series in network television history . Bob Barker hosted the show for 35 years . Carey stepped in to host when Barker retired in 2007 .\nLifeNews.com reported RuPaul has been an abortion activist for years .\nIn 2017 , he told Marie Claire magazine that his mother used to work at Planned Parenthood , the largest abortion group in America . He organized a fundraiser for the abortion chain that year , too .\n`` Women in our culture have been so marginalized and so really beaten down , '' he told the magazine . `` We live in a masculine-dominated culture .

    "478": "According to various reports , Megyn Kelly has not only “ parted ways ” with NBC after losing her coveted 9 a.m. hour on NBC ’ s Today Show , she lost her representation at the powerful CAA talent agency .\nWorse , when she tried to move to UTA , her “ blackface ” comments closed that door .\nBecause she is now toxic , on Wednesday , Kelly could only hire an attorney to represent her , a move that points to her fighting for every penny left on her three-year , $ 69 million contract — an agreement that was not set to expire with NBC until 2020 .\nAfter 12 years as a superstar at Fox News and a disastrous , calamitous , dumpster fire two ( give or take ) years at NBC , Kelly is about to go kicking and screaming as she exits stage left , but exit stage left she will because she has no place left to go… Which I think was always NBC ’ s plan…\nLuring Megyn Kelly to NBC was never about anything other than destroying Megyn Kelly .\nWhat NBC News did to Kelly has happened before . With the lure of a dream job attached to a hook that fulfills a rival ’ s hubris , the rival is humiliated and forever destroyed . It ’ s an old trick and Kelly and her ego fell for it .\nIn 1979 , the New Yorker ’ s Pauline Kael was the most influential film critic in America . With this power , she made Warren Beatty her pet cause throughout the 1970s — and then she turned on him , attacking Beatty and his 1978 hit Heaven Can Wait ( which he co-wrote and directed ) as a sellout , a trifle , a betrayal .\nMany believe Beatty got his revenge by offering Kael her dream job , the opportunity to work with him on his next film . As quickly as that came together , though , it flamed out . Within a year Kael had very publicly failed in Hollywood and was forced to crawl back to the New Yorker . Only now , she looked foolish and weak , and would never again wield the same power .\nThroughout the late ’ 80s and early ’ 90s , Michael Ovitz was not only the most powerful agent in Hollywood , he was the town ’ s undisputed King — a powerbroker ’ s powerbroker and the scourge of the studios as he shifted industry power to his clients — to actors and directors . Then Disney chairman Michael Eisner offered Ovitz his dream job , the opportunity to run a studio . Promised he was being groomed to eventually replace Eisner , Ovitz bit .\nSixteen months later Eisner fired him , and that was the end of Michael Ovitz .\nOver at Fox News , Megyn Kelly was not only a ratings powerhouse and superstar , her smarts , preparation , and fearlessness made her an icon — especially to women , who saw in her someone they could relate to . Suddenly , the image of a powerful woman did not need to include the left ’ s noxious politics and man-hating .\nLike most larger-than-life figures , though , Kelly has a fatal flaw , and like Kael and Ovitz , it is hubris . Being one of the most popular and powerful anchors in the “ ghetto ” of cable news was no longer enough . She wanted it all . She wanted to be accepted and loved by the establishment media . So , through Machiavellian means , starting with the public betrayal of her Fox fans , she let the establishment media know she was ready to become one of them .\nHer plan was to single-handedly take down Donald Trump . This was her way of sending a message , her way of letting potential suitors know she was ready to sell out , to join the Borg collective , and to enjoy all the rewards that come to sellouts ( see : SE Cupp , Joe Scarborough , Matthew Dowd , Nicolle Wallace , etc… ) .\nAs she betrayed her Fox fans with her shrill and narcissistic attacks on Trump , Kelly readied the second part of her plan , a memoir titled Settle for More . The promotional tour was perfectly timed — it would begin just days after Trump lost the presidential election .\nThe book tour was supposed to be Kelly ’ s triumph , her victory parade where all the Beautiful People would not only credit her for defeating the villainous Trump , but exalt her as noble and brave for doing so by stabbing her own fans in the back . But then…\nTrump won the presidency , and instead of looking like a champion , Kelly looked exposed — ridiculous , caught off guard , and foolish .\nBy this time , NBC News had already lured her into their trap .\nBy design , by deliberately setting her up for failure , Kelly was doomed from day one at NBC — and it didn ’ t even cost a lot of money . For a mere $ 69 million , a pittance to NBC , the establishment media was able to take out a business and cultural rival in a little over a year .\nTo begin with , NBC intentionally ignored Kelly ’ s strengths , which shine in a live and combative format . First they handed her a 60 Minutes-type program , something she had never done before , and then they slotted Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly directly up against 60 Minutes , which has been a ratings juggernaut for 40 years . Then NBC allowed Kelly to air an interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin that made no news . Then they allowed Kelly to interview Alex Jones . Then they allowed her to crash and burn in this format , a format she had no business being a part of , and take 100 % of the blame for that failure .\nNBC then led Kelly even deeper into alien territory — a gooey morning show geared towards puffery and celebrity interviews .\nAs designed , Megyn Kelly Today was a disaster from day one . Kelly again looked ridiculous , out of her element and depth . Her mishaps were legion , and they were never forgiven because the establishment would never forgive her for her time at Fox News . Rather than circle the wagons , as they always do to protect one of their own , they just pointed and laughed and piled on .\nKelly was flailing , drowning , and no one was coming to her rescue . Then she went under…\nDuring the Tuesday edition of Megyn Kelly Today , Kelly and her guests were discussing a white woman on The Real Housewives of New York who dressed up like Diana Ross and went so far as to darken her skin with makeup .\n“ But what is racist ? ” Kelly asked . “ Because truly , you do get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on blackface on Halloween , or a black person who puts on whiteface for Halloween . Like , back when I was a kid , that was okay , as long as you were dressing up as , like , a character . ”\nWith these comments on Monday , Kelly handed NBC the murder weapon they had been waiting for . The entire network turned on her ( even the weatherman ) , and now she is all alone .\nMegyn Kelly made two massive mistakes . The first , and this is to her credit , is that unlike her fellow sellouts — the repulsive Scarborough and Cupp , etc . — she refused to completely sell out ; she did not offer the establishment her complete soul — only 99 percent of it , when they demand it all .\nBy the time she did offer up that remaining one percent — with Wednesday ’ s Orwellian grovel of an apology for her Halloween WrongThink — it was too late .\nThe second mistake Kelly made , and this is probably why she is about to become a footnote , is that in her quest for establishment media acceptance , she betrayed her base of support , and now she has no one to defend her , no audience to return to .\nKelly bet it all , and by doing so sold out her own fans , which left her with no one to come to her defense as NBC outmaneuvered , outsmarted , and circled for the kill — which had been NBC ’ s plan from the beginning .\nTo attract NBC News , Kelly mercilessly wielded virtue signaling against Trump as she shamelessly peacocked her own image by smearing him as a sexist , a pig , a hater of women .\nAnd now she will limp out of NBC News a victim of bullying virtue signalers smearing her as racist .\nEither way , Megyn Kelly is about to limp into a world she created — a world where both right and left have found a reason to unite as they delight in her comeuppance .\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @ NolteNC .

    "479": "So as America heads into the Thanksgiving holidays , the Washington and political/media Establishment still agog at the election of Donald Trump as the nation ’ s 45th president , various knickers are in knots because of news reports that the President-elect is considering making his son-in-law Jared Kushner a member of the White House staff .\nAghast , there are cries of nepotism with reference to a 1967 law that was belatedly targeted at President John F. Kennedy ’ s appointment of brother Bobby as Attorney General . The legislation might be called LBJ ’ s revenge as Lyndon Johnson hated Bobby Kennedy and this was , in the way of the famously vengeful LBJ , a way of getting even with the Kennedys , although by 1967 RFK was comfortably ensconced in the U.S. Senate representing New York .\nBut well aside from a considerable body of opinion that the 1967 law doesn ’ t apply to the White House staff , there is simple ignorance of the fact that various presidents did in fact formally rely on family members to advise them on the problems of the day . The addition of Jared Kushner to the senior White House staff would not only be important — it has lots and lots of precedence .\nThe tradition of presidents relying on family members as presidential confidantes began with the beginning of the United States itself . Then-Vice President John Adams saw to it that President George Washington appointed Adams ’ s son , John Quincy Adams , as the American Minister to the Netherlands . John Quincy had long been a key confidante of his father , accompanying him on diplomatic missions when the senior Adams was the American envoy to France and the Netherlands . When John Adams was elected the nation ’ s second president he promptly appointed his son the U.S . Ambassador to Prussia , where he served until his father ’ s defeat by Thomas Jefferson in 1800 .\nPresident James Madison had no children of his own but , in an effort to help his troubled adopted son of wife Dolley , saw to it that John Payne Todd was appointed as a secretary to an official U.S. delegation in Europe .\nAndrew Jackson Donelson , the namesake nephew of President Andrew Jackson , was so well-thought of by Jackson as an advisor that Jackson appointed him as his private secretary in the White House , a post the influential Donelson held for all eight years of his presidency .\nTwo of Martin Van Buren ’ s sons , Martin Jr. and Smith , served their father in the White House when Van Buren was elected to succeed Jackson in 1836 . Martin Jr. served as private secretary to his presidential father , while his brother Smith was a special assistant .\nSarah Childress Polk , the wife of President James K. Polk , had no children . But it was she — the sitting First Lady — who helped write presidential speeches and was his confidante on policy .\nPresident Lincoln made sure to get son Robert appointed to the staff of General Ulysses Grant , a position that the younger Lincoln had at Appomattox and that propelled him on to a highly successful career of his own in both the law and politics , later serving as Secretary of War for Presidents Garfield and Arthur .\nEdith Bolling Galt plays a startling role in American history . The second wife of Woodrow Wilson , when her husband suffered a stroke midway through his second term it was wife Ellen — not Vice President Thomas Marshall — who made the decisions of what briefings the bedridden president would and would not get . In effect , she was the acting president .\nPresident Franklin Roosevelt insisted that sons Franklin Jr. and Elliot attend the famous Argentina conference — the “ Atlantic Charter ” meeting — with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in August of 1941 . It was at this conference , his two sons in attendance at FDR ’ s personal insistence , that Roosevelt and Churchill and their advisers hammered out the goals and objectives of the Allies in World War II and the postwar world they would shape afterwards .\nOne could go on here . There are also presidential aides who , while not family members were viewed as family members because of their closeness to the president . Wilson ’ s press secretary Joseph Tumulty and longtime friend Colonel Edward House played this role . As did FDR advisers Louis Howe and Harry Hopkins , both of whom lived in the White House with the President and First Lady .\nIn the Kennedy era there was not just brother Bobby running the Justice Department , there was the so-called “ Irish mafia ” of close JFK pals all of whom had official positions in the White House . Kenneth O ’ Donnell effectively served as White House chief of staff , Lawrence O ’ Brien was the White House congressional liaison , and Dave Powers was the all-around presidential companion . And , of course , there was not only brother Bobby at the Justice Department but brother-in-law Sargent Shriver running the Peace Corps .\nFamously , in the Reagan era , it was Reagan ’ s close relationship with Michael Deaver almost as a son that had the Californian installed as the White House Deputy Chief of Staff in a “ troika ” that included the Washington insider James Baker as chief of staff , the conservative strategist and longtime Reaganite Ed Meese as a counselor/strategist , with Deaver having the personal relationship to both Ronald and Nancy Reagan . No accident either was it that daughter Maureen Reagan served as co-chair of the Republican National Committee during a period of her father ’ s presidency . Not too put too fine a point on it , perhaps the most influential person in the Reagan White House after the President was Nancy Reagan herself .\nAnd , of course , there was Hillary Clinton in the Bill Clinton-era running the president ’ s health care initiative . Not to mention longtime George W. Bush and Bush family friend Karl Rove in the Bush 43 era .\nIn other words ? All this angst over the potential presence of President-elect Donald Trump ’ s son-in-law Jared Kushner in the Trump White House is so much baloney . Literally from the beginnings of the presidency one president after another has turned to a family member or sometimes multiples of family members as official or unofficial confidantes in their White House . Sometimes with portfolio , sometimes not — but always with influence and power in the White House . And on occasion they saw to it that this or that child was appointed to a favored diplomatic or military position , as both John Adams and Abraham Lincoln did with sons John Quincy and Robert — effectively launching their sons on careers of their own .\nIf he decides to take a job on the White House staff , Jared Kushner is superbly qualified as a successful businessman ( and publisher ) all by himself in his own right . His addition to the Trump White House senior staff would be uniquely important . But as a family member who has the personal confidence of the new president Mr. Kushner would be but the latest example of a presidential family member placed in a position of power and responsibility .

    "481": "President Donald Trump promised to help allies following attacks on major Saudi Arabian oil facilities , even though he said the U.S. no longer needs energy from the Middle East and has few tankers there .\n`` We are a net Energy Exporter , '' Trump tweeted Monday morning . `` We do n't need Middle Eastern Oil & Gas , & in fact have very few tankers there , but will help our Allies ! ''\nBrent oil posted its biggest ever intraday jump Monday to more than $ 71 a barrel . It pared some gains , though both Brent and West Texas crude were still trading about 10 % higher as news of the devastating attack on the world 's largest exporter also sent currencies of commodity-linked nations higher .\nTrump 's statement Monday followed his weekend vow that the U.S. is `` locked and loaded depending on verification '' that Iran staged the attack on major Saudi Arabian oil facilities , an assertion already made by his secretary of state and backed by administration officials .\n`` There is reason to believe that we know the culprit , are locked and loaded depending on verification , '' Trump said on Twitter on Sunday without mentioning Iran or specifying what the response would entail . He said he 's awaiting word from Saudi Arabia about who it believed caused the attack and `` under what terms we would proceed ! ''\nSeveral administration officials said Sunday that they had substantial evidence that Iran was behind the attack , not the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen who claimed responsibility . On Saturday , Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said unequivocally in a tweet that Iran was to blame .\nTwo administration officials who asked not to be identified discussing internal deliberations told reporters that cruise missiles may have been used in the attacks on a Saudi oil field and the world 's biggest crude-processing facility in Abqaiq . The range from Yemen was also far beyond the distance of anything the Houthis have ever done , the officials said .\nA third administration official , who also asked not to be identified discussing non-public findings , said precision-guided munitions had been used . The U.S. officials did n't rule out that armed drones were used as well , even as they rejected the Houthi claims that they mounted the attacks using such pilotless aircraft .\nNow , the challenge that the Trump administration faces is balancing a tough response to what it says is a clear act of of Iranian aggression , against concern that it 's rushing headlong into a conflict that could spiral out of control . Analysts also warn that doing nothing could send a message to Iran or its proxy militias across the Middle East that they can strike their enemies with impunity .\n`` There 's no great response here , '' said Aaron David Miller , senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace . `` The question becomes how does the U.S. navigate between not allowing this precedent to stand on one hand , and avoiding a punitive escalation or one designed to deter future attacks without an escalation . And the answer is there is no answer . ''\nStill , a major U.S. military response may be unlikely , according to experts who said they doubt Trump will be willing to use force against Tehran or risk escalating violence in the Middle East ahead of the 2020 presidential election . In June , Trump said he considered a military strike on Iran for shooting down a U.S. drone , only to call off the action at the last minute .\nAnalysts also said the attacks may do little to deter the president from seeking a meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in an effort to broker a new nuclear agreement .\nTrump has n't ruled out a possible meeting with Rouhani when both are in New York in a week for the annual United Nations General Assembly . He tweeted on Sunday that the `` Fake News is saying that I am willing to meet with Iran , ‘ No Conditions ' That is an incorrect statement ( as usual ! ) . '' But officials including Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have told reporters publicly that Trump is willing to take a meeting with no conditions .\nThe administration 's `` maximum pressure '' stance against Iran is focused on imposing sanctions and isolating the country over its nuclear ambitions and malign activities in the region . That approach has come under renewed scrutiny at a time the president 's foreign policy team is in flux , after Trump 's firing of hawkish National Security Adviser John Bolton last week .\nU.S. and Saudi officials say they 're gathering more evidence that Iran was behind the attacks — some of it on the ground in Saudi Arabia — that will be released in due time . Iran 's Foreign Ministry described Pompeo 's comments blaming the Islamic Republic as `` blind and fruitless accusations . ''\nAccording to U.S. government information , there were 19 points of attack at state-owned Saudi Aramco 's crude-processing facility at Abqaiq and the Khurais oil field , all on the north or northwest-facing sides — suggesting that the weaponry used came from that direction . Iraq lies to the north , and the U.S. in the past has accused Iran of stashing explosives with affiliated militias in the country . Yemen , by contrast , is hundreds of miles to the south .\nSaudi Aramco lost roughly 5.7 million barrels per day of output after the attacks , although officials cited progress in restoring production .\nPompeo tweeted Saturday that there is `` no evidence the attacks came from Yemen '' and accused Iran of being behind `` an unprecedented attack on the world 's energy supply . ''\n`` The United States will work with our partners and allies to ensure that energy markets remain well supplied and Iran is held accountable for its aggression , '' he added .\nPaul Pillar , a former U.S. Central Intelligence Agency officer , said the one `` policy option left is de-escalation — of the Saudi air war against Yemen , and of the Trump administration 's economic war against Iran . ''\nPillar , who 's now a non-resident senior fellow at Georgetown University in Washington , said `` further attempts to escalate on either of those war fronts offers no reason to believe that they would be any more successful than the wars have been up to this point . ''\nTrump would risk criticism from many of his Republican allies if he chose to meet with Iran 's leader barely a week after accusing the country of being responsible for a strike that caused a significant disruption to the world 's oil markets . Republican Senator Lindsay Graham of South Carolina has said the U.S. should n't rule out a military strike on Iranian oil facilities in response .\n`` Iran will not stop their misbehavior until the consequences become more real , like attacking their refineries , which will break the regime 's back , '' Graham tweeted Saturday .\nOne Western diplomat , who asked not to be identified , said Trump sees what he wants to see in world events , so if he wanted to meet with Iran 's president , the strikes would n't necessarily deter him . Trump has repeatedly brushed aside short-range missile tests by North Korea as he seeks to broker a historic nuclear pact with leader Kim Jong Un .\nWhite House Counselor Kellyanne Conway said on `` Fox News Sunday '' that the administration will continue its `` maximum pressure campaign , '' but she added that `` the president will always consider his options , '' including a meeting with Rouhani . That was hours before Trump seemed to rule out a meeting unless the Iranian president met unspecified conditions .\nNor is it clear the Iranian leader would be willing to take such a meeting — even an informal chat on the sidelines of the UN gathering — without the U.S. making some gesture to ease its sanctions on his country . The strikes in Saudi Arabia may all but rule out such a move anytime soon despite pleas by Western leaders led by French President Emmanuel Macron .\nThe attacks on Saudi Arabia also pose a major test for Pompeo , who has an opportunity to consolidate power after Bolton 's departure .\nPompeo and Brian Hook , the State Department 's special representative for Iran , have argued the U.S. could afford to ramp up sanctions and diplomatic pressure on Iran because there 's plenty of global oil supply . But there 's now little cushion in the market with the major disruption caused by the drone attacks , which could force the president and his team to look for ways to relieve the pressure .\nWhile analysts estimate Saudi Arabia may be able to restore half of the lost production as early as Monday , Trump said on Twitter Sunday that he 's authorized the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve if needed based on the attacks `` in a to-be-determined amount sufficient to keep the markets well-supplied . '' The stock of about 645 million barrels of crude and petroleum products could help meet demand during the time it would take for the Saudis to repair the facilities . Trump also told U.S. agencies to expedite approvals of oil pipelines in the permitting process .\nThere 's also the question of the administration 's credibility . Some foreign policy analysts said it 's hard to take at face value the claim that Tehran is responsible , given the hard line against Iran advocated by Pompeo , Bolton and others .\n`` The Trump administration appears to have evidence of Iranian responsibility but will face skepticism from others , both because of policy disagreements between the US and its allies , and because declining to attribute an attack provides an excuse not to respond , '' tweeted Michael Singh , managing director for the Washington Institute for Near East Policy . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "482": "I have returned ! From Europe that is , and I hope I met with no Russian undercover agents while there . The soi-disant Liberals are in a snit about the Russians . Apparently , Donald Trump Jr. and the mysterious Jared Kushner met with an undercover agent of the Kremlin in June of last year , and they did not report their meeting to The Powers That Be . Who are The Powers That Be ? Actually , I have no idea , but Trump and Kushner should have reported their exchange , which had something to do with adoption or adaption or possibly Hillary ’ s unwashed socks . You figure it out .\nThe stalwarts of American left ( we no longer call them Liberals — it is inappropriate ) are in another of their tense moments with the Trumps , and , of course , it has something to do with the Trumps and the Russians . The left has developed an irrational fear of the Russians , about whom they are positively obsessive . I am not sure why this is . Perhaps it is because today the Russians are no longer communists , and the erstwhile Liberals had long admired certain aspects of the communist system . As I recall , they admired the Marxist-Leninist tax code , and its attendant slow-growth economy . Remember their great economists such as John Kenneth Galbraith and Lester Thurow , oohing and aahing over how prosperous Russia was in the 1980s , just before the crash of communism ?\nHow did that crash come about , comrades ? Was it caused by something Ronald Reagan did ? Reagan was the Donald Trump of his era . Are our friends to the left still perplexed as to how a grade B movie actor contributed to the fall of communism ? Now what can they be expecting from a billionaire businessman ?\nThe morbid preoccupations of the American left continue apace . Of course , there is their aforementioned paranoia over post-communist Russia . And there is the environment that is increasingly sickening them ; and the civil rights of public toilet users in certain red states ; and civil rights in general . The KKK is making a comeback and they are aided and abetted by the increasingly popular alt-right movement and the Sons and Daughters of the Confederacy who object the expurgation of five years of American history back in the 19th century . Then there is the Resistance Movement that has been a theme with the American left ever since Hillary Clinton had her meltdown on election night .\nAs David Gelernter pointed out last week in the Wall Street Journal , the American left has adopted “ resistance ” in response to Trump ’ s election in a free and democratic election . As Gelernter wrote : “ Democrats , in their role as opponents of President Trump , have taken to calling themselves ‘ the resistance. ’ ” They are co-opting the term “ resistance ” from the free French who in World War II were opposing , as Gelernter says , “ the Nazis in occupied France. ” In their delusions the members of the American left are modern-day Freedom Fighters and the Trumps are Nazis . Continuing the left ’ s fantasy , the American army and its allies will eventually be called in to liberate “ the resistance. ” And who will march down our Champs-Élysées , Hillary ?\nI saw my first member of the resistance at Brussels airport wearing his black tee shirt with “ Resistance ” boldly emblazoned across our hero ’ s chest . He was asleep . I did not want to awaken him with troubling news . His fly was halfway down . Since then I have seen black tee shirts everywhere in Washington bearing variations on the Resistance theme : “ The Resistance ; ” or simply “ Resist ; ” or , harkening back to Hillary , “ She Persists , You Resist. ” Nowhere is it reported that Donald Trump has taken any notice , to say nothing of ordering out his Brown Shirts .\nIs it possible that we shall endure such childishness into 2018 ? I believe it is . Comparing oneself to Freedom Fighters who faced torture and death while one lounges in the Brussels airport may seem like a leap into fantasy to normal Americans , but it is nothing to the American left . They have been inhabiting a fantasy world since the first Clinton Administration . Those were the years in which they beheld Bill Clinton as the Virgin President and Monica Lewinsky as The Stalker . Ever since then the left ’ s condition has worsened . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

    "484": "Any fair assessment of our President is that he is flawed as a person . His sense of self much exceeds the norm . Some of his insults famously transcend those we associate with the meme “ Politics Ain ’ t Beanbag. ” On discrete occasions , he has disappointed staunch supporters by punctuating certain powerfully valid viewpoints with “ facts ” that are so demonstrably wrong that they approach the coveted Gold Standard for Public Falsehood established by the dual-gender political tag-team of Clintons and exceeded only by Barack Obama . ( See also : “ Shovel-ready jobs ” ; “ If you like your [ ] , you can keep your [ ] ” ; “ More young black men languish in prison than attend colleges and universities across America ” ; Solyndra . ) President Trump infuriates his foes and leaves his supporters ofttimes squeamish .\nShall we rue his election , as “ Never Trumpers ” continue to do ? Well , first of all — He ’ s what we ’ ve got for the next 41 or 89 months . Had we gotten Hillary instead , we would not have encountered fewer lies from the Oval Office , nor from whatever new bathroom she would have selected to store her next-generation stealth computer server . In a world where Benghazi was caused by a YouTube video that almost no one saw — and which no one conceivably viewed through its painfully not-soon-enough conclusion — and in which a Secretary of State had exchanged tens of thousands of emails regarding her yoga classes and daughter ’ s wedding dress , one need not fantasize to grasp how much public lying would have emanated from a new Clinton West Wing , Oval Office , and from under the President ’ s desk had we been Hillaried .\nHillary would have assured the Obama Revolution a prospective permanence , endangering the future of the Republic without slowing the rise of the seas or healing the planet . Would Michelle Obama by now be the ninth Supreme Court Justice casting tie-breaking votes ? Or Barack ? Or a kindred soul ? If so , before we mourn an imperiled Second Amendment , what would have become of the First Amendment ? In a world in which the politically deranged and morally challenged Southern Poverty Law Center can defame the most decent of Christian religious-freedom advocates , groups like Alliance Defending Freedom , as “ Hate Groups , ” what would have been left of religious freedom under a Hillary ? And what of the embattled First Amendment right to speak one ’ s mind freely in an environment where there is no inducement to violence , no imminent lawless action , but a plethora of campus intolerance and university schemes aimed at taxing speech into silence by imposing exorbitant “ security fees ” and moving conservative groups and scholars to off-site inaccessible venues and to obscure dates when students are otherwise engaged ?\nOne is reminded of the O.J . book that never saw light of day : “ If I Did It. ” If she had done it and won , would she have been less combative and vindictive against her perceived foes than is President Trump ? Just to know her was to risk wrath ( Dick Morris ) , scorn ( Gennifer Flowers , Monica Lewinsky , Paula Jones , Kathleen Willey , Juanita Broaddrick ) , termination ( seven employees of the White House Travel Office ) , and imprisonment ( Susan McDougal ; Billy Dale , director of said travel office ) . If her new book is titled “ What Happened ” — a question frequently asked , upon regaining consciousness , by those who have been knocked out for a ten-count — the answer is : American dodged a political bullet and now has a chance to recover its soul . That is what happened .\nAnd , yet , how explain the raw and brusque President Trump-the-Divider when compared to a previous modern conservative President , Ronald Reagan-the-Unifier ? Reagan , too , was the media celebrity who defied the odds , won the election that the pollsters expected him to lose , thereafter was pilloried by the left media as a buffoon actor , a pretender , and incompetent who belonged more in bed with Bonzo than with the strange bedfellows of politics . So , now that Donald Trump has won and has been in the White House for seven months , why isn ’ t he more like Reagan ?\nAlas , the media never have given President Trump even the begrudging chance they gave President Reagan . Yes , Ronald Reagan entered the White House with a reputation as a tough governor , a man who had dispatched the California national guard to Berkeley to delay the premature emergence of Antifa for another half century . However , he also came in as a likable guy . The leftist news media could mock him and deride First Lady Nancy ’ s dresses and chinaware , but people had seen him in the movies and on TV . Reagan played the good guys , the cowboys with white hats , the doggone Gipper . His mere smile persuaded Americans to buy light bulbs by General Electric , Royal Crown cola , Van Heusen shirts , Westinghouse refrigerators , V-8 juice , and Chesterfields . He lay in bed with impish monkeys for silliness , playing an absent-minded psychology professor in an era when professors did not penalize students ’ grades and withhold letters of recommendation from students reading Ayn Rand , Bill Buckley , or Milton Friedman . Reagan was lovable . Even die-hard liberals who hated his tough politics still knew that , at bottom , Reagan was a sweet pussycat . He told wonderful stories , funny anecdotes , delivered great one-liners with punch . And he smiled self-effacingly .\nThat never stopped the vicious leftist media from hounding First Lady Nancy Reagan , as they later would do to Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin , over their outfits that actually cost a fraction of a Hillary Clinton pantsuit or jacket or a taxpayer-funded regal European designer couture creation commissioned by and for Michelle Obama . In the time before Fox News , Rush Limbaugh , and the internet , the media had no boundaries in hounding the President and mocking his elegant and graceful wife . But Americans liked Reagan , even more when contrasted from his immediate predecessor , the dour and sour tight-lipped Jimmy Carter , who by-the-way presided over a 14 percent inflation rate and 444 days of an Iranian hostage mess . And then a certified nut decided to impress Jodi Foster by shooting Reagan . The President ’ s personal courage and humor during the aftermath , while his life hung in the balance , sealed the deal . The Gipper took one for us .\nBy contrast for Donald Trump , although our nation ’ s Chief Executive likewise entered the Presidency as a TV star , his stardom was rooted in being the guy who terminates prospective employees — “ You ’ re fired. ” He has a likable side , especially if you go for the superficially tough brash New Yorker macho , but also a very dislikeable side if you don ’ t . He came in hated . He was hated because he regularly escalated the rhetoric stratospherically , having divined an Achilles ’ heel in the media that assured him unbridled access to billions of dollars ( billions with a “ b ” ) of free air time on the news channels and talk shows by speaking irrepressibly and with calculated irresponsibility . He was hated because he up-ended the Republican establishment ’ s carefully laid plans for yet another four-year sequel of Bush kinder gentler rigor mortis . Trump was brazen , unscripted , out of control . An embarrassment to the party . In time , he was running against both major political parties on the ballot : Hillary-Bernie Democrats and the “ Never Trump ” GOP elite .\nAs he became ever-predictably more unpredictable , gaining even more air time , a new sport ensued , aimed at misinterpreting his every word , his every intent . Perhaps the nadir of misstating his true meaning , the art of turning his words into something he never contemplated , came during the presidential campaign when he said that Hillary , in her prior race against Obama four years earlier , had been “ schlonged. ” Yes , that verb is the Yiddish word for the male reproductive organ . Immediately , the media shifted into overdrive , citing his using the term against a female candidate as proof of vile dark misogyny . But for those of us whose parents and neighbors actually spoke Yiddish , we who grew up in Brooklyn and Queens on the streets where Donald Trump grew up and learned life ’ s lingo , the term never was used colloquially to mean the physiological organ . Rather , it was used merely to convey that someone had gotten beaten really badly in a fair competition : “ The Mets get schlonged again yesterday , 14-3. ” “ Did you see Liston get schlonged in the first round ? ” Men clobbering men in a contest governed fairly by rules . No misogyny . That is how people tawk in Brooklyn and Queens .\nThat leftist media feeding-frenzy , mischaracterizing Trump ’ s vocabulary , reflected early-on the degree to which he would not get a break for the duration of his political career . The fabrication of intent was akin to a contemporary commentator bemoaning a politician ’ s bad political debate performance by saying “ He ( or she ) really sucked ” — and then having media parasites , reflecting their own coarseness of mind , imputing a sexual connotation to the verb . Before long , Trump had been labeled not only a misogynist and racist but even an anti-Semite , having issued a statement thoughtfully remembering the Holocaust — written by a Jewish staffer descended of Holocaust survivors — that failed to satisfy his critics among the wordsmiths of the left . As such , the circumstances underlying media acceptance of Trump ’ s ascent to the Presidency are not comparable to those encountered by Ronald Reagan but to those that greeted a different Republican whom the media despised , Richard Nixon . Like Nixon , Trump is the Republican who never had a chance with the left media , not from Day One — and not before Day One .\nNixon , who famously articulated that he knew full well that the media were devoted to kicking him around , handled the never-ending onslaught during his presidential years the “ professional ” way , the way that Trump critics now wish he would employ . When in the public eye , Nixon always acted “ presidential ” and spoke properly . He saved his cursing , his hatreds , and his vendettas for the clandestine arena of his ubiquitous recording devices and for the benefit of historians and scholars . However , as a public actor , Nixon delegated to Vice President Spiro Agnew the task to bark at the media as an attack dog , while Nixon postured above it all , parodying “ Sock it to me ! ” on NBC ’ s Laugh-In and greeting Elvis . Nevertheless , history teaches conclusively that determined aloofness from confronting the leftist media in direct fray never bought him succor , and ultimately the driven media took Nixon down , as they had set out to do from Day One .\nThat is Trump ’ s dilemma . From before he even set foot in the White House , the media have been intent on taking him down , Nixon-style , instead of parrying with him Reagan-style . The “ presidential ” way of dealing civilly with such a merciless and continuous onslaught failed Nixon ( exacerbated when his henchman , Agnew , was revealed to be a crook ) . It simply does not work to play nice when there are too many TV stations , too many hours of too many talking heads echoing each other ’ s verbal assaults on this President , too many websites and libelous bloggers , too many self-certified psychoanalysts dissecting a mind that is at least as functional as that of Maxine Waters . And , yes , too much darn fake news . ( Remember that first day , when Time magazine already was reporting falsely that he had removed a bust of the Rev . Dr. Martin Luther King from the Oval Office ? ) That is why poor Trump — in this context , truly poor Trump — finds himself caught in the first round of a never-ending eight-year boxing match , with a binary choice : either they take him down , or he takes them down . There is no in-between , no kibitzing with a funny tale of a fictional plumber setting an appointment ten years hence to repair a leak in a Communist Russia apartment . Rather , it is a battle to the political death , no holds barred — because the attackers are armed and , as though embarking on Vicksburg , are supplied amply for laying an eight-year siege .\nRonald Reagan , never the hyphenated American , nonetheless was blessed further with a fellow traveler sharing roots hailing to a common old sod . House Leader Tip O ’ Neill , his drinking buddy and erstwhile pal , would share laughs and warm moments at night with Reagan after a tough day of politics . Like an Oxford debate or a pre-season baseball game , it never was personal ; it simply was that thing we do . But Trump has no friends in D.C. with whom to muse . With uncanny certainty , everything he says , every muse , every “ what-if ? ” gets leaked , investigated , and consumes another 24-hour or week-long news cycle . Moreover , Nancy Pelosi and Charles Schumer , like the media whom they symbiotically feed and nourish , will not rest until they take him down and destroy him — unless he takes them down first . It is a post-Obama world , where eight years of Saul Alinsky ’ s “ rules for radicals ” have taken hold of the national culture , particularly in academia and in entertainment . A CNN-affiliated comedienne , albeit no longer CNN and never really comedic , holds a decapitated , bloodied head of the President of the United States . This is funny ? A late-night talk-show host rambles viciously about the President of the United States in terms not only disgusting and vile but also startlingly homophobic . He hosts an evening of humor sponsored by the news media ? A worn-out singer publicly wears a “ Vagina Hat ” on a rostrum ( and it is offensive to use the term “ schlonged ” ? ) and voices her wish that she could blow up the White House . A Shakespearean performance in the people ’ s park degrades into a metaphor for assassinating the President of the United States , a federal felony whose very suggestion is punishable by up to five years ’ incarceration . 18 U.S.C . § 871 .\nThis is the coarse and degraded post-Obama society that Donald Trump inherited . In great measure , his election conforms to the laws of Physics , comprising an equal and opposite force generated by eight immediately preceding years of an unparalleled coarsening of the American culture and abandoning of traditional American morality . This brave new world evidences new bold and daring on the left . They brazenly assemble frontally like terrorists , dressed in black and masks , armed with lethal weapons , battering and pummeling even peaceful , passive conservative demonstrators who publicly condemn racism and white supremacy , and who explicitly dissociate from the associated groups of hate . The First Amendment and free speech no longer are sacrosanct at the liberal university . Eight years of Obama changed America and empowered a new tyranny . The free exchange of ideas increasingly is the province only of those who talk to themselves .\nTrump assuredly is a divisive person , disturbingly thriving in the role . That is a shame . But the prior eight years saw that , first , John McCain and thereafter Mitt Romney were hopelessly unsuited to counter the new tyranny and repression of academia and the media left merely by advancing ideas and postulates with the grace and gentility of “ Reasonable Minds May Differ. ” The playing field is not structured evenly for the dignified conservative . At the earliest sign of a winning conservative idea , there now will be a Candy Crowley — less a person , more a metaphor — to sabotage the debate , trample the rules , and cheat to win . When one Crowley rolls aside , a Donna Brazile emerges to find a surrogate to pass along debate questions surreptitiously . In such a volatile environment of static , of a new tyrannical left that honors none of America ’ s rules of civil engagement , the political left shamelessly rejects the voters ’ choice to render it the “ Loyal Opposition ” and instead remarkably proclaims itself “ The Resistance. ” To counter , the pugnacious and divisive Trump emerges as the new-and-improved iteration of conservatives simply trying to be heard over a media din of dogmatic liberalism pocked by their coordinated corruption of conservative ideas and proposals , augmented by their blackout of any and all positive news of the good things that conservatives do and the excellent results that implemented conservative programs accomplish .\nIn such a public environment where the climate indeed has changed , it emerges that our flawed President is the right man for the wrong time . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "485": "Wearing pink , pointy-eared hats , hundreds of thousands of women took to the streets in the nation 's capital and cities around the world Saturday to send Donald Trump an emphatic message that they wo n't let his agenda go unchallenged over the next four years .\n`` We march today for the moral core of this nation , against which our new president is waging a war , '' actress America Ferrera told the Washington crowd . `` Our dignity , our character , our rights have all been under attack , and a platform of hate and division assumed power yesterday . But the president is not America . ... We are America , and we are here to stay . ''\nThe turnout in the capital was so big that crowds packed the entire march route , preventing organizers from leading a formal trek toward the White House . Likewise , in Chicago , organizers canceled the march portion of their event for safety reasons after the overflow crowd reached an estimated 150,000 .\nThe women brandished signs with slogans such as `` Women wo n't back down '' and `` Less fear more love '' and decried Trump 's stand on such issues as abortion , health care , gay rights , diversity and climate change . Their message reverberated at demonstrations around the globe , from New York , Philadelphia , Chicago and Los Angeles to Paris , Berlin , London , Prague , Sydney and beyond .\nBoston professor Garland Waller , 66 , part of the Washington mobilization , said she was `` devastated '' after the election and had to take action . `` I do n't know what to do to make a difference anymore , and this feels like a first step , '' she said .\nSaskia Coenen Snyder , a teacher at the University of South Carolina who came to a rally in Columbia , said : `` I 'm not sure we could have picked a more irresponsible , misogynistic and dangerous man to be president . ''\nOfficials said the crowd in Washington could be more than half a million people , more than double expectations . The event appeared to have attracted more people than Trump 's inauguration on Friday , based on figures from transportation officials .\nMore than 600 `` sister marches '' were planned around the world , and plenty of men were part of the tableau , too . Organizers estimated 3 million people would march worldwide .\nSeventy-one-year-old Allan Parachini , who traveled from Hawaii to the Washington march , called it `` the most impressive crowd I 've seen since Woodstock . ''\nRetired teacher Linda Lastella , 69 , who came to Washington from Metuchen , New Jersey , said she had never marched before but felt the need to speak out when `` many nations are experiencing this same kind of pullback and hateful , hateful attitudes . ''\n`` It just seemed like we needed to make a very firm stand of where we were , '' she said .\nAs the demonstrators rallied alongside the National Mall , Trump opened his first full day as president by attending a prayer service at the Washington National Cathedral , a tradition for the day after inauguration , and later visited the CIA . As he traveled around town , his motorcade passed large groups of protesters that would have been hard to miss .\nMarlita Gogan , who came to Washington from Houston for the inauguration , said police advised her family not to wear their `` Make America Great Again Hats '' as they walked through crowds of protesters while playing tourist on Saturday .\n`` I think it 's very oppressive , '' she said of the march atmosphere . `` They can have their day , but I do n't get it . ''\nOn the streets , feminist leader Gloria Steinem described the worldwide mobilization as `` the upside of the downside : This is an outpouring of energy and democracy like I have never seen in my very long life . ''\n`` Sometimes we must put our bodies where our beliefs are , '' she told the crowd , labeling Trump an `` impossible president . ''\nHillary Clinton , who lost to Trump , took to Twitter to thank the participants for `` standing , speaking and marching for our values . ''\nThe marches displayed a level of enthusiasm that Clinton herself was largely unable to generate during her campaign against Trump , when she won the popular vote but he outdistanced her in the electoral vote .\nAt rallies around the world , many participants wore hand-knit `` pussyhats '' — a message of female empowerment aimed squarely at Trump 's crude boast about grabbing women 's genitals .\nThey `` ai n't for grabbing , '' actress Ashley Judd told the Washington crowd .\nThe marches were a magnet for A-list celebrities , unlike Trump 's inauguration , which had a deficit of top performers .\nCher , in the nation 's capital , said Trump 's ascendance has people `` more frightened maybe than they 're ever been . '' In Park City , Utah , it was Charlize Theron leading demonstrators in a chant of `` Love , not hate , makes America great . '' In New York , actresses Helen Mirren and Cynthia Nixon and Whoopi Goldberg joined a crowd of protesters marching to Trump 's local home .\nTens of thousands of protesters squeezed into London 's Trafalgar Square . In Paris , thousands rallied in the Eiffel Tower neighborhood in a joyful atmosphere , singing and carrying posters reading `` We have our eyes on you Mr. Trump '' and `` With our sisters in Washington . '' Hundreds gathered in Prague 's Wenceslas Square in freezing weather , mockingly waving portraits of Trump and Russia 's Vladimir Putin .\n`` We are worried about the way some politicians talk , especially during the American elections , '' said organizer Johanna Nejedlova .\nIn Sydney , thousands of Australians gathered in solidarity in Hyde Park . One organizer said hatred , bigotry and racism are not only America 's problems .\nThe rallies were a peaceful counterpoint to the window-smashing unrest that unfolded on Friday when self-described anarchists tried to disrupt the inauguration . Police used pepper spray and stun grenades against demonstrators . More than 200 people were arrested . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

    "487": "You might have heard about the latest cultural outrage incident : Vice President-Elect Mike Pence attended a performance of the mega-hit musical Hamilton and , after it was over , a member of the cast read a brief statement expressing `` alarm and anxiousness '' about President-Elect Donald Trump 's policies .\nAfter thanking Pence for attending , Brandon Victor Davis ( who plays Aaron Burr in the production ) said this :\n`` We , sir — we — are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us , our planet , our children , our parents , or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights . We truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us . ''\nTonight , VP-Elect Mike Pence attended # HamiltonBway . After the show , @ BrandonVDixon delivered the following statement on behalf of the show . pic.twitter.com/Jsg9Q1pMZs — Hamilton ( @ HamiltonMusical ) November 19 , 2016\nPence later noted that he was n't offended by the statement and remained committed to bringing all Americans together in the wake of a highly divisive presidential campaign .\nThe Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man , Mike Pence . Apologize ! — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) November 19 , 2016\nPublic reaction was similarly mixed : liberals cheered the cast of Hamilton for exercising their free speech rights to stand up on behalf of marginalized Americans who have every ███ to fear a Trump presidency , while conservatives lamented the disrespect shown the vice president .\nBut libertarians appear split , too . Libertarian economist and author Steve Horwitz echoed my political-correctness-backlash-aided-Trump theory in his post on the Hamilton kerfuffle , writing on Facebook : `` Want to understand one big ███ why Trump won ? Just look at what the cast of Hamilton did when they discovered Pence was in attendance last night . There is your urban/professional media consumers elitism right there . ''\nMy point in the Hamilton post was not that I disagree with the cast 's concerns , but that when leftists do things like that , it 's exactly what makes many people feel like they are being condescended to and treated like rubes for having voted a certain way or thinking a certain way . Or because they do n't think everything should be politicized . You piss them off at your own peril . They do n't respond well to seeing elected officials disrespected too , even if I 'm all in favor of it .\nMeanwhile , libertarian comedian Jeremy McLellan complained about libertarians who believe , `` Trump won because of some stuff I already thought before he won . Truly an amazing coincidence . '' ( Yeah , he considers me to be one of those libertarians . ) On Hamilton and Pence , he writes :\nOne of the most common characteristics of abusers that I noticed when I worked with people with disabilities was the attitude that the client 's resistance to the abuse was itself thought of as justification for the abuse . Once that feedback loop is established , control is justified through both acquiescence and resistance , and there 's nothing the client can do ( behavior wise ) to escape . The same holds true for abusive relationships , prisons , police , or any other kind of authoritarian regime . The broader message is `` Your resistance to my behavior is the ███ I behave this way in the first place . '' Remember this over the next four years when you hear the trope `` See this is why Trump won . '' If you call his appointees racist , that 's why Trump won . If you boo Mike Pence , that 's why Trump won . If you protest in the streets , that 's why Trump won . If you insult him or his supporters , that 's why Trump won . It 's a rhetorical tool for neutering resistance . Always ask what function it serves .\n1 . This should go without saying , but it 's absolutely fine for actors to use their platform to criticize the president or vice president after a performance . This is n't bullying . You ca n't really bully the second most powerful person in the country . He always has more power than you .\n2 . The actor 's statement was n't even particularly mean-spirited . Rather , it expressed well-founded concerns about the kinds of policies President Trump has vowed to enact . Trump has promised to deport immigrants , bar Muslims from entering the country , and generally sides with the police over communities of color . It 's perfectly legitimate for members of those groups to be worried—and for their allies to be worried , on their behalf .\n3 . As evidence of the fact that the statement was n't `` offensive '' ( and who cares if it was ? ) , I would cite the fact that Pence was n't offended .\n4 . Trump 's tweets about the incident were revealing in that they appropriate the language of leftist grievance mongering . Trump said Pence was `` harassed '' and that the theater should be a safe space . If you think it 's pathetic when students complain about their delicate feelings being hurt by inappropriate Halloween costumes , you should probably also roll your eyes at the idea of the most-powerful man in the country feeling micro-aggressed by an encore .\n5 . The fact that Trump complains about this sort of thing is yet more evidence of a disturbing truth : he is vastly more easily offended than the average politician . No one should actually expect Trump to destroy political correctness : he is just as offended by hard truths and defined by identity politics as the leftists he defeated in the election .\n6 . One more thing about Trump : narcissism , thin skin , and a penchant for authoritarian solutions are quite the toxic mixture .\n7 . All that said , it could still be the case that people are wrong to be outraged about Hamilton standing up to Pence , but are outraged , nevertheless . Perhaps some people are sick of the relentless politicization of all facets of life . Maybe they think they should be able to attend a play , or watch an awards show , or sit through a Thanksgiving dinner without being constantly lectured about how wrong and stupid they are .\n8 . Like Horwitz , I would prefer to live in a world where elected officials were shown less respect , because people who want to take away our rights ( and that 's nearly all of them ) do n't deserve it . But supporters of individual liberty have to be tactical . If Hamilton-esque demonstrations actually drive people into the arms of Trump , there may be cause to eschew such theatrics on purely pragmatic grounds .\n9 . Many people , including many libertarians ( McLellan , for instance ) think this thesis is fundamentally wrong , or at least unproven : political correctness is n't a significant factor that explains Trump 's win . Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting points out that most of the people promoting this explanation—Bill Maher , Jonathan Haidt , George Will , David Brooks , Damon Linker , and yours truly— '' hated identity politics to begin with '' and are thus guilty of confirmation bias . It 's true that we do n't know exactly what 's in the hearts and minds of Trump voters , and there are no comprehensive polls asking them why they did what they did . So yes , the political correctness theory is a bit speculative , and is being advanced by people who were already concerned about political correctness . But it 's not hard to connect the dots : when surveys of Trump voters are done , political correctness invariably comes up . Personally , I have received emails from Trump voters who told me that political correctness was exactly why they voted the way they did . If there 's a danger in making too much of this theory , there 's also a danger in writing it off .\n10 . That 's because virtually no one in the media saw Trump 's win coming , and political correctness has something to do with that . The polls were wrong ( partly ) because people who planned to vote for Trump did not admit this to pollsters . The kind of person who supported Trump is someone who believes that he could n't be honest or vocal about what he thinks , and saved his rebellion against political correctness for the ballot box . This left foes of Trump less prepared for what was coming . The `` unbearable smugness '' of the liberal media , as CBS 's Will Rahn describes it , blinded us to reality .\nLibertarians and other advocates of a free society should recognize that those inclined to resist Trump and Pence are allies , and that includes the cast of Hamilton­ . But such tactics deserve serious scrutiny , even if they are justified . The point is to stop Trump , not just feel better about having made some futile gesture of resistance . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "488": "What does the future have in store for us if Congress succeeds in impeaching President Donald Trump , the president who presides over the best economy America has had in the last 50 years ? I think you can look to South America for a glimpse of the Great Republic that will be vouchsafed us by the congressgirls from what is called “ the Squad ” and from the most foul-mouthed field of Democratic candidates ever to run for the presidency . Already the Democratic National Committee has asked the candidates to avoid crude back-alley language in their debates , and NBC News has requested that they abide by the guidelines of the FCC .\nLast week as many as a million Chileans poured into the streets of Santiago demanding that President Sebastián Piñera step down and that someone confect a new constitution for the country that a generation ago was saved from communism by the dictator Augusto Pinochet . Irving Kristol , the wise 20th-century political commentator , was given to saying that the problem with South America was that its leaders could not govern themselves . The Latin Americans now swarming over our southern border and rampaging through the streets of Santiago are still more evidence of Kristol ’ s wisdom .\nA former Chilean government minister , Sergio Bitar , who is trying to bring the political parties together in Chile , last week expressed his frustration , saying , “ There ’ s no political or social rationality ” for the protests . Viewing the destruction , he explained , “ It ’ s a sickness of destruction. ” It seems that way to me , Mr. Bitar , but now the Colossus to the North is on a similar path . The Squad ( the synonyms of which , for instance “ gang ” or “ mob , ” bring to mind fascism ) and the foul-mouthed politicians seeking the Democratic nomination want our fairly elected president removed from office one year before the citizenry holds another election . Moreover , they are very impatient with the Constitution that has governed our country for more than 200 years . Already Congressgirl Ocasio-Cortez has denounced the Electoral College as a “ scam. ” I think she thinks its tuition is exorbitant .\nPeter J. Wallison , one of the most astute political observers today , has written that if the Squad and the Democrats have their way and President Trump is impeached — even if he is acquitted — the strength of the presidency and the steadiness and reliability of our government are finished . If this impeachment succeeds , we are on our way to becoming a country with the fixity of South American countries .\nWallison writes , “ If Congress could remove a president from office — in other words , overturn an election — for insubstantial reasons , it will destroy the stability of the presidential office in the future . Any time that Congress is controlled by an opposing political party , the president will be in danger of impeachment for some minor offense . ”\nThe Constitution requires that the president commit “ Treason , Bribery , or other High Crimes and Misdemeanors ” to be impeached . An impeachable act has to be equivalent to treason or bribery or other high crimes or misdemeanors . For the duly elected president to talk to a foreign leader in the course of a wide-ranging conversation about foreign aid in July and do nothing to stop that foreign aid shipment in September is not a high crime . It might be a sign of lapsed judgment , especially when the president knows that other White House staffers of questionable loyalty are listening in on the telephone call . But it is not a crime .\nYet such heretofore minor lapses are going to hamstring our presidents for years to come . It will be a new day for America . Get used to the tumult of the last few years to continue for years to come . It is a great irony to see the Democratic Party , the party that has long favored a strong president capable of taking on powerful enemies of the people — the giant corporations ! the health-care industry ! the National Rifle Association ! — in the future being hampered by fears of impeachment threats . Either that or our presidents will be met by riots in the street when they want to do the really grand thing . And the Republican Party — what will it favor ? Probably the strong chief executive .\nIf this impeachment comes about , we are about to see the parties change their roles : the Democrats for an easily impeached president and the Republicans for a strong president .

    "489": "When Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder occupied positions of power in the federal government , they would often lecture conservatives on the virtues of civility and dialogue . To counter Rush Limbaugh and the power of talk radio in the 1990s , rattled liberals once proposed “ civility ” boards , recruiting such models of civility as Paul Begala to serve on the “ Penn Commission , ” an undertaking so stupid it didn ’ t even last Bill Clinton ’ s presidency .\nIn power , liberals peddle self-serving babble about “ civility ” ; out of power — witness Hillary ’ s recent pitiful interview and Eric Holder ’ s endorsement of kicking conservatives — they peddle self-serving babble about the need to suspend civility .\nNotice that the same media burbling over the Hillary-Holder call for a suspension of civility until liberals claw back to power tut-tutted Kanye West ’ s remarks on Thursday in the Oval Office . Journalists normally ooh and aah over vulgar rap and wax nostalgic about Muhammad Ali . But they suddenly turned delicate on Thursday , lamenting Kanye West ’ s “ foul ” language . It was all too much for them . MSNBC ’ s Stephanie Ruhle , whose maturity level is roughly that of an elementary school student , declared Kanye West ’ s presence in the Oval Office a degradation , though surely his high-spirited if rough remarks soiled that august office less than the pastimes of one of her favorite presidents , Bill Clinton .\nThe media ’ s meltdown over Kanye ’ s trip to the Oval Office reflects nothing more than its horrified realization that Trump is eating the left ’ s lunch , poaching more and more voters from once-monopolized lib constituencies . Apparently Kanye West is supposed to check with the central office of the Left ’ s Ministry of Truth before opening his mouth . Anything less is “ surreal , ” according to the media . What a bunch of totalitarian creeps .\nIt still doesn ’ t occur to liberals that the hysteria with which they greet any political dissent from minority communities explains why more and more members of those communities want to get the hell away from the suffocating political correctness of the Democrats .\nThe prim self-righteousness of liberalism against a Trump or Kanye West always comes off as absurd , since liberalism , philosophically speaking , prides itself on its lack of restraining principles . Insofar as it recognizes no divine law prior to man ’ s will , liberalism sanctions all manner of incivility . Hence , an Eric Holder , once stripped of power , can ’ t think of any principled reason for going high if opponents go low . Indeed , given the relativism underpinning liberalism , the temptation to violence is irresistible for most lefties , especially in times of political exile . Many of the heroes of Hillary and Holder are figures of violence and monstrous incivility — from Fidel Castro and Che Guevara to Bill Ayers and the Black Panthers . Around the start of Trump ’ s presidency , the New York Times couldn ’ t even bring itself to condemn a play in Central Park in which a Trumpian figure is stabbed to death . Upper West Side liberals thought that theatrical Trumpicide great fun , and they have welcomed back into their salons the comedienne Kathy Griffin , who was temporarily and grudgingly banished for holding up a mock-severed head of Trump .\nHolder ’ s old boss launched his political career in the living room of a domestic terrorist , Bill Ayers , who on 9/11 ( coincidentally ) took to the pages of the New York Times to gloat that he was “ guilty as hell and free as a bird. ” The mammoth biography on Obama by David Garrow — which arrived stillborn in bookstores owing to its semi-critical tone ( liberals don ’ t want to hear anything but praise about their hero ) — establishes that Obama ’ s attempts to distance himself from Ayers were utterly dishonest . The two were close neighborhood pals in Chicago — a friendship that did not contradict the liberalism of an Obama or a Holder but simply reflected its intrinsically uncivil character and gravitation to violent radicalism . All of the ideologies that shape modern liberalism reject a divinely mandated moral law , which in the end is the only real source of civility and sanction on violence .\nOnce humanity ’ s will is the measure of morality , as liberalism has asserted for 400 years or so , everything in principle is permitted and politics becomes a power grab that culminates in totalitarianism . Under liberalism , the central question of politics invariably shifts from goodness to power , thus rendering civil discourse an impossibility . Out of such a raw , grabby culture come low demagogues like Holder and Hillary , for whom the ends justify any means . Long before Kanye West entered the Oval Office , civility vanished from it , often at the hands of preening liberals like Clinton and Obama who extolled it the most . \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

    "492": "The Cato Institute , a libertarian think tank , is calling on Congress to investigate whether the FBI is spying on it and other domestic political groups after public records requests raised the possibility that the Bureau has files on Cato and others .\nPatrick Eddington , a research fellow at Cato , has submitted more than 200 Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) requests for FBI files on political advocacy groups , civil liberties organizations , think tanks , and publications across the political spectrum .\nFor about two dozen of those requests so far , the FBI said it could neither confirm or deny whether it had collected national security or foreign intelligence records on the groups . Those organizations include the immigrant rights group Kids in Need of Defense ; the Transgender Law Center ; former Rep. Ron Paul 's ( R–Texas ) Campaign for Liberty ; the grassroots Fourth Amendment advocacy group Restore the Fourth ; the Cato Institute ; and the ███ Foundation , which publishes ███ .\n( You can see the Justice Department response upholding the FBI 's refusal to confirm or deny the existence of national security or foreign intelligence records on ███ here . )\nIn a press release issued Tuesday , the Cato Institute said the responses `` reveal the need for Congress to launch an aggressive investigation into FBI domestic surveillance practices . ''\nThe well-worn `` can neither confirm nor deny '' phrase is known as a `` Glomar response . '' The term originated from a 1975 FOIA lawsuit by a Rolling Stone journalist against the CIA seeking records on the Glomar Explorer , a salvage ship the spy agency used in an audacious attempt to recover a sunken Soviet nuclear submarine .\nA federal judge ruled that the CIA could refuse to acknowledge the existence of such records if doing so would in and of itself compromise national security . The Glomar doctrine has since spread to other federal agencies , and even trickled down to state and local government agencies , such as the NYPD .\nA Glomar response , by design , obscures any attempt to discern the government 's activities , or lack thereof . The responses Eddington received could mean absolutely nothing .\nHowever , Eddington says that , while the Glomar responses do n't prove that the FBI has collected intelligence on these groups , their selective use at least raises the troubling possibility that the groups mentioned above were targeted for unconstitutional surveillance or information gathering .\n`` We know for a fact that Glomar invocations have been used to conceal actual , ongoing activities , and we also know that they 're not passing out Glomars like candy , '' Eddington , a former CIA analyst , says in an interview with ███ .\nThe FBI has a long and sordid history of spying on dissident political groups , from early 20th century socialists and labor organizers , to civil rights leaders and post-9/11 environmentalists and peace activists , to Black Lives Matter protesters .\nIn 2013 , The Guardian reported that the FBI kept files and created `` threat assessments '' on the co-founders of Antiwar.com for six years because of a mix-up . Last September , the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the FBI had to expunge its surveillance records on the site .\n`` We are a post-Edward Snowden organization , and so it is a matter of particular concern to us that we may be under surveillance in some sense by the FBI , '' says Alex Marthews , national chair of Restore the Fourth . `` We would consider it highly inappropriate if we were , because we know our activities to be entirely peaceful and constitutional . ''\nEddington says that any such surveillance is inimical to freedom of speech .\n`` Anytime [ the FBI ] is engaged in gathering that kind of data on news organizations or on domestic groups that are exercising their First Amendment rights , that activity should be expressly prohibited in the absence of a genuine criminal predicate , '' Eddington says . `` It should absolutely be prohibited .

    "493": "The one millennial-focused panel on the Conservative Political Action Conference ( CPAC ) main-stage Thursday was titled `` FREE stuff vs FREE-dom : Millennials ' Love Affair with Bernie Sanders ? '' It got worse from there .\nWhile the panelists—only one of whom was a millennial—had a lot to say against socialism of the Venezuelan or Sanders sort , they failed to so much as mention the socialist tendencies rising in their own ranks . The Donald Trump administration , Trump voters , and the `` alt right '' have all expressed support for socialism-lite policies , from trade restrictions to mandated maternal leave . Why the new `` conservatism '' looks so much like the old socialism might have made for an interesting conversation , but instead we heard the same tired tirades about Obamacare and socialized medicine , ignorant kids lionizing Che Guevara , the Marxism found in academia , and how Democrats are `` normalizing socialism . ''\nWhen asked why young people might express nominal support for socialism , only Florida state Rep. Ron DeSantis offered any structural critique , citing the economic mess millennials inherited as one not-ridiculous ███ they might be wary of capitalism . For the other panelists—Ana Quintana of the Heritage Foundation , Greg Dolin of the American Conservative Union Foundation , and Mercedes Schlapp of The Washington Times—it was simply a sign that millennials `` have absolutely no concept of reality , '' as Quintana put it .\nAsked what might bring Bernie-loving millennials around to Republicans or capitalism , the panelists continued to bash Democratic policies such as the Affordable Care Act and the socialist policies that wrecked Venezuela . But they still failed to offer any positive visions of their own . It served as a stark reminder why the Republican Party does so dismally with young folks—in polls , just around 20 percent of millennials tend to identify as Republican—and why provocateurs such as Milo Yiannopolous and others of his ilk are able to command such a share of young , right-of-center attention .\nFor all the things establishment conservatives think millennials should be against , they have a hard time articulating what young people should be for , how that relates to the Republican Party , and how conservatism and capitalism can help young people accomplish the things that they think big government is needed for .\nMeanwhile , at CPAC 's millennial session , the panelists pondered instead how to make millennials more patriotic . They concluded that it might help them to visit Washington monuments and the Arlington Cemetery .

    "494": "James O ’ Keefe ’ s Project Veritas has struck again : This time , a senior CNN producer was caught on camera by one of O ’ Keefe ’ s investigators admitting that the network ’ s relentless bashing of President Donald Trump with the Russia scandal lacks proof .\n“ Could be bullshit . I mean , it ’ s mostly bullshit right now , ” the CNN producer , John Bonifield , said in a video O ’ Keefe ’ s Project Veritas released on Tuesday , when asked about his thoughts on the Russia investigation . “ Like , we don ’ t have any giant proof . Then they say , well there ’ s still an investigation going on . And you ’ re like , yeah , I don ’ t know . If they were finding something we would know about it . The way these leaks happen , they would leak it . They ’ d leak . If it was something really good , it would leak… . The leaks keep leaking and there ’ s so many great leaks , and it ’ s amazing . I just refuse to believe that if they had something really good like that that wouldn ’ t leak because we ’ ve been getting all these other leaks . So , I just feel like they don ’ t really have it but they want to keep digging . And so I think the president is probably right to say , like , look you are witch hunting me . You have no smoking gun . You have no real proof . ”\nThe video also shows Bonifield admitting that he has not seen evidence that Trump has committed any crimes .\n“ I haven ’ t seen any good evidence to show the president committed a crime , ” Bonifield says in the video .\nAnd even if Russia did try to influence the U.S. election , Bonifield is heard saying in the video , that is not really much of a scandal . He is seen arguing that Russian efforts to influence the election would be normal , and that the U.S. government does the same thing around the world all the time .\n“ Even if Russia was trying to swing an election , we try to swing their elections , our CIA is doing shit all the time , we ’ re out there trying to manipulate governments , ” Bonifield says .\nBonifield is a supervising producer for CNN Health . According to his biography on CNN ’ s website , Bonifield works with the CNN Medical Unit and “ primarily with CNN Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen . ”\nThese startling admissions from a CNN producer on hidden camera video come amid many other comments the video shows him making that are particularly problematic for a network in crisis . The Project Veritas video was released on Tuesday amid the worst scandal in CNN history . Zucker , the network president , is currently leading an internal investigation into a very fake news hit piece that CNN published Thursday night then retracted late Friday after a ███ investigation . He is joined , per reports from BuzzFeed News , by the head of HR inside CNN at the top of the investigation . Three of CNN ’ s senior-most editorial staffers have resigned as a result of the growing scandal .\nIn narration over the video , O ’ Keefe notes that “ Bonifield has worked for CNN as a journalist and producer for nearly 15 years . ”\n“ He not only gave us a tour of CNN ’ s main newsroom , he gave us a window into the editorial bias and anti-Trump agenda of the organization , ” O ’ Keefe says .\nO ’ Keefe ’ s Project Veritas is billing this video as part one of a multi-part investigation into what they call : “ American Pravda . ”\n“ Fake News : We start our American Pravda investigations inside American media with part one : CNN , ” O ’ Keefe says in the video . “ Our goal is to expose the real motivations behind the decision-making process at our dominant media corporations . Fake News . One story has monopolized President Trump ’ s time in office like no other , especially on CNN : Russia . In fact , since the Inauguration , CNN has mentioned Russia on their air nearly 16,000 times . So we sent our undercover reporters inside CNN to understand why and to determine if CNN even believes if the story is even real . ”\nIn addition to those aforementioned revelations in the Project Veritas video , Bonifield is shown on camera saying the reason CNN leadership and management is so focused on the Russia scandal despite the lack of real proof is “ because it ’ s ratings . ”\n“ Our ratings are incredible right now , ” the video from Project Veritas shows Bonifield saying .\nIn the video , Bonifield says that CNN leadership regularly axes coverage of other newsworthy stories to shift coverage back to the Russia story . He provided as an example of the network ’ s coverage of President Donald Trump ’ s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accords—which he is seen saying in the video lasted less than two days—before management deliberately shifted coverage back to the Russia scandal .\n“ My boss , I shouldn ’ t say this , my boss yesterday we were having a discussion about this dental shoot and he goes and he was just like I want you to know what we are up against here , ” Bonifield is seen saying . “ And he goes , just to give you some context , President Trump pulled out of the climate accords and for a day and a half we covered the climate accords . And the CEO of CNN said in our internal meeting , he said good job everybody covering the climate accords , but we ’ re done with it let ’ s get back to Russia . ”\nWhen asked by the Project Veritas investigator if it was the CEO of CNN—according to O ’ Keefe they were referring to CNN president Jeff Zucker—who made that determination , Bonifield is heard saying : “ Yeah . ”\n“ So , even the climate accords , he was like a day or so it ’ s okay but we ’ re moving back to Russia , ” Bonifield says in the video .\n“ It ’ s a business , ” Bonifield says in the video . “ People are like the media has an ethical … But , all the nice cutesy little ethics that used to get talked about in journalism school , you ’ re just like , that ’ s adorable . That ’ s adorable . This is a business . Especially cable news . Cable news isn ’ t the New York Times , and it ’ s not even like NBC News . I mean NBC News still gets 20 million viewers a night . Cable news is getting a million . So , they got to do what they got to do to make their money . ”\nBonifield is also seen saying in the video that CNN treats President Trump much differently than CNN treated now former President Barack Obama when he was in office .\n“ I think there a lot of like liberal CNN viewers who want to see Trump really get scrutinized , ” the CNN producer is seen saying in the video . “ And I think if we would have behaved that way with President Obama and scrutinized everything that he was doing with as much scrutiny as we apply to Donald Trump , I think our viewers would have been turned off . I think they would have felt like we were attacking him . And I ’ m not saying all of our viewers are super liberals , I think there ’ s just a lot of them . ”\nHe adds that : “ Trump is good for business right now . ” \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

Steyer was one of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ’ s chief financial backer during her presidential campaign .\n“ A Republican Congress once impeached a president for far less . And today , people in Congress and his own administration know that this President is a clear and present danger who is mentally unstable and armed with nuclear weapons , ” Steyer says in the ad , which runs primarily in New York and California , both of which supported Clinton during last year ’ s election .\nThe ads were not paid through Steyer ’ s political arm , NextGen Climate . They point to a website called NeedToImpeach.com , which features an open letter targeting California Sen. Dianne Feinstein ’ s comment that Trump “ can be a good President . ”\nSteyer , who is considering running against Feinstein in next year ’ s election , criticizes Trump in the letter for “ actively sabotaging ” Obamacare and for “ repealing clean air protections and unleashing polluters . ”\n“ He has threatened to reduce aid for millions of American citizens in Puerto Rico who are struggling to survive without drinkable water or electricity — a move that would be a total dereliction of his duty , ” Steyer writes , adding that Trump ’ s Twitter activity is making people anxious about what the president could have in store for the country .\nSteyer used a poll earlier this year to test the political waters in California . He commissioned the poll to gauge how well a possible campaign would fare against fellow Democrats in the 2018 gubernatorial election .\nHe personally spent more than $ 163 million in the last two election cycles supporting Democratic candidates , but the Democratic bundler has since moved “ beyond ” environmental issues .\n“ Under the new Trump administration , progressives can not consider causes in isolation , ” Steyer told reporters in February .

    "496": "A group of 14 Wisconsin parents has filed a lawsuit against a local school district for its policy allowing teachers to address their children by their preferred `` gender identity '' without notifying them first .\nWisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty ( WILL ) , a conservative law firm , filed the 19-page lawsuit on Tuesday on behalf of the parent 's group against the Madison Metropolitan School District ( MMSD ) . The 14 parents were not named in the document .\nThe lawsuit alleges that MMSD 's transgender policy is unconstitutional because it prohibits teachers and staff from informing parents that their children want to switch sexes .\n`` This action seeks to vindicate parents ' fundamental and constitutional right to direct the upbringing of their children , '' the lawsuit argues . `` The Madison Metropolitan School District has violated this important right by adopting a policy designed to circumvent parental involvement in a pivotal decision affecting their children 's health and future . The policy enables children , of any age , to socially transition to a different gender identity at school without parental notice or consent . ''\nWhile parental consent is needed before a child 's name can be changed legally in the district 's official records , the school district policy announced in 2018 says students can be called by their preferred name and gender pronouns without parental permission .\nThe policy states that the district is committed to affirming each student 's self-designated gender identity and the district will strive to `` disrupt the gender binary '' with books and lessons stating that everyone has the right to choose their gender .\nThe school policy allows students to pick new names and pronouns they can use at school regardless of whether they have a parent 's permission . All teachers and district staff must refer to students by their chosen names and pronouns even though the names are n't official in district systems .\nThe parents argue the policy violates the state constitution 's due process clause , which protects parents ' right to raise their children according to the parents ' beliefs .\n`` Madison schools have adopted policies that violate constitutionally recognized parental rights . A public school district should not , and can not , make decisions reserved for parents , '' WILL President and General Counsel Rick Esenberg said in a statement .\nDistrict spokesman Tim LeMonds said Tuesday that the district had not been served with the lawsuit and could not comment until it had a chance to review it . But LeMonds said the district stands by its guidance on transgender and nonbinary students .\nThe lawsuit also argues that keeping parents in the dark about their children 's sexuality interferes with parents ' right to guide their children through life-altering decisions and provide professional help their children may urgently need .\n`` There is no compelling government interest in keeping secret from parents that their child is dealing with gender dysphoria , '' the lawsuit reads .\nThe parents also argue that the policy violates the state constitution 's religious freedom guarantee .\nAll of the parents say they believe God intended humans to be male and female , and the district 's choice to hide students ' gender struggles interferes with their right to guide their children in accordance with their religious beliefs \" \n\nWhich of the following leanings would a political scientist say that the above article has?\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Center\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
