I'm fighting but it's hard knowing that when you reach out, you're only beaten harder.\n\nResponse: &gt; These feelings of anxiety and depression will never leave.  I feel the same way. It's hard too because when someone does believe in you, you can't even tell anymore. Maybe you think it's because they just want to be nice or maybe it's because of other reasons, idk. Just don't keep fighting. If the life you're living isn't making you happy, it's not what you want, why don't you change it? I'm not saying it's easy, or that you even can.

    "42": "Seeker: When did you realize you were depressed?. What were the signs? When did you realize it just a slump or sad mood.\n\nResponse: I realize I had depression for a long time, and sometimes I still doubt I do but that may just be the illness. I just sort of always felt sad, or at most neutral, but I had a good job, finished school, and an active social life. It was the little invisible things that nobody ever saw. Staying in bed awake for hours on weekdays, intentionally isolating myself or lying so I could be alone and mope. I stopped exercising and gained a ton of weight.  Hell I even had suicidal ideation and I just thought it was normal. I want to kill myself but I stop thinking about death and me dying. It sometimes felt like if I stopped existing it would be fine. I knew something was wrong but I was adamant it depression.  Then I went to my doctor thinking I had an anxiety problem and he began to ask THE questions. I knew he was trying to see if I had depression and it caught me by surprise. Of course I lied for most of them. It would be embarrassing; there was no way I was depressed, but the thought had worked its way in. Over the course of a year I did some idle research. I realized suicidal thoughts and a fascination with death are not normal. I matched a lot of my behavior to symptoms of depression. I came to accept it.  All said I was depressed for 3+ years before I realized it. \n\nExplorations are when a mental health counselor shows active interest in a seeker by asking about unstated experiences.

We have mutual friends and I feel like I am losing them. I am so lost. I already have health problems and this is just killing me.\n\nResponse: My boyfriend and i officially broke up yesterday. The pain you are feeling is not foolish nor is it you being weak. When we tend to get into relationships we often more time than not replace friendships with our partners. And as time progresses the person is not just simply a partner but a friend whom is apart of the very foundation our life is build upon. I am not sure why you two broke up. And i know it hurts extremely bad, and life has lost much of its meaning. I will it try to come up with some lighthearted crap that tells you everything is going to disappear quickly. This will be tough, this will hurt, and at times it will feel like nothing at all is worth living for. But i must tell you this feeling is temporary..... it will not last forever. How long it will last i cannot say, when it will end i cannot say either. But take it one day at a time. Do things that are only necessary for your existence. And those that are extra if you are not up to it do it. Within the relationship i am sure there were flaws on both parts, beat yourself up about them. When the time is right started to fix those things. And if in months or weeks time you feel like you want to reach out to see if anything can be rekindled do so. But you as a person have to stand alone so if or when this may happen it will not shake your entire life.

(kind and excitable and loving) when you're suffering, first and foremost what you need is to get better. being loved, by family or friends or a partner, is part of that. having a partner is not essential, though. i can talk about this for hours if you want me to, but it's important for any relationship you have to be healthy and not turn toxic. you are not a burden, you are not unlovable. at this point in your life people who you have close relations with have to be able to understand and support you. and you deserve that, and those people exist. it can be hard to imagine, when people are depressed their life is usually not in a state where they're very connected to like-minded people. but anything can happen, and things can change. and even without change, you can encounter great things. i can tell you about my experience if you ever want. \n\nExplorations are when a mental health counselor shows active interest in a seeker by asking about unstated experiences.

Please see a professional- a doctor or a therapist or something. Self harm is very serious. I have been doing it for many years, and it is a difficult addiction to break out of.

He's my best friend and we have been through hell together. I am a mess. I don't know what to do. I am in school right now and I feel no motivation. I can't sleep, I can't eat, and I can't breathe. I went to a counselor today but it didn't help much. I feel so lost, and I dont know what to do. I'm so lonely, my friends haven't been much help. We have mutual friends and I feel like I am losing them. I am so lost. I already have health problems and this is just killing me.\n\nResponse: My boyfriend and i officially broke up yesterday. The pain you are feeling is not foolish nor is it you being weak. When we tend to get into relationships we often more time than not replace friendships with our partners. And as time progresses the person is not just simply a partner but a friend whom is apart of the very foundation our life is build upon. I am not sure why you two broke up. And i know it hurts extremely bad, and life has lost much of its meaning. I will it try to come up with some lighthearted crap that tells you everything is going to disappear quickly. This will be tough, this will hurt, and at times it will feel like nothing at all is worth living for. But i must tell you this feeling is temporary..... it will not last forever. How long it will last i cannot say, when it will end i cannot say either. But take it one day at a time. Do things that are only necessary for your existence. And those that are extra if you are not up to it do it. Within the relationship i am sure there were flaws on both parts, beat yourself up about them. When the time is right started to fix those things. And if in months or weeks time you feel like you want to reach out to see if anything can be rekindled do so. But you as a person have to stand alone so if or when this may happen it will not shake your entire life.

Art has been my obsession all of my life but i'm so bad at it because i'm an idiot. a cognitively deficient fuck up is what i am\n\nResponse: Nah man, What you're saying is actually quite common of someone who is good at art. Most people with a high degree or artistic talent are really good at *recognizing* good art, but get frustrated because their own art doesn't live up to the crazy high standard they've set for themselves. Malcom Gladwell suggests that it takes 10,000 hours to gain mastery in something. Art is a skill just like anything else. I think a lot of people get fooled into this You either have it or you don't mentality when it comes to creative arts. It's just not the case.

    "241": "Seeker: one question. I'll keep it simple. Can there be happiness in despair? Because I think I felt it and I want to kill off any hope that's left for me.\n\nResponse: That's a pretty profound question, but I think happiness is something that a lot of people don't understand. In a period or prolonged period of despair, I don't believe there can be happiness at all, and it's only after that period has been solved, over, attacked enough by effort and time, that you can start experiencing happiness. I don't think happiness and gratitude should be forced, or you should try to feel happy when you truly cannot feel happy. I'm still going through that period, and there might be rivets or jewels of happiness along the way, but they are fleeting and leave very quickly. The whole reason why people despair is because they are tied so strongly to negative emotional memories that they outweigh any trivial positive emotional memories. Think about it, which memories are the quickest, strongest, and most easily able to be remembered for you? The most emotional ones. If your most emotional memories are negative, you will be in despair. On the converse, if one's most emotional memories are positive, you will be in a state of happiness. There is a way to end your despair, you just have to face it head on and let go of everything, and keep trying to let go and accept. Very few people have any science on this and might be the thing we need to explore the most as a society as a whole. \n\nExplorations are when a mental health counselor shows active interest in a seeker by asking about unstated experiences.

    "242": "Seeker: Should you kill yourself if you have no social life?. Should you kill yourself if you have no social life?\n\nResponse: No. Not having a social life isn't a terminal diagnosis. Why kill yourself due to lack of social life if you could eventually obtain one? Life is not pass/fail. It's not about getting a certain grade for social life, or any other aspect of life for that matter. You are not a failure. Not having friends worsens depression, depression inhibits the ability to make friends. It's a cycle that needs to be broken, and I recommend getting medical help to tackle depression. Eventually you will get to a point where it is easier to make/maintain relationships, even if it that progress seems small at first.

And I'm so scared actually, I wanna to let at least one person know that I got depression but I'm really scared about his reaction and what he would think.

If they are a trusted friend, they will care and listen to you and be supportive of you. The benefits to discussing this with a trusted friend is they can help you get the help you need and be there for you in the ups and downs. Everyone has had depression, just for some it can be more severe, longer, and more disruptive to one's life. Try to get them to relate by asking about their moments of depression.

Go to a cafe or the library or stay in your dorm (if you're in college)? That's what I tried to do when I was in a studying slump. I went to a cafe instead and it helped a little bit.

At this stage you should be seeking treatments and seeing if you notice any differences in how you feel. I'd recommend running outdoors for 45 minutes at least 5 times a week. This is actually more powerful than antidepressant medication and without unhealthy side effects - on the contrary - it strengthens connections in the brain which are responsible for feeling good.

These letters arent really something I can handwrite in a timely manner without having the courage to keep writing. Do the police access the computer and shift through the belongings to find the letters or wouls I have to send them out myself to have them delivered? What happens to my belongings? If I lock myself in a nonshared dorm room and kill myself, how long would it take to find my body and who would be responsible for cleaning it up? Would it leave my family in debt? Would blowing my head off or hanging myself leave my body in a state where it's unusable for a funeral? I'm turning 20 in 2 months and I'm just too tired. Id like to finally be able to rest and not have to live a conitant life of fear and sadness. As much as I do not want to keep living this kind of life, I am too tired to keep pushing through any longer and I'd just like for my death to be somewhat feasible for my mom and sibling.\n\nResponse: the thing, though, your death be feasible. Your mom and sibling would spend the rest of their lives wondering if it was something they did or said that pushed you over the edge, or thinking about what they could have done differently to be there for you. One of both of them would likely spiral into a depression of their own. I used to think that no one would miss me much if I killed myself, but always remember the sound of my brothers voice when he found me with blood pouring from my arm. That something that you can just get over. Even leaving notes really help the pain for your family. Also consider the suffering of the people who found you. It could be an RA or a dorm mate. They would be traumatized for life, with severe PTSD from seeing a dead, decomposing body. That point would be too late for you to do anything, so we try not to let it go that far. get me wrong, I know where coming from, and not trying to make you feel bad for would be wrong. And clear from the fact that even thinking about these things that you have some reservations, so build on that. Take every little good thing that happens to you and imagine never feeling that way again, and imagine robbing the people you love of those feelings as well. Forgive me for being brash, but there is absolutely nothing delicate or glorious about suicide. The people who experience it secondhand go through ten times the suffering of the people who commit it.

People scare and anger me, have for years, and as a result I don't actually have a single person I would consider a friend and have never had a relationship, but I crave that stuff every night. It causes hard insomnia worrying about if I'll have to be alone forever with no friends or partners to the point I can only sleep out of exhaustion, but then once I have and I wake up the next morning, I'll loathe that I have to go outside and interact with people for work. It's a daily nightmare. I would say that MAYBE, if I gave advice on it, it would be that I used to have a similar thing with shyness, and with that I pushed myself into more and more social situations and now am not so shy. It MAYBE might work the same way with liking/disliking social interaction. But I do that everyday and I still don't like people. I'm more COMFORTABLE around them, but I still don't LIKE them. And it's an entirely different ball park with depression/anxiety than shyness, otherwise if it were so easy to just 'force' yourself to socialize to fix the problem, I'd be doing it myself.

I am just feeling so tired of this constant empty feeling inside of my body. I am 16 years old and i just hate school. How should I handle this situation?\n\nResponse: Man I just turned 17 yesterday and I dont think ive had a real life friend since highschool started, so basically I dont think i'll be very helpful but i'd still like to respond. I also dropped out a few weeks ago which I do regret but I just couldnt keep up with the new school I transfered to.  The thing that has been helping me lately, and what my pyschiatrist told me, was to get a hobby. I like to read a lot of japanese books so I picked up on the language so I could start reading them directly from Japan. It's not much of a hobby, reading books and learning a new language, but it gives me something to live for. I want to read a thousand new stories because I love many of the ones I have already read.  I do however think friends are important, although I have none in real life. If anyone at all tries to be your friend, I think you should try and be more open to making friends instead of like me. The last person that tried being friends with me I pushed away a lot and faked most of our friendship, but I regret that since he was willing to put in the effort so I think he deserves to have a good friendship.

Furthermore, fetishes are often believed to be shameful and obscene in nature, because such random, nonsexual items PRODUCE intense satisfaction, whereas people that are accused of fetishizing sadness are just sheltering themselves (if i fuck myself up, no one else will). \n\nExplorations are when a mental health counselor shows active interest in a seeker by asking about unstated experiences.

I just can't leave my friend who just lost a family member to suicide and I'm the closest friend.  &amp;#x200B;  But I just wanna die\n\nResponse: Well at least you still can hold on to that choice. Being terminally ill for the past 7 years (Im 42 now) the physical pain of a slow and horrible illness has led to my depression and desire to die. It is up to my wife though. And for her I live every day in hell. When you have even one person to keep you going, it can be enough.  I am a lurker here and I read posts to give me perspective. Rarely can I physically reply. But what my experience being bound to a bed 24/7 has taught me is that once I made my peace with dying, I became indifferent to everything.  For myself It's been tough to see people truly depressed to the point of wanting to die. I am very empathetic, but my depression is a symptom so its hard to understand. The one thing I do understand though is that the last thing you want to hear is Don't do it!!! Call this number... or other similar programmed/indoctrinated responses.  So just know this... The world and life can be one big shitshow... So it helps to keep toilet paper handy. Let your friend be your toilet paper and be your friends toilet paper. It will be enough.   Lastly... Just remember that no matter how bad life feels (and is...) even I am artificially grateful for the fact that I have a far better life right now (suffering from *pain and bound to a bed), than 99.999999% of all humans to have ever lived. Just try to make it as long as you can. Know how much worse it can be. And let your toilet paper know that you need them to help clean up some shit. Then when you are ready to go.... You will know. But I cant see it happening for you as long as you remain attached to someone that you can call a friend. So give yourself a list of requirements that must be met for you to end it all. *- Pain so severe that causes me to vomit my own feces at times as it sends my body into shock.  I wish you the best. I hope you can suffer less in time if possible. You and I are here right now... That makes us stronger than those who gave up yesterday. (And if you do one day come to the realization that you must go, make sure to do it in a way that allows your organs be given to help others. It helps me knowing that maybe I will have something that can give a healthy, long, and amazing life for a person who is still able to live it. )  Just think about making the list... And go tell your friend, right now, that you love him/her... Even if they are not quilted and only 1-ply thickness. You both need that right now... The whole world needs that right now.

    "466": "Seeker: College graduates/current college students:. How have you gotten through difficult parts of your school year when your depression is severely effecting your academic work? Going through a difficult path this semester and tanked two exams this week already, really looking for some advice to improve.\n\nResponse: Yes, I have. Currently I am a mess. Nevertheless there used to be a time when I was a mess, but still had a reason to pick myself up and get my shit done. If you want to study and pass your exams, this is what I did:  - Get busy studying now (within 15 minutes). No excuses to eat/drink a bit. Not going to the bathroom. Just study. Phone away. If possible laptop/computer away. Do this for at least one hour and take a small break to get fresh air if you want and drink some water. NO PHONE. Then back to studying. Again one hour or more.  - After studying go for a run (I don't care if it is 11 pm) or exercise in some other way. - Eat healthy. You crave good tasting food? chocolate? chips? No go. When you go to the supermarket, fast food is not an option. You will not spend your money on that shit. No chips, no sweet stuff, no special drinks. Fruit/vegetables/carbs/meat/fish/bread/milk/yoghurt. Healthy stuff. Lots of water.  - Go to bed on time. Get out of bed on time. - No thinking! Only actions.  - Do one thing at a time. No thinking about tomorrow or the next hours. Just about the next minute. What are you going to do now? Shower? check. Dress? check. Breakfast? check. Go to library? check. Study one hour? check. Have a small break and drink water? check. continue. - If possible, study with other people - (added) When I get stuck, it has been VERY helpful for me to discuss this with other students. This has been very difficult for me, because I have a crazy amount of pride and am very ashamed of showing I do not understand something. Nonetheless, it has helped me so much to just discuss a problem where i got stuck with someone and then see the light which enables me to continue studying (instead of procrastinating till everything went to shit).  This doesn't solve the deeper problems, but it probably will get you through your exams as good as possible. At least, this is how I managed to finish my undergraduate years. Not healthy, but it worked. Also you will probably find that by being so hard for yourself, setting boundaries and actually following them, you will start to feel a lot better about yourself and gain confidence. This is a trap, do not get satisfied with yourself. Being satisfied and giving yourself more space to slightly cross your boundaries again is equal to getting on the slide that will get you right back into the pit.

    "493": "Seeker: I constantly feel morally and intellectually superior to everyone around me, but with no evidence to back up these feelings.. Like, I'll look around me as I sit in lectures or walk around the university campus and think to myself these people are just so stupid, they understand nothing, they're so shallow and empty-headed, and I feel 100% confident in being right, but then I'll try to logically think about why I'm superior (and I'm also 100% certain that I *am* superior), and I come up with nothing. In any quantifiable measure of superiority, I always fail. And yet, I can't shake this feeling that everyone else is inferior to me. I think maybe it's just a gut reaction because of how unhappy and depressed I am, but I don't know. I know that I probably sound like a complete asshole to anyone reading this, but it's how I honestly feel.\n\nResponse: Maybe it's a defense mechanism you created when you were a child?

    "495": "Seeker: Are there any methods to coping with depression and suicidal thoughts that actually works?. Emotional support does nothing for me yet I see it everywhere. I think many of us need some real help\n\nResponse: Depression isn't something you can get rid of by wishing it away or telling someone you have it. A lot like an addiction you have to fight to get out of it. And it's hard to tell what path is right or wrong. Talking to people does help. But you need to find someone you can talk to. I couldn't talk to my mom for the life of me, my sister would tell my mom or tell me I was wrong, my dad just gave me a look and didn't know what to say besides he cares about me. Once my mom knew the extent of my depression she became better at helping me. She listened and didn't judge. She let me talk and told didn't lecture but reassured my decisions. She went out of her way to make me feel more confident. That's the person you need to find. Also try writing your feeling down whatever you feel on a peace of paper what ever is on your mind. Write it in chicken scratch don't worry about how ty write just write what you feel. Then throw the paper away. That used to help me, not as much as my mom did but I did help. Life isn't something we can live alone although a lot of us want to, I wish I could, find someone to confide in that supports you. \n\nExplorations are when a mental health counselor shows active interest in a seeker by asking about unstated experiences.
