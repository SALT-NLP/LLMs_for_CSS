{"context":{"7165":"Seeker: Circle of my life. I'm depressed and fat, so I eat to feel better. Which then makes me more fat and depressed. It's a never-ending cycle.  I hate myself.\n\nResponse: Same thing happened to me. I used to work for my uncle as a dish washer in a banquet style setting. I didn't do this out of depression but I hate wasting food (a trait I acquired from my grandfather) and lots of food was always being thrown out so guess what I would do? I would eat that delicious food all the time. I gained some 80 or so lbs in about 5 years. Went from 130 to 205. I quit that job about 7 years ago and have since lost most of the weight. I am currently 125 and still trying to get rid of the gut.  &amp;#x200B;  Go to the gym, eat better, and please please please don't give up on yourself.","5380":"Seeker: Exam results in a week. and feeling like complete shit knowing i fucked up my A-Levels badly. I just feel so bad because i let my parents down and that i won't be able to get into university. Also fucking embarrassing telling everyone you've failed them..guess its my fault in the end.\n\nResponse: Are you getting your results on the 10th or 17th of August? And did you write AS or A2?","8272":"Seeker: I did the dishes today. It isn't a huge feat, but after 5 days of sitting around I finally did something to clean my house up.\n\nResponse: Awesome! That's a success in my book. :)  I managed to call someone and spoke to an actual human being about my car yesterday, now if only I could set up all the other appointments I need to lol.  Keep doing small things like that, it helps you feel like you've accomplished something especially when they start to pile up after a bit. Maybe eventually we'll be productive right?","791":"Seeker: It's doesn't necessarily get better; you just learn to live with it and work around it. That will be all. Thank you.\n\nResponse: Woah... that's accurate. The posts in this sub today really reflect me. This is very truthful, I just live with it","6610":"Seeker: Anyone just take a moment to look at themselves in the mirror, and feel like there\u2019s no one looking back?. so weird. Not feeling anything. Just looking and having no emotions showing, sucks.\n\nResponse: I look in the mirror and only see sad, dead eyes looking back.","8186":"Seeker: I don't like to think about the future. because I don't see myself in one.\n\nResponse: you do have a future and i bet going to be a bright one. this is just your depression trying to convince you that hopeless. when this happens to me, i try and plan something fun so that i have something to look forward to!","7067":"Seeker: Just be happy. Sure.. I'll get right on it..\n\nResponse: Lmao, I love it when my asshole father tells me this. Yeah, it really helps. **Like I didn't try THAT for the past 4 years.**","8511":"Seeker: The pain it will bring to my parents is the only reason I am not dead. Funny thing is I thought I was free of depression but it's always there just waiting for a moment to suck you back in\n\nResponse: Yep. You are never 'free' of it. I thought this as well a while back because thing were really going well, but it reared its ugly head again. I am still really suffering through this bout. I am glad you feel your parents would suffer from your death. I wish I thought mine would. (My father is already passed, but I know that the 'suffering' my mother would feel is from the social stigma of having a suicide in the family. It would have nothing to do with losing me.","7088":"Seeker: Depression is [fill in the blank]. Not having enough energy to even flush the toilet\n\nResponse: Having a presention in 15 hours and not preparing for it. and in the next 36 hours of now, an exam in which i have no studied for.","7979":"Seeker: Depression and obsession. Being obsessed with something while being depressed doesn't mix well\n\nResponse: I'm obsessed with video games and spend a lot of time reading or watching videos about them. Unfortunately my depression keeps me from actually being able to play anything. It sucks so much because now I have nothing to go to when I'm feeling down.","8544":"Seeker: Emotional or emotionless. 3:34 am I feel the pain all too well and have for some time and I'm unable to let the feelings out. I am unable to cry\n\nResponse: The thing that drives emotion the most for me is what I want. When I have no clue what I want to achieve or maintain, I can't show any emotion because I have no clue how it affects me. Finding those goals is one the hardest battles but the most rewarding and eye-opening.","7938":"Seeker: Have you ever.... Have you ever been in so deep that you desperately start looking for feely context on the internet in the hopes something makes you cry, but even the worst doesn't do it for you since you are just so numb?\n\nResponse: Yeah i have. I spent a lot of time last year doing that to no avail. Still just as numb and dead inside as i was before.","5002":"Seeker: When you wanna OD but there\u2019s just too much going on.

All day today I've been shaking and my anxiety has been through the roof. I spent my day in bed crying and throwing up. Nothing brought on this panic attack, I've just been awfully down.\n\nResponse: I just get nauseous and anxious","5979":"Seeker: I seem to always be the first to try and help someone else with their problems, yet when I need help nobody seems to be around to be an open ear for me, I wish I had someone in real life who cared enough to listen to me and just let me spill everything out. Anyone else feel this way?\n\nResponse: I'm not entirely certain what reaction you're getting, but I hope you'll give those around you a little slack if they can't be as openly receptive and caring as you need at first. I'm sort of the designated problem solver in my circle, so quite a few of my friends come to me for advice and sympathy. It's never, never a burden. Instead, it's an honor. They trust me with their secrets, their problems, and value my opinion enough to ask for it. Reverse the situation. Aren't you glad when someone comes to you? The thing is, not everyone is built for that. Especially, I have found, it can sort of weird people out when the Rock, the Stable One, the One Person In This Messed Up World Who Has Their Stuff Together needs help. I mean, here's the person they go to and they rely on when they need support... and that person needs support. Suddenly you're not Superman anymore and it can be a bit disconcerting. Perhaps try introducing A problem at a time, slowly, and seeing if they can get used to you also being a normal human with issues. Good luck!!","3650":"Seeker: nothing matters in the end.... everything that we do, its just lost with time.  I just feel like rolling into a ball and cry for the night...\n\nResponse: Have you looked into getting help?","6551":"Seeker: Hey, I'm bad with words but here. I've never really had friends, but I fell in love with someone, and they used me for personal gain, I'm not antisocial I just care about others more than myself, and the pst week I've been so apathetic I can't eat, can someone help me?\n\nResponse: Try to focus on the little things in life that you find joy in. Something I've always struggled with it focusing too much on the big picture and when you do that it often just becomes too much to handle and you get yourself all freaked out.","5514":"Seeker: Anyone else completely useless to society?. I can't get myself to get a job. I dropped out of classes last semester. I do nothing all day but sleep, eat, and smoke pot.\n\nResponse: I feel the exact same way. My ex girl friend broke up with me and got pregnant with another guy . Words can't describe what I went through. Atleast your not buying hard drugs right ? If you are I'm not judging you.","7376":"Seeker: I\u2019m afraid. Not a day goes by where not afraid. I feel alone but I want to be alone in this. I want to burden anyone else and so tired of fighting just to stay alive. tired, lonely and afraid.\n\nResponse: We're 2 in this nightmare. I'm basically living in my head all the time, questioning whatever happens around me and feeling empty af. I'm also afraid of every situation I have to face that I'm not controlling. I feel so drained.","8569":"Seeker: You guys make me feel like I belong. I don't belong anywhere else.\n\nResponse: I love you all. Genuinely the replies here made me feel much less alone. your kindness is beautiful","7750":"Seeker: Do you all hate the news too?. It's always more new depressing shit happening in the world.\n\nResponse: I hate T.V in general. All those fake ass shows with acting makes me throw up in my mouth. My parents think that it's 'entertaining because it's real', no, it's entertaining because they're paid to be entertaining.","7049":"Seeker: How do you guys feel about your birthday?. My birthday is the most depressing day of the year for me. What about you\n\nResponse: Just another day to throw away. Typically with an extra helping of faked emotions and facial expressions to keep my friends and family under the impression that I'm okay on that day, when it's the day I wish didn't happen.  It's fucking exhausting","1630":"Seeker: Lately everyday is a bad day.. Not much else to say.\n\nResponse: I'm sorry. I hope you get a good day soon.","8024":"Seeker: Ashamed. I'm just ashamed of the fact thaf I'm very much one of those people you look at and say they need help. I hate the idea of needing help so much. It just makes me feel broken. I don't want help. I just want to be normal again.\n\nResponse: Same here. You can tell just by looking at me.","6274":"Seeker: That feeling when you look at the dental bill.... ...and could scream in agony, realizing no one but yourself is to blame for abusing you by neglecting your teeth, including expensive previous dental work that's now gone to hell. Depression carries some very heavy lessons.\n\nResponse: That feeling when your teeth are rotting away and you're too scared to go to the dentist.  :(","3164":"Seeker: Getting out of your situation or not is a choice.. Paraphrasing what a former friend used to say. Splendid, I felt so enlightened I could cry tears of joy.\n\nResponse: Well yeah, but what about the relatives and the mess?","7351":"Seeker: Anyone else feel emotionally numb for most of their lives?. The last time I was truly excited for anything was as a kid. But once I grew out of the Christmas excitement age never really been excited for anything since. It seems like other people get excited when friends or family get married or have kids. Even when my brother got married I feel anything about it. never had anyone really close to me die before but even when my grandparents and great grandparents died I feel sad or anything. I really close but I always thought I should have felt something for them. Same thing when someone gets hurt. I remember when my brother broke his arm when I was a teenager and everyone made a big deal of it and I feel a thing. I worried or scared or anything. I just feel like I have the same emotions as everyone else. Anyone else feel this way?\n\nResponse: I guess you just become a realist?  An example, a family was diagnosed with diabetes and the doctors told her that if she waited for another hour before going to the doctor that she could have died. All the family was worried. But me?  I just thought If she dies, well, it was her time.  The things that happen to everyone else don't apply anymore to you. And it terrifies me.","6925":"Seeker: If you had one wish.... What dream profession would you choose?\n\nResponse: Always wanted to be painter. Unfortunately my drawings are not even worth. I do enjoy drawing and painting even though it is abysmal.","6438":"Seeker: What are your strategies for staying functional enough to complete schoolwork, etc?. Due to feeling like garbage, losing memory\/attention, and anxiety, I have trouble doing work for school. Actually, I'm probably just a lazy piece of trash, but the problem still stands. For those who are on top of things: how do you manage it all?\n\nResponse: Lots of cannabis, which I can't even use much anymore since I lost my job","6740":"Seeker: Anyone else just feel completely demorelized and defeated. After years of this depression thing, at some point all you can do is look in hindsight and think wow, this sure has made my life miserable\n\nResponse: Every day my friend...every day","7935":"Seeker: Do you ever feel like there is no future for yourself?. I've failed at doing many things over and over again for a few years. I honestly can't see myself actually suceed in anything in the future. Sometimes I feel like there's no point of living anymore.\n\nResponse: I don't think I've failed that much but that's because I rarely have the power to try anything in the first place. I have no idea where I'm going. I know where I want to, but it takes so much effort to get there and I don't know if I'll have that ability time soon.  What happened that brought you to this point?","3314":"Seeker: What's the point sometimes?. I try and fail. I try again and fail again.

Can't sleep.. Have a tremendous amount of restlessness in myself. Just need to fucking calm down\n\nResponse: When I can't sleep I've taught myself to use it. If I can concentrate I read, if I can't I play video games. Anything that helps me to relax. I tend to find that I need to distract myself from being unable to sleep, otherwise it makes me anxious and that makes the sleeplessness worse.","6645":"Seeker: I'm just having a bad day. It will get better tomorrow\/next week\/ next month\/ next term\/ next year. Spoiler alert: It fucking doesn't\n\nResponse: It really doesn't.  And I feel that the older I become, the less likely that things will actually get better. When I was younger and receiving medical help, there was still the general feeling that I'd eventually grow up and things would be sorted out. Having recently summing up the determination to see a shrink again, I get the feeling that nothing much can be done. I even wonder if I actually have depression. If my life is full of shit, am I really supposed to feel anything but misery?","5598":"Seeker: Struggling with depression and anxiety. I've been struggling with depression and anxiety for over 2 years now. It gotten to the point that I can't control it anymore. Suicidal thoughts occur more and more everyday.

Sorry you're going through this, friend","5391":"Seeker: I want to live my own life. The life I'm living now is for other people. I'm not cut out for this.. No one really believes in me anymore. These feelings of anxiety and depression will never leave. I'm fighting but it's hard knowing that when you reach out, you're only beaten harder.\n\nResponse: &gt; These feelings of anxiety and depression will never leave.  I feel the same way. It's hard too because when someone does believe in you, you can't even tell anymore. Maybe you think it's because they just want to be nice or maybe it's because of other reasons, idk. Just don't keep fighting. If the life you're living isn't making you happy, it's not what you want, why don't you change it? I'm not saying it's easy, or that you even can. I'm just asking I guess if you want to explain why you're stuck living for other people rather than yourself.","6458":"Seeker: Does anyone feel like your problems are insignificant compared others, yet they still seem like a heavy burden?. For example, compared to the lives that some other people had to endure, my life isn't too hard. However, my problems still feel like weights on my mind.\n\nResponse: I hate it when people say that. It makes you feel so guilty for whining.","7525":"Seeker: Happy New Year!!!. Still a broken man, though...\n\nResponse: I know i'm kinda excited because this next year i've got this subreddit and \/r\/wholesomememes","9075":"Seeker: i have barely been to class in 2 weeks. i feel like a fucking failure. i have classes today and i just get the motivation. i want to fail out of school. i want to have to work full time instead. i just want to do anything. i hate myself so much\n\nResponse: I'm going through the same thing right now I can't convince my self to get ready and fix my life it sucks.","6792":"Seeker: Do you ever think depression is actually just being more in tune with how shit life really is?. Like you can dress it up how you want, but it is it?\n\nResponse: I guess people just are born or moulded into different mindsets and a lot of people unfortunately got a shitty one where they struggle to be happy","7788":"Seeker: When did you realize you were depressed?. What were the signs? When did you realize it just a slump or sad mood.\n\nResponse: I realize I had depression for a long time, and sometimes I still doubt I do but that may just be the illness. I just sort of always felt sad, or at most neutral, but I had a good job, finished school, and an active social life. It was the little invisible things that nobody ever saw. Staying in bed awake for hours on weekdays, intentionally isolating myself or lying so I could be alone and mope. I stopped exercising and gained a ton of weight.  Hell I even had suicidal ideation and I just thought it was normal. I want to kill myself but I stop thinking about death and me dying. It sometimes felt like if I stopped existing it would be fine. I knew something was wrong but I was adamant it depression.  Then I went to my doctor thinking I had an anxiety problem and he began to ask THE questions. I knew he was trying to see if I had depression and it caught me by surprise. Of course I lied for most of them. It would be embarrassing; there was no way I was depressed, but the thought had worked its way in. Over the course of a year I did some idle research. I realized suicidal thoughts and a fascination with death are not normal. I matched a lot of my behavior to symptoms of depression. I came to accept it.  All said I was depressed for 3+ years before I realized it.","6606":"Seeker: anyone else feel like they cant do anything?. I just feel like there's nothing that i'm good at. I want to be good at doing something but i have no skills when it comes to the things i wish i could do.\n\nResponse: I feel the same way. unnerving to live in a world with so many talented people who do meaningful work and are achieving so much whereas I can do nothing but watch","6151":"Seeker: why am i depressed?. why am i depressed?  &amp;#x200B;\n\nResponse: Does you happiness rely on other people's behavior?","8529":"Seeker: I\u2019m so fucking lonely. so fucking lonely and I shake the feeling. Alone in my apartment and just know what to do anymore.\n\nResponse: I feel you dude,  I am 25 and I have never had a girlfriend, I don't know how it feels to get hugged, there were never a girl in my life, who said she likes me for who I am.  No friends or family, who are trying to cheer me up. Just me, work and my depressed thoughts that are preventing me to fall asleep every night.  I am so lonely, it feels like deep cuts into my heart. I want to end this fucking pain.","7046":"Seeker: Feels like depression is contagious. Feels like I get home and everybody's chipper mood begins to plummet. It's like I am sapping their life away. Makes you just feel like running the fuck away to spare them feeling as bad as you. It's the worst. What a cruel fucking joke depression is.\n\nResponse: Yeah I feel that way too. I tell people I feel crap, and then they feel sad because I'm down.","7003":"Seeker: Nothing in my life has value. Not my self no friends no family they don't mean anything to me. I would try and kill myself but I would mess that up to.\n\nResponse: Similar boat; my dads going to have an operation soon and may die but I honestly don't know if I even care anymore. He'll die either way. It just seems like trying to live for me is more and more of a lost cause. My best friend is suicidal and may be dead as I'm writing this.

Like going back in time and fixing those shitty mistakes you made. Not even the big stuff, but small things like who you chose to sit next to on the first day of class.  Idk, I've just been thinking about it a lot I guess\n\nResponse: Every single day I wish that I could go back 4 years ago. Back to before my mental health went to the shitter. Do things so differently.","8869":"Seeker: I hate it when my depression lifts just enough for me to be able to try to work on my studies, but not enough to make it easy to stay focused, motivated and productive.. At least when I'm completely hopeless, bordeline suicidal and that I sleep 16 hours\/day I just CAN'T work. I feel even more like a lazy failure when I know that I could work but that it would be reaaaaally hard because I just have no motivation, and trouble concentrating.\n\nResponse: I feel you, I'm in the same situation. My depression and anxiety is just good enough for me to be in uni or work, but never good enough for me to keep the job or do good in school.","6427":"Seeker: :(.

Which is pretty boring desk job. feeling really alone right now and stop thinking about my ex. Looking for anything to distract me\n\nResponse: ex for a reason, right?

Your life is yours, not your let them rule it.","7994":"Seeker: empty inside. nothing brings me joy anymore\n\nResponse: Yeah, with you. longing for the next sincere laugh or anything that I find funny anymore or someone who will play that game with me in real life..","7273":"Seeker: I hate when people tell me to meditate. My depression won't go away if I meditate. It won't get better with fucking breathing. Mindfulness doesn't cure this.\n\nResponse: Meditation helps to rewire the brain... it's how I've stayed med free with bipolar. Your brain starts to go for relaxation and calm instead of a default down feeling or thought. But you have to keep doing it over and over, even when it feels like it's not working. It's not for everyone though! Mindfulness is a way of moving through life slowly for Me, finding little bits of joy in the smallest things like making and drinking a drink. This is what got me out of bed in my darkest days...","9148":"Seeker: It could be only worse.. Life never gets better. Try to accept it.\n\nResponse: Your foundation needs to fall down before you can start rebuilding. Have you started the plans the blueprint? List everything on a paper or make a note in your head what you need to do to make things better. I'm still rebuilding right now. But I don't have this dark ugly building that overshadowed me. Now I can start thinking what the fuck I need to do in order for my new building to be beautiful the way I want it. It'll take time but it's all worth it. Allow yourself to rebuild.","8714":"Seeker: I have nothing to do while I'm free. I'm so bored and doing nothing\n\nResponse: Thats frustrating, Idleness makes me crazy.","5096":"Seeker: Did you ever wanted to do something to feel less miserable, but felt too miserable to actually do anything?. Instead of trying to find a therapist, eating healthy, exercising, spending time with people all I do is is basically sitting in my room, listening to music and eating my feelings. My room is a mess and so is my life, because I hardly ever get anything done.\n\nResponse: Yes. Many, many times that has happened to me.

My boyfriend and I have just broken up for the second time in our 3 year relationship. He's my best friend and we have been through hell together. I am a mess. I don't know what to do. I am in school right now and I feel no motivation. I can't sleep, I can't eat, and I can't breathe. I went to a counselor today but it didn't help much. I feel so lost, and I dont know what to do. I'm so lonely, my friends haven't been much help. We have mutual friends and I feel like I am losing them. I am so lost. I already have health problems and this is just killing me.\n\nResponse: My boyfriend and i officially broke up yesterday. The pain you are feeling is not foolish nor is it you being weak. When we tend to get into relationships we often more time than not replace friendships with our partners. And as time progresses the person is not just simply a partner but a friend whom is apart of the very foundation our life is build upon. I am not sure why you two broke up. And i know it hurts extremely bad, and life has lost much of its meaning. I will it try to come up with some lighthearted crap that tells you everything is going to disappear quickly. This will be tough, this will hurt, and at times it will feel like nothing at all is worth living for. But i must tell you this feeling is temporary..... it will not last forever. How long it will last i cannot say, when it will end i cannot say either. But take it one day at a time. Do things that are only necessary for your existence. And those that are extra if you are not up to it do it. Within the relationship i am sure there were flaws on both parts, beat yourself up about them. When the time is right started to fix those things. And if in months or weeks time you feel like you want to reach out to see if anything can be rekindled do so. But you as a person have to stand alone so if or when this may happen it will not shake your entire life. Become strong from this.","6580":"Seeker: I hate being socially inept.. I want to interact with my friends but I just can't hold a conversation no matter what it is... watching them give up on you because you're so dull is a very painful fate\n\nResponse: I feel you're pain OP. When it comes to texting holding a conversation is like rocket science.","8795":"Seeker: Honestly, if being around other people doesn't make me less lonely, how the heck am I ever supposed to *not* be lonely?. I'm just frustrated about this. I feel lonely and disconnected from other people even when I'm actively engaged in conversation or activities with them...I feel like I just lack some fundamental skill that others have to connect. Can you guys relate?\n\nResponse: Yes. I find maintaining friendships is so exhausting, and I can barely manage the other stuff in my life as is. I know that when I disappear for a bit because it's all too much, no one will be there when I come back.  I also feel like I don't really have much in common with the people I talk to. They're all so motivated and seem to maintain social lives so effortlessly. They talk about their weekends at clubs and hanging out and I think of how I spent my weekend playing video games for 10 hours instead of doing papers and it makes me feel completely isolated.","7861":"Seeker: Winter makes me feel sad. It's so dull, hardly any proper sunlight..\n\nResponse: Me too. I'm supposed to use a sunlamp. But hardly do","8581":"Seeker: Should people have the right to commit suicide?. I wanna here your thoughts\n\nResponse: Absolutely. Where I live I can be killed peacefully in a hospital if I have a terminal physical disease such as cancer. Depression\/Anxiety is also terminal...it kills slower but it is just as painful in different ways.","8065":"Seeker: Last year went poorly in college and I ended up having to repeat the entire academic year. I just showed up to my last Christmas exam today and found out it was on yesterday. I feel like such a failure and want to die.. There's nothing I can do now\n\nResponse: Hey, I know how you feel. Sometimes it's hard to handle daily responsibilities when you're depressed. Everyone fucks up dude. (A practice that is helpful albeit uncomfortable is closing my eyes and breathing, imagining the place that I dread returning to, and picturing myself sitting in there, breathing and at peace. Then I zoom out to the building and picture all the rooms filled with all the other students.. Then I zoom out and picture the exterior... I zoom out and imagine the city view, then the state, then the country, then the hemisphere, then the whole planet, suspended in the I stay there and I just watch it spin slowly. And This puts into perspective that my mistake cannot defeat me.)    I flunked out of college my freshman year and still haven't had the courage to go back, so I commend you for trying again.    And as unsolicited as this is, I gotta say I disagree with the polarizing statement that there isn't anything you can do. You can own your mistake, which you already have. You can brush yourself off and see the mistake in the context of the rest of your life (which is priceless and you are worth so much.) And you can try to do better tomorrow. You are only human. Try and keep your chin up, buddy. (edit* for clarity)","6813":"Seeker: Friendless, jobless, skillless, useless... Anyone in the same boat?\n\nResponse: You are not useless. I used to think the same, but I have always been good at writing and research. I decided to start freelancing my services, and I do quite well for myself. It's no replacement to a full time job just yet, but I really enjoy the freedom and receiving positive client feedback. Everyone has something to offer, just have to make a start..","6812":"Seeker: Should I make everyone hate me before I die?. Maybe I don't even need to\n\nResponse: No, I basically did this and dug myself into a much deeper hole to climb out of.","2611":"Seeker: Today my mom told me to starve myself.. I'm 150lbs now. My mom told me that I'm fat and maybe I need to start starving myself. I feel like absolute crap. I just want to die. I hate my body. I hate being the fat sister in my family.\n\nResponse: Your mom sounds verbally abusive. I'm sorry you feel like this. I hope things get better for you soon.","8385":"Seeker: I'm an honest guy but there's one thing I lie about all the time. Hey! Hi! How are you? **Good.**\n\nResponse: We often ask that question out of habit and rarely out of genuine interest in the answer. It feels unnatural to say anything other than good or fine and we don't expect a different answer than that from anyone else. It's weird that we even ask when you think about it...","7698":"Seeker: Literally no friends. I don't know how to interact with other people, I don't have a single friend, and humans can't live like this. Seems like people can just smell the depression and anxiety on me and they stay away. Wish I had the courage to end it.\n\nResponse: Have you tried exploring out of your circle of people? I've had trouble making friends too but I found that when I put myself out there by taking a part time job or some sorts, I ended up meeting new people who aren't all that bad actually. As to the depression and anxiety, have you seen someone for that?","7210":"Seeker: Currently i have 60 matches on tinder and it doesnt even matter because i have nothing to offer. Texting to them would be pointless.Maybe my face is above average but i dont have any hobbies, friends so i will stay alone forever.I want to try but im dead inside.. depression sucks\n\nResponse: there are a few things I am passionate about, my bed, speed. that is about it","6846":"Seeker: Drunk and depressed. Does anyone else just feel the need to get drunk and high in their rooms alone?\n\nResponse: I just want to feel happy again. been treated like dirt by my father lately, he calls me an attention seeking snowflake. He believe in me, I begged him for mercy, but he only told me to shut up and let me cry for 2 hours straight all alone.","7620":"Seeker: Depression leading to anxiety. I know taking a walk outside would help and yet I don't want to. I know exercise or yoga it meditation or anything would help and yet I don't do it. Which leaves me anxious and frustrated too. FML.\n\nResponse: Nothing helps. depressed and anxious. The worst part is that I have a 7 day break from school. That means that all alone with my suicidal and depressive thoughts. I know what to do, wish me luck.","8796":"Seeker: I feel like I'm too mentally ill to be loved. I just feel like if someone ever wanted me they'd walk away from me because of my anxiety and depression. I feel like I'd scare them off and they'd be incapable of loving me.\n\nResponse: your illness does not make you any less deserving of love, nor any harder to love. can it make you harder to deal with? yes. and not everyone will be able to deal with it, and you can never ask anyone to. but someone who cannot deal with it is not right for you. i am one of the people who choose to deal with it, my bf is severely depressed and has anxiety. i don't love him any less for it, he was already suffering from it when i met him and i still saw right through it, saw who he was. (kind and excitable and loving) when you're suffering, first and foremost what you need is to get better. being loved, by family or friends or a partner, is part of that. having a partner is not essential, though. i can talk about this for hours if you want me to, but it's important for any relationship you have to be healthy and not turn toxic. you are not a burden, you are not unlovable. at this point in your life people who you have close relations with have to be able to understand and support you. and you deserve that, and those people exist. it can be hard to imagine, when people are depressed their life is usually not in a state where they're very connected to like-minded people. but anything can happen, and things can change. and even without change, you can encounter great things. i can tell you about my experience if you ever want.","9234":"Seeker: It's so depressing to know that I have an ADHD. Do I really need to accept the fact that I am different among others? Should I be ashamed of myself?. the title says it all\n\nResponse: Heya buddy, i can relate, After 18 years of struggling I finally found out I have dyslexia, fine motor control issues and short term memory loss. It was like I had been designed to be the perfect malfunction so I cant do academics.  I am different but I'd rather be dead then looked down upon by some other idiot who can do things I can't. I can do something better then they can, know how to go through hard times and keep pushing.  When life gets hard for them they will break, and I won't be there to help them.  Don't worry about other people, they will become dust while you will become a diamond. My question to you is, how are you going to move forward?","6533":"Seeker: I don't even keep track of the days anymore and everything just feels like a blur. Weeks absolutely fly by and I'm staggered at just how little I have done this year and overall accomplished in my life at this point. When I'm alone with my thoughts it really digs away at me. What the fuck am I meant to do on this planet?\n\nResponse: It's the same for me...I can't believe how little I've experienced. There's a part of me that wants to really live rather than just 'existing' but I don't know if I'll ever be able to let myself. I guess if you can take that step and put yourself out there, make each day mean something even if it's only small things etc, you should. But I know it's a lot easier said than done. I don't really have any advice for you, but just wanted to let you know that you're not alone. Maybe volunteering somewhere could help you if that's something that's possible for you...doing something meaningful and giving yourself purpose and all that.","8230":"Seeker: Any tips for improved self esteem?. My self esteem is honestly so low it may as well not exist. Any help on improving it would be great.\n\nResponse: When my depression was at its worst, I was lost as to what would make me feel better. I thought about what the kid version of me would think was impressive if the adult version of me actually did it. I remembered I'd always been fascinated by the seemingly impossible idea of doing a triathlon. I signed up for an Olympic distance one (way way less than an Ironman but still seemed like an almost impossible feat for me at the time) and 6 months later, I crossed the finish line. It felt good to complete and it felt good to be healthier than I'd ever been. Being fit and healthy is going to help manage depression, (\/r\/eood and \/r\/fitness are both great places) but maybe that's not your bag. Can you think of any goal that you have now (or one you can resurrect from the past) that you KNOW you'd feel great about completing?","7659":"Seeker: Exams are too stressful for me. I cannot learn anything without anxiety.\n\nResponse: Same. Been suffering for 4 years already. Can't wait to end college.","8132":"Seeker: My mother called me lazy. My mother called me lazy because it takes me too long to wake up. Is this true or not I honestly don't know.\n\nResponse: My mom does it too and I don't know if she really means it or not..It is not that uncommon anyway..","4425":"Seeker: A reason not to commit suicide for all those with sad lives. Dont do it. Death will come in the end anyways. Enjoy life even if it sucks because its a ONCE IN AN ETERNITY OPPORTUNITY to be alive. Life has a tiny chance of becoming better but only if you stick around to find out.\n\nResponse: Why post this rubbish? Are you depressed? Do you think this trite advise means anything to those who are? Enjoy life, even if you don't enjoy it! makes perfect sense.","6795":"Seeker: Shame. Anyone just feel deeply ashamed to be you? I'm really ashamed of what I am I hate everything about myself and just feel like a freakshow for everyone and everything to laugh at.\n\nResponse: Yep. Shame, guilt and regret are my primary emotions.","4929":"Seeker: Numb. I know how to find meaning in anything. I feel nothing unless high. The anti depressants work. so lost. 2 of my friends tried to ask what was wrong but it was out of pity. Why me?\n\nResponse: sorry to hear. :( is this an ongoing thing or does it come in phases? how does being high help?","6605":"Seeker: I\u2019m so lonely. Help. Please.. I know how to handle this\n\nResponse: Well, we're all here because we've been in the same place one time or another. I, myself, find it hard to believe that it gets better. But, there's always this tiny ray of hope that says just, JUST, hold on for a little longer. And since I've got nothing better to do, I obey.","3790":"Seeker: I fucking hate it here (job). I try to be nice and speak my mind. I always get rediculed or shunned. I seem to have less and less friends at work. I fucking hate it. I hate people. Of course it's probably me being too sensitive. I need to call that therapist in the new year...\n\nResponse: A therapist is never a bad idea.  Do you have the option to look for different work? How long have you been there? For myself, I need frequent change or things get stagnant and I get frustrated.","2727":"Seeker: I want to die. Please kill me.. I hate my life. I'm such a failure of a person. My life is hopeless. This world has nothing for me. I want to die. I need to die. Please someone or something please fucking kill me. Please. Please.\n\nResponse: so sorry hurting so much. here.","6658":"Seeker: Life is not worth living if there's nothing to enjoy. Fuck anyone who says otherwise\n\nResponse: Thanks, my depression is cured.","7662":"Seeker: Maybe I'm so depressed because I never leave the house or socialise, because I don't have the motivation to do that because I'm depressed. Depression is a bitch of a cycle\n\nResponse: And I'm also too scared.","6184":"Seeker: honestly what is in this world for me.. nothing thats what i feel like living to make other people happy when they only like me cause they feel sorry for me not cause they actually like me jesus i live such a sorry life.\n\nResponse: at least you got people trying to comfort you. I even dont have that. Again there are people who got it Much worse","4260":"Seeker: Suicidal. I genuinely think I won't be here much longer.\n\nResponse: Just wondering how your holding up?","9095":"Seeker: i just stay at home all of the time. have a job and I have friends in real life. I feel like making me more ill and less able to be around people.\n\nResponse: Getting a job is pretty stressful when you're feeling down. It doesn't help that sometimes finding a job, or the right job at least, is pretty stressful itself.  What I found is that volunteering is a great stepping stone on the path to getting a job and being more comfortable around people. Volunteer gigs are pretty easy to find and land, and the people who also volunteer tend to be nice people as well.  If that's something interesting to you, call up your local churches and ask about volunteering opportunities. As an added bonus, volunteering work looks good on some job applications.","9200":"Seeker: You deserve to feel okay.. You deserve to feel good.\n\nResponse: Thank you but right now I feel like I only deserve to die.","6652":"Seeker: Fuck the people who try to make you feel bad for wanting to go to the hospital for being suicidal.. I was questioned by a CPS worker by the words: do you feel about your siblings knowing that you went to the The intention was obvious and he was clearly trying to make me feel bad for choosing to go to the hospital because i was having a nervous breakdown and that i was suicidal. Even my parents tried to make me feel bad. What the hell is wrong with getting help? They just make you feel bad. Fuck family members theyre toxic asf\n\nResponse: You did the right thing. I respect that you got help to save yourself. Takes a lot of balls.  You can't choose family. I've got only my mom since 11. I don't have an uncle or aunt who hang out with me. You can choose your friends and to me friends are more important. They kinda replaced my family. And it's horribly wrong when people ask you those questions I'm so mad right now fuck man That guy has 0 empathy. I know you mad af but after you calm down try to look forward and hold onto yourself. You don't need them to save you. They should be supporting you, if not then not. Don't give a shit about them. It's a beautiful world but some people have 0 empathy. I may sound cringe but empathy is something I learned with 3 or 4. I don't know what is going wrong with some people","7173":"Seeker: How to stop caring. I'm not even sure what thread to put this on. I just need someone to tell me how to stop caring about shit that I don't need to obsess over because it's killing me. If something bothers me how do I make it stop eating away at my brain?\n\nResponse: The Power of Now literally saved my soul. I over analyzed every fucking thing and it was making me so, so miserable. I read it in a really bad period, and for the first time in a long time I felt really good again for a couple of hours. When those couple of hours came and went and I started to feel crappy again - I read the book again. It's not a big book, took about an hour and a half to read. I carried it everywhere with me for the next few weeks and whenever I could feel myself getting low, I'd read it again when I had the chance. I found over time the low moods became less and less. I also deactivated all my social media accounts while I could get my head around it all. I started buying more books on mindfulness and regularly read them. Besides understanding the present moment, it also helped me figure out my issues. Like, the root cause of my issues. As soon as I started to accept and own my feelings and the reasons I was analysing everything, it lifted a massive weight. I'm not saying it's a fix for everyone, but it sure as hell is worth a try.","7739":"Seeker: depression getting worse, anyone else have literally no fun doing ANYTHING at all? pure torture being home alone past few days. everything feels like a chore\n\nResponse: Being home alone often puts me in a really dark place. I try to stay out of the house, even if I'm still alone on my laptop at a library or a coffee shop, it feels more connected and sane. I hope you start to feel better.","6750":"Seeker: School reopens,vacations over tomorrow. I don't want to go to school.. I don't even have a friend in my class, I don't want to go to school.\n\nResponse: I hated school partly for this reason. Everyone always came back chatty and excited about what they'd done over the holidays. I had no one to tell what I'd been up to for the last few months. It was mostly just doing mundane stuff with my parents, but I still wanted to join in the conversation.","9100":"Seeker: My therapist discharged me. Lol. Not even my therapist wants me.\n\nResponse: I've struggled with abandonment issues most of my life, my fiancee left me last year, my friends and family act like I don't exist and even though I brought that up in the one counselling session I've ever had, I still got turned down for counselling. I tried going private and still got the same result. What does it say when someone with abandonment issues gets turned away by a therapist? You can't tell someone that their therapist cares about them because you care about the kids you look after.","7996":"Seeker: I'm obsolete in this world.. There's always someone who has better qualifications, better knowledge and more years of relevant experience. There's always someone who has better social skills, more charisma, and can do job interviews far better without choking. I just had the worst interview ever, completely bombing it in the most awkward way possible with the manager probably questioning whether or not I actually got a degree or was just lying by the end of it. Oh, and these interviews come by once every few months if I'm lucky. At this rate I'll have maybe one more before I become homeless.  Now I'm basically just biding my time until I run out of money and have the proper motivation to kill myself. I've given up the fight because I never stood a chance in the first place. How could I? I don't have any special qualities or skills, I'm about the least charismatic person on earth and I'm depressed as fuck. There's not a single reason for the world to care about me. I'm obsolete and in the way.\n\nResponse: This is so fucking relatable... In every aspect of my life. I know my words won't change anything, but there are others who feel the same. I hope you find your way, OP.","8564":"Seeker: Hello!. How are you all? :)\n\nResponse: Tired......I'm going to eat and then go to bed. Fuck my homework. I'll maybe do it tomorrow morning, probably not.","2333":"Seeker: No point when there is nothing.. Life is so fucking painful when you don't have anyone or anything to hold on to. When a person literally has nothing what is there to even go on for? This loneliness is going to kill me. I have nothing.\n\nResponse: Hey. I understand what you are feeling, and I am so sorry you are experiencing this. :( really such a hopeless feeling. Please feel free to PM me if you would like to talk. About anything.","3483":"Seeker: My dog has cancer. She has cancer in her nose, and over the next few months im going to watch my childhood friend struggle to breathe more and more until the end. Is this all my life is going to be, just watching things I love suffer and die? Whats the fucking point.\n\nResponse: I'm sorry to hear about your dog. Losing a pet is a tough thing to go through. Is it possible to have her euthanized? To save her some pain and you some emotional suffering? Honestly, I think that would be best, if it's at all possible. I had to watch my dog die years ago. It still haunts me because of how much she suffered and how little I was able to do to help.  *-hugs-*","6358":"Seeker: Has anyone here quit their job after a short period of time?. I'm thinking about doing that. I'm not happy at work.\n\nResponse: I quit my job recently but I've been here for a year and a half. I'm so glad I'm leaving though. This place makes me suicidal.","6888":"Seeker: Not sure which is more depressing : looking ahead in life or looking back at the past. I dont want to be old. I dont want to grow. I just want to remain a child forever. Just innocent, gullible, carefree child.\n\nResponse: the two are combined. The happy moments in the past breaking my heart while I have nothing to look forward to. No hope no prospects.","8860":"Seeker: I feel like i have just wasted 20 years of my life.. Happy birthday to me i guess...\n\nResponse: It's your birthday? Well, happy birthday...  And I can relate. I'm pushing 30 and I feel like I have wasted what were supposed to be the best years of my life...","7896":"Seeker: I miss my best friend. I want to be close to somebody\n\nResponse: Me too. I try to establish a connection, they just stop talking eventually","8926":"Seeker: Visiting hometown feeling sad as hell. Been here for a month now and i just feel empty i need help\n\nResponse: Could you tell us more? visiting my hometown too and I kind of have an... uneasy feeling with it too. Feels like I achieved anything since I left home and is still the same weak and shy little guy. But at the same time I also grew estranged with my hometown and my friends and family over here. Idk if that even made any sense but hey have an internet hug buddy the least I could do","5789":"Seeker: The key to a happy life is ignorance. The world is a bad place and if you tune out the news, your money issues, and the world issues, then you can live a happier life\n\nResponse: That may be the case but seems like practicing stoicism is also option to have a supposed happy life  I know about you but for me to realized that every little thing that I worry about is just so small to the rest of the world that I help myself but to chuckle I expect anything good to happen to me from now on and all these minor inconviences will eventually end at some point So why bother worrying about it?","6854":"Seeker: Have any of you looked in a mirror,. and hated what you saw?\n\nResponse: Literally everyone has. This isn't some unique depression thing that isolates you like a lot of things about depression. Everyone has something about them they don't like, most people don't like what they see in the mirror, and still a lot fucking despise what they see.","6853":"Seeker: Does it ever get better?. It's like two steps forward, ten steps back. It's exhausting.\n\nResponse: So far it hasn't gotten better for me, I've just come to accept it. Things that when I was younger would've made me cry or get really mad now just miff me. For example today I found out that I got ripped off over $130 because of an irrevocable clerical error - that's about 1\/3rd of what I make in a week, and I should be furious because this kind of thing happens far too often. But what good will that do me?","1924":"Seeker: How do you guys keep going when it feels like you're 6 feet below rock bottom.. Edit: no thanks for the help guys\n\nResponse: Sorry this is over a month old but I do hope you are feeling better. The thing about bottom is, there is only one other place to go. Talking things out with someone often puts things into perspective but even the act of just getting things off your chest usually helps. Let me know if you want to chat, I will listen.","8343":"Seeker: Question for people suffering. Does depression make you angry?. Do you lash out at people and call them names? Do you have episodes of rage and are you aware of your actions during them? How can I help someone who says they have depression but is not diagnosed?\n\nResponse: I do. I push people away, am very irritable out of nowhere even if someone says a certain word of phrase. I'm pretty shitty actually, but I can't stop :(","9150":"Seeker: Attachment problems. I'm so sick of myself putting loads of energy into people and then they just push me to the side and forget me. But it's my problem because I get too attached but it just hurts so much\n\nResponse: I used to feel like that too. Now I've understood that acquaintances and friends can be won and lost overtime. You make friends, you lose some, you keep in touch with others.  Don't expect anything from them; instead focus on the quality moments you have with them that make you happy.","5319":"Seeker: I just really really want to die. I see no point anymore all people do is bother me\n\nResponse: in what way do people bother you. Like they personally go out of their way or you mean like everyone including random people annoy you?","6861":"Seeker: im in a contsant cycle of going from''i want to improve myself'' to ''fuck life i just want to sit home be miserable and do nothing''. i hope im not the only one feeling this way\n\nResponse: You arent. I can only speak for myself here but I sometimes get stable enough to motivate myself to lessen my consume of electronics and be productive instead and read, tidy up and continue learning the language ive been working on. However those ups usually dont last long cause its easy to trigger me into collapsing again. The only way out is gettin a potent therapist or the right pills I guess","6995":"Seeker: I like to sit outside in the rain because I feel as if everyone else in the world is crying with me.. Anyone else feel this way? One comment\/upvote and I'll feel some sense of comfort. Thank you\n\nResponse: I like the rain because it feels cleansing, like it could wash everything away so that we can start fresh. It's oddly uplifting.","3887":"Seeker: She always chooses work over me. And then claims I'm still important\n\nResponse: I assume that you don't agree that you're important. Are you overlooking things in the relationship that show that you actually are?","8560":"Seeker: I like my drunk self better. I'mn so much more spontaneous and willing to sacrifice perfection to just have fun when I'm drunk. Is anyone else like that?\n\nResponse: I am. It's hard to be sober, because I don't feel like the fun joyful person I am when I'm drunk. When I'm not drunk I'm depressed and anxious and in pain and I hate it. And I'm sorry that you're feeling like this :( I'm here for ya","5254":"Seeker: I'm at the emptiness stage. I'm a mindless robot drifting through life doing what I have to do\n\nResponse: How is in your head? I mean... what thoughts go through it? I wonder if Im alone in this but..m my mins doesnt wander anymore. Im aware of every single thought, which is never pleasant nor spontaneous\/creative. :\/","1554":"Seeker: We'd be 15 today. I miss my wife, terribly. That is all.\n\nResponse: so sorry my friend. I hope found something or someone to help you fill a part of that void.","5175":"Seeker: im so sad and i have no idea why. fuck this, fuck life, fuck everything\n\nResponse: Something's not right up there. Have you seek treatment?","8654":"Seeker: Going Bananas. Does anyone ever feel like they get near the precipice of a psychotic break and just barely pull yourself away from the edge?~Askingforafriend\n\nResponse: Nope. I fell completely over the edge three times. But I'm feeling much better now.","8941":"Seeker: I deserve to die alone.. That way I don't drag anyone else down with me.\n\nResponse: No one deserves to be alone. You sound like you're going through a hard time. I am, too, but lately I've been feeling more confident and hopeful. What's bothering you? You seen like you might think you'll be alone forever.","6189":"Seeker: Why does death make people sad?. a relief from the hell known as life\n\nResponse: I don't really think life is he'll but I don't understand the weird sadness or fear of death that people have. I've known a few people who died. I wasn't sad at all. Everyone I know is going to die and one day I am going to die. Why is that sad?","8503":"Seeker: I want to give up.. So very badly. I've ruined everything good in my life. I can't take this pain anymore. I want it to stop. I want to be dead. This is too much. I can't undo my stupidity and now I'm fucked. I can't do this.\n\nResponse: I have been at a similar point to you where I had suicidal ideations on a daily basis and to be honest, even when aspects in my life have improved, I still struggle with it frequently. I have done many things in life I regret and feel like I've fucked up a lot of situations, relationships and opportunities in both my personal and professional life. It took me a long time to understand that I can't go back in time and fix anything. It is fucking terrifying to feel like you've messed your life up but please trust me when I say that it's ok to fuck up. You are human. We all are. I have found that being alone with my thoughts was a big factor in triggering urges to harm myself or get stuck in my thought loops about how useless or worthless I am. If you have someone you trust to talk to, please dont be afraid to rant or reach out to them. My inbox is always open too if you need a stranger to listen. You're not alone in this.","3501":"Seeker: Just cut myself for the first time. I've been drinking and i don't know how I feel\n\nResponse: Ok, how deeply did you cut yourself and with what? If it is bleeding a lot, clean it up, run it under water, don't let the blood dry and go nasty. Pat it dry. Bandage it up, if you can. Also if you have some antiseptic cream, use some of that on it. Don't drink any more for now, maybe try and get some sleep or have a nice bath or shower or watch tv or something so you can calm down.  Please see a professional- a doctor or a therapist or something. Self harm is very serious. I have been doing it for many years, and it is a difficult addiction to break out of. If you feel the urge to cut again, take a deep breath, count to 10. Write your feelings down or draw them out, even if you don't think you're a great artist or whatever. It will help to get the emotions out. Do you have a good friend you can talk to about it? Or a pet or even a stuffed toy? Talking helps. I'm sorry you're feeling this way. Please let me know if you want to talk. You are a strong person &lt;3","7787":"Seeker: I was just going to sleep.... ...Now I'm here crying because of a dream that I have every fucking other night that involves my head and a shotgun.  I'm fucking tired of this dream, man... I wish it'd stop.\n\nResponse: Talk to your doc about Seroquel. I got it for falling asleep but it did wonders for my dreams. Then again I usually have decent dreams to begin with.","8481":"Seeker: Is psychiatry a good idea?. Currently in a bad spot, not a great way to correct it normally without getting into a worse one. Normally, I'm against drugs for treating mental disorders but it seems like a quick way out right now if it helps. So basically, does it work for anyone?\n\nResponse: Psychiatry and\/or psychology can be a big help. Psychologists, at least in Illinois, can't prescribe, so their first choice may not be drug therapy.","4916":"Seeker: My fiancee is writing a suicide note. And i dont know what to do about it.\n\nResponse: Have you tried telling them to get help, therapist, medication, or hospital. You could always call the suicide hotline. I called them when my friend was about to kill herself and it was very helpful.","3751":"Seeker: Too short to join the army, too small for clothes, too awkward for jobs, too ugly for a girlfriend.. Too bad so sad, that's what I tell myself.\n\nResponse: How tall are you dude?","7130":"Seeker: In order to improve my life, i have to face my responsibilities. Every time i try to face my responsibilities, i freak out and my life ends up getting worse. someone take me off this ride\n\nResponse: I hate that I usually succumb to the crippling overwhelm that often accompanies me trying to deal with the seemingly insurmountable [logistically, tangible, financial, and medical] things I must deal with...... as the clock ticks.....","619":"Seeker: I have nothing to live for. I have no hope. I have no motivation. I have a job. tired of feeling depressed. I want to give up.\n\nResponse: Hey sorry things are blank for you just hold in there and try to find something unique about yourself or make something and give it a purpose in your life. motivation have to come from inside yourself alone it can be other places or times","8598":"Seeker: Anyone else completely useless to society?. I can't get myself to get a job. I dropped out of classes last semester. I do nothing all day but sleep, eat, and smoke pot.\n\nResponse: I feel the exact same way. My ex girl friend broke up with me and got pregnant with another guy . Words can't describe what I went through. Atleast your not buying hard drugs right ? If you are I'm not judging you.","5662":"Seeker: How do I stop overthinking things?. Essentially what the title says.

A lot of my mates that I know in real life that are also having a hard time mainly attribute it to lack of affection or love, be it from parents, a spouse they've had a falling out with, someone who left their love unrequited, you get what I mean. I myself had lost many people who meant the world to me, most of it due to me simply not being as important to them as they are to me. It's definitely taken a huge toll on me, but it's not the only reason why I suffer today. I wonder sometimes because of this, perchance I get the love that I crave from the people that I cherish, would things be different? Would I be fixed? I personally doubt that I would be fixed. So many things have happened that I feel like I simply cannot be a normal person anymore who can genuinely feel pure, innocent happiness.

Im going to die alone yay. I am unlovable.\n\nResponse: Last year I started dating the love of my life without a single doubt in my mind. My depression resurfaced tho and I started to push her away right into another man's dick. The worst part is that you can't exactly warn them about how you're really feeling and the reason why you're pushing them away because it's hard for them to understand, potentially making everything way more complicated. I don't know enough about you but I know that my heart is fragile so I put up a wall around me to protect it. But sometimes i open up a hole in the wall and it can be pretty darned beautiful.. or disappointing. Luck, maybe?","5257":"Seeker: How do you reach out to someone without feeling guilty or ashamed?.

Why am I such a sad person? I don't know.. why.\n\nResponse: Don't try to make sense out of something which isn't logical, depression never makes sense, which is why it's hard to treat. Have you spoken to a medical professional about it?","6284":"Seeker: Holy hell why cant I sleep?!. I just started taking Zoloft a few days ago and since then I can not fucking fall asleep. I'm not an idiot I know it's a side effect but shit this is annoying. I have school in the morning\n\nResponse: been taking Zoloft for a few days and it made me more sleepy then ever.

My answer was exactly what he would expect I get all the stuff, stuff done and catch up with friends that kind of with a big smile plastered on my face. Just a simple interaction between two friendly colleagues. Inside my answer was very different it said in a dull voice\n\nResponse: This is exactly what I do whenever someone asks something like do you like to How am I supposed to answer that?

Why is my brain always going going going? It's like having a radio turned on full volume in my head 24 hours a day. And now that I've been taking sertraline I have vivid nightmares, too, so sleeping doesn't offer me any peace. I'm so tired\n\nResponse: I share your thoughts. My therapist suggested that the reason why I could be so thin is because my body burns so much energy in my brain because it is constantly going around around.

Love to hear people personal stories on the topic.\n\nResponse: I've smoked pot about 7 times or so. First time freaked me out, made me a little paranoid. I kept trying it in small doses and never really made me feel nice, just kinda paranoid. The very last time I took it I was with 2 friends and I took like 1 big-ish hit and became paranoid, again. Unfortunately, I spent that night freaking out over my heart racing and thinking I was going to have a heart attack. This ended up developing into chronic heart anxiety. This was about 4 or so years ago and now I live with extremely, extremely bad anxiety. I thought it'd be nice using it as an escape for my depression back then but never made me feel nice, alcohol did weirdly. I would love to try weed again in a different environment to see if it would help with my depression\/anxiety. I hate taking heavy meds, I would much rather use weed.","8499":"Seeker: I dreamt that someone shot me in the head. I wish that dream would come true\n\nResponse: I dreamt that too. When I started to die, everything started slowly fading and falling away. The more dead I became, the more I woke up. It was like I was aware that I was in a deep dreamless sleep when I was dead. Then I was awake in shock. More surprising than scary. Life is like a dream now.","8939":"Seeker: As a therapist, I became the patient. Exactly a year ago I treated a patient with depression, always in bed with a smelly dark room, no hope.  Now I became that patient myself, and although I can relate to him now, I fucking hate my joke for a life.\n\nResponse: Yeah I'm working a PSW job and it pains me to see these people who are forced to or even worse don't have anything to do but lay in bed. You see the effects of social isolation and the lack of control. I work with a person with ABI and as much he tries to stay positive, the frustration seeps out of him all the time. The little things we take for granted like going to the bank, buying groceries, picking up prescriptions become so regulated and standardized in their lives, that you can't expect any other reaction but frustration. It's affected my personal life with my relatives because I get so angry thinking about how there is no way to make them better and I lash out for the littlest reasons on them. I understand it's all about perspective but in the already depressed state I'm in, I know I'm not cut out to help other people feel better.

I love my bf more than anything.. but my family issues and a big issue with a dog of mine is causing him to be depressed and not enjoy his life the way he should be... he tells me this... I solved the family issue.. but the only way to solve to dog issue involves me putting him down.. and I cant do it.. I just cant.

Sometimes I feel like there's no point of living anymore.\n\nResponse: I don't think I've failed that much but that's because I rarely have the power to try anything in the first place. I have no idea where I'm going. I know where I want to, but it takes so much effort to get there and I don't know if I'll have that ability time soon.  What happened that brought you to this point?","7027":"Seeker: What's the general age here\/are there any parents here?. I'm 25, I'm hoping there's people around my age. I'm also a mother to a special needs child. If there are any parents here, how do you cope with the apathy? Thanks, I'm new to Reddit btw\n\nResponse: Thirty-three but no kids.

I feel like life isnt worth living, it just keeps on getting worse, i hate everything i just wish suicide was easy.\n\nResponse: I agree with what you're saying.

I don't even know who I am anymore--just who I am not.

I remember when I used to be so happy and full of life. Now I just feel doubtful, uncertain, and unconfident. Low self-esteem seems to be my best friend.\n\nResponse: Yes, it's because I was unprepared for the job market and just studied and graduated because it was the normal thing to do. I also lost all my marks in a very short time and had personal issues to solve caused by my own bad decisions. I did not make enough place for other important aspects of life during my studies. It was a big mental struggle to realize that but I am slowly getting back on tracks.","1380":"Seeker: Anyone else fantasize about being an old person?. You don't have to wake up and worry about shit, you probably have a disease that makes you unable to perform certain tasks, and your shitty personality aligns perfectly with that of an old man's\n\nResponse: I thought so until I came to realized that your health department is seriously lacking. Getting a pension would be really nice, if you have that in your country, but it's usually quite low. But beside that, the health is too damn hard. Of course you got 70 years old being president or running marathon and all. But I've seen people around me and it's just a blend of being tired, in pain, and or being slow, clumsy, close to handicap doing basic things. It scares me, especially with all the diseases that my relatives have or had, and the fact that I don't take care of my body as well as I could\/should... Sorry if this is triggering anything in anyone, or a bit despairing. One upside is that science is doing wonders, so in your life time you could survive more shit, being treated better, and I believe our generation is going to react to the way we take care of the elderly in general. DO NOT LOSE HOPE... but the grass is always greener...","722":"Seeker: People say stay strong, but it's not about strength, it's about endurance, and endurance always eventually runs out. Strength is for short bursts, endurance is for running races.\n\nResponse: Great way of putting it. Life is just so exhausting. I can't leave the house without caffeine, I have no interests, I just feel like an empty battery. Hopefully one day you can find both strength and endurance.","744":"Seeker: In a dark place. I feel at war with my own mind. I feel like my cause of death will eventually be suicide no matter what. I just don't think I can handle this. I hate myself.\n\nResponse: I've been here. I know it's hard to see past the dark clouds now and I know it's cheesy but it DOES get better. I've been in and out of psych wards for suicide attempts my entire life. Where I am now, what I've worked towards, has made everything I've gone through worth it. I am so glad I failed.  There is more to experience in this life than you could imagine and most difficult things are temporary and will pass. Hang in there. Work on yourself. Do the things that make you happy, make you feel something, as long as they aren't harmful. Spend time with your family, your friends or animals. Maybe with yourself or nature.

Yeah.I feel useless and like a burden for my family.What good I am for if I can't keep a simple job in a chocolate factory? &gt;What do you do during a day if not at work? Read self improvement articles,watch porn and masturbate,and clean my house. My advice for you you find yourself jobless is: # Do not waste your time. Do not lock yourself in your room and watch porn&amp;masturbate all long.Find something useful to do with your free time.Recharge your batteries.Start working out,you don't need to go to gym,just take a run in the morning and one in the evening.Build your emotional resilience.I do this by reading about it first (I am in the process of finding out what it means and then I have to apply it).A good start is r\/Stoicism.Make yourself useful - clean your house and take care of your pets. After that start looking for another job and do not despair.","433":"Seeker: I just want someone to ask me how I'm doing without me provoking the question.. That's it, that's all I have to say.\n\nResponse: Me as well. Most of the time when its asked they just expect a good or a fine but if you are genuine they just seem uncomfortable... I would ask how you are doing, but it was provoked by this post lol. If you still feel the need to talk, I'm here :P","7":"Seeker: I called in sick to work today. For the first time in a couple months I was feeling so Shitty I called into both my jobs today. Just feeling too burnt out, but I slept a lot, read quite a bit and finally managed to shower so the day a complete waste\n\nResponse: Is that really so bad? Maybe it was the smart decision because you needed that time to read recover. You're being kind to yourself when you need it and that's important.

The most important thing is doing what you love.","1364":"Seeker: A close friend came up to me and told me that he's depressed and he has no idea why.. I want to help him but I don't know how. Of course, I've been searching the internet for anything that could help but I think first-hand advice from people who have gone\/are going through depression or have been in the same situation as me would be very valuable.\n\nResponse: Tell him to get some professional help, do your best to offer support but regardless of your relationship with them it is not your job to heal them. They can only do that for themselves, and that's something he will have to choose for himself. Start making appointments with well rated professionals now, it often takes time to schedule them. Good luck to you and your friend.","849":"Seeker: I just found out she was cheating on me.. I feel numb. I want to die.\n\nResponse: Eff that thing, let's go for a beer and let her know she means nothing to you now. Passive aggressive may not be the best, but I had a friend who did the same for me when I found out I was cheated on. He took me out to a bar, shot the shit with me and it really helped connecting with someone who cared enough to be there for me, I hope you've the same friends (if it fits your life style).

I'm having a lot difficulty with this.\n\nResponse: I swear, if people didn't have families, there would be a lot less depression in this world.  I guess it really depends on the type of family stress. Can you realistically put some distance between yourself and the stress? Or is it something that you have to resolve?","1644":"Seeker: I\u2019m Pregnant And Alone ... &amp; I have no reasons to live.. and sorry.\n\nResponse: It gets better.... hang in","1151":"Seeker: I Tried.

Anyone can relate ?\n\nResponse: I can relate to some degree. You've got it right though, perfection does not exist. There are people with it better and people with it worse. It's a very destructive thing to think about yourself negatively. Try thinking about the things you do well for a change.","1331":"Seeker: Self-harm. Nothing brings me more peace than cutting myself.

He's my best friend and we have been through hell together. I am a mess. I don't know what to do. I am in school right now and I feel no motivation. I can't sleep, I can't eat, and I can't breathe. I went to a counselor today but it didn't help much. I feel so lost, and I dont know what to do. I'm so lonely, my friends haven't been much help. We have mutual friends and I feel like I am losing them. I am so lost. I already have health problems and this is just killing me.\n\nResponse: My boyfriend and i officially broke up yesterday. The pain you are feeling is not foolish nor is it you being weak. When we tend to get into relationships we often more time than not replace friendships with our partners. And as time progresses the person is not just simply a partner but a friend whom is apart of the very foundation our life is build upon. I am not sure why you two broke up. And i know it hurts extremely bad, and life has lost much of its meaning. I will it try to come up with some lighthearted crap that tells you everything is going to disappear quickly. This will be tough, this will hurt, and at times it will feel like nothing at all is worth living for. But i must tell you this feeling is temporary..... it will not last forever. How long it will last i cannot say, when it will end i cannot say either. But take it one day at a time. Do things that are only necessary for your existence. And those that are extra if you are not up to it do it. Within the relationship i am sure there were flaws on both parts, beat yourself up about them. When the time is right started to fix those things. And if in months or weeks time you feel like you want to reach out to see if anything can be rekindled do so. But you as a person have to stand alone so if or when this may happen it will not shake your entire life. Become strong from this.","2968":"Seeker: Day off and I have nothing to do.

Art has been my obsession all of my life but i'm so bad at it because i'm an idiot. a cognitively deficient fuck up is what i am\n\nResponse: Nah man, What you're saying is actually quite common of someone who is good at art. Most people with a high degree or artistic talent are really good at *recognizing* good art, but get frustrated because their own art doesn't live up to the crazy high standard they've set for themselves. Malcom Gladwell suggests that it takes 10,000 hours to gain mastery in something. Art is a skill just like anything else. I think a lot of people get fooled into this You either have it or you don't mentality when it comes to creative arts. It's just not the case. I think it's more important that you actually have an obsession and something that you want to be good at! Most people don't have that. Just keep practicing and never give up. If you have the drive you will succeed eventually. You'll get better and better every day.","3031":"Seeker: I guess I can never drink.

I know I'm just a stranger on the internet, but I'm here if you need to talk.","366":"Seeker: I feel sick, sad and alone.. my lungs aren't doing well today. my husband works 9am to 9pm so i am alone today. i want to disappear into my story and hide there. i want to be in that other world where i am happy. i feel like a bother to people.\n\nResponse: I may just be a random stranger in the internet but you are definitely not a bother. And, how are your lungs?","898":"Seeker: Feeling more alone than ever - gave up everything to move for someone, long story fast forward to completely alone in a foreign country and no going back..

You can PM me if you want","1663":"Seeker: I was giving a presentation in class today and i just couldnt handle it so i just grabbed my things and walked out..

I'm on a long streak of feeling great, it started after I cleaned my house to a ocd degree.

Not happy. Just numb.\n\nResponse: Yeah also feel numb often. Wanna talk about it?","2825":"Seeker: why do i constantly cry for help and turn it down when i ACTUALLY get help. i feel like such an attention whore\n\nResponse: When I felt this way, I came to the conclusion that I didn't know who I was without these feelings. I didn't know what I liked anymore, would I be empty without this sadness? That sort of thought process, it was a lot of fear that drove me away from help. It's natural to be afraid of things changing. But when you feel ready to, these changes are for the better.","2573":"Seeker: Just losing all hope in life and people.. Everything seems to be going wrong. politics, environment and my faith in humanity. Nothing seems worth it\n\nResponse: Ugh, you are absolutely right; the world and humans are a mess. This might not make you feel better but it has always been a mess. It actually isn't really much worse than it has always been. I read a certain amount of history and have come to realize this. Even if you just read the Old Testament you can see how crappy people were. One thing that helps me is to stay away from news. I don't think it makes us informed if all we know is the bad stuff. Also try subscribing and reading Uplifting News on a regular basis. Made Me Smile is also a good. Finally to really get informed about the good stuff going on in the world, volunteer. I prefer Habitate for Humanity; you meet people from all walks of life doing what little they can to help others. This doesn't make the news very often but is happening everyday.","9118":"Seeker: Anyone else feel unlovable. All i want is hugs or to cuddle with someone just to be physically\/emotionally close with someone. Not just to get fucked and thrown away.\n\nResponse: I kind of agree with you but doing all that requires an actual effort and energy. Sometimes I'm just happy to get through the day. It's a vicious cycle of being unhappy with yourself and having zero motivation to change something.","2879":"Seeker: Sorry, but I absolutely hate myself. Just needed to express this, to someone. Loneliness, you know?\n\nResponse: I know the feel, I just know why","410":"Seeker: .. I feel that I belong in this world I feel that my existence is a mistake.\n\nResponse: hard to see our impact on society from a single moment in our lives.

Your life matters a lot.","2274":"Seeker: i did something horrible. when i was 18-21 i misled a older woman with marriage and kids for 3 years. i knew it was wrong since i have mentall issues. she is 30 now and desperate for kids\/marriage i feel it is my fault that she have those and it makes me depressed\n\nResponse: Yeah pretty fucking horrible but not unforgivable. But your mental illness is no excuse. We are obligated to do our best every day to be good people, just like everyone else. THAT BEING SAID, what would you tell someone else who posted this? Hopefully that not the only person to make this mistake, and making mistakes make you a bad guy. The fact that you feel remorse shows that you have empathy and care about others.","264":"Seeker: Tomorrow I turn 22 years old but today I woke up with suicidal thoughts..

Even something like a typo, or an accidental arithmetical error.\n\nResponse: I hear you on that. I make a mistake at work and I feel like I deserve physical pain. :\/ I know intellectually it's not true, and it's easy for me to say you don't deserve pain for small human mistakes like everyone makes, but believing it in my subconscious is harder.","283":"Seeker: Just need some support!. not feeling well at all. stuck in this place I want to be in, I get out of here because mandatory.

Just feeling too burnt out, but I slept a lot, read quite a bit and finally managed to shower so the day a complete waste\n\nResponse: Is that really so bad?

So, you have to learn to appreciate yourself","1181":"Seeker: There is no help.. You are on your own.\n\nResponse: You are on your own, which gives you the power to turn it around! You are not your mistakes, your past, your parents, your bully. You are a person doing the best they know how! You can ask for help, but it is up to you to accept it. Loving yourself is difficult and getting to that point is painful","4413":"Seeker: I don\u2019t give a shit about being happy. I just want to fucking die\n\nResponse: Do you care about excitement at all or no?","1420":"Seeker: Remembering why I usually try to shut out my emotions. Feeling anything is painful now. Anger makes me a ranting asshole, happiness makes me a grinning idiot, sadness just leaves me lying in my room for hours, and passion makes me exhausted. Plus, when I'm happy, I know it's going to be that much worse when I inevitably come down.\n\nResponse: Its a bummer, I know exactly how you're feeling. I usually try not not feel too much of anything. I brush off happiness with the knowledge that whatever good happened is a rarity I shouldn't get used to or acknowledge. Sadness is can always be treated with a few stiff drinks or an exhausting run. That kind of thinking makes me pretty numb but I'm okay with it, until I find a consistent source of happiness.","1407":"Seeker: Feeling really bad.. Feel like a human punching bag, everyone just picks on me and i just laugh it off even people that hardly know me. I honestly don't feel like there's anyone in my life I can trust, I have no one.\n\nResponse: Often times people take laughter as a cue that what doing is okay.

I just have no interest in living, doing anything for myself... I know that I should set some goals that accomplish something positive for myself but... I just can't... I can't think of anything I want to do...\n\nResponse: Here is a goal: get out of bed. I'm sure you are familiar with that crushing feeling where you just cant move because your depression is so fucking heavy. Just move a little bit. None is expecting you to be the fastest person in the race, we just want you to keep moving forward with us. A good goal is something achievable. On my broken days, my goals are to get up, take a shower, make a bowl of cereal. I'm a bit luckier than most, I have a wonderful wife and child, and they help me out when it comes to keeping myself moving forward. Just tiny things should be your goal. Eat an apple. Stretch. Take a shower, fuck, take a bath. Dont try to solve world hunger, just do what is possible for you.

I got my hopes up... what a joke I am.\n\nResponse: it's just one of those normal things in life, we'll keep on trying and we'll keep on failing. The reason success feels good is because you work for it. Don't let disappointment get to you, look at it this way, being disappointment means you know you could've done better.

I dont know what you are going through, but whatever it is, is it really THAT bad you feel the need to end your life?? Now just think about what all your friends and family will think once you are gone... they will be blaming themselves forever because they will feel like they are at fault because they didnt help you when you needed it most.

I'm at the point in my depression spectrum where everything makes me angry. All day I experience silent rage. Things piss me off more than they did before. And this is the way i isolate myself without knowing it at times. My family tells me they don't know who I am anymore, they ask why I'm mad all the time. My partner does not get fair treatment from how shitty I treat him. My whole life is that feeling you get when your mom tells you to take out the garbage right before you're about to go sleep. Little inconvenience after little inconvenience turns into full on discomfort being awake and always being pissed off you have to do anything at all. I don't know how to not be mad anymore and it scares me.\n\nResponse: I feel the same way. I'm angry and depressed. It takes a lot out of me emotionally to do little things like run errands. I hate interacting with people. They state at me funny and act like I'm scary which makes me angry. It's exhausting.","2876":"Seeker: Jack of no trades, Master of nothing.

Can anyone relate? I feel pretty fine during the day, probably because I'm occupied doing stuff but in the evening I get really sad, like really sad and I also feel trapped and lonely...\n\nResponse: Absolutely. Self doubt, drifting thoughts, bleak view of the future, and a tsunami of regret floods my mind regularly every evening. Then I retreat to the Internet which keeps me up all night. It's a little out there, but I've had incredible relief from my insomnia, depression, and chronic pain using an Aerial Yoga Hammock. I hang it from the ceiling right next to my bed\/computer desk and usually just cacoon in it for an hour or so. Feeling weightless and swaying back and forth has an incredibly natural calming effect on the mind. They are only $60 on amazon too. Feel better my friend, you are not alone.","1740":"Seeker: When can I stop?. There's nothing keeping me here anymore. I live alone. Mom's been dead for years, dad and siblings are basically estranged. No spouse, no kids. There's no one. I don't have any reason to keep going and I'm so tired. When is it ok to just end it? I feel like there's nothing left for me here.\n\nResponse: For at least the last 4 or 5 years I've also felt like there's not really any point in living, and yet.... I'm still here. If only to spite all the people who think you aren't strong enough to make it, There's always a reason to hang on :) you matter and you deserve good things.","2315":"Seeker: WHat the fuck is wrong with me?. WHy do I always do this to myself? Why do I let it keep happening? Ugh.\n\nResponse: Yeah, we're creatures of habit unfortunately. I also find myself falling into the same pits over and over again but yknow what? Sometimes life just clicks together and all the pieces fit into the big picture and you find that moment where you can change. It doesn't have to be overnight, but look for some baby steps that can put your forward. best of luck x","2801":"Seeker: What is it like to seek help as a minor. 14 years old and am depressed and have issues with anxiety and self harm. If i tried to seek help with a doctor what process would I go through and what would most likely happen. in the U.S. if it makes a difference\n\nResponse: it *probably* depends on the state (edit: what state in the US). being 14, you are going to be tethered to your parent\/guardian legally. the therapist\/counselor\/psychologist will be legally required to tell your guardians of anything that serves of specific risk. for example, i told my therapist that i was suicidal and he had to contact my mother and explain the basics of the situation. for self harm, im not sure exactly how\/if the information would be disclosed by the therapist\/counselor\/psychologist to your parents.. but im assuming if you are physically hurting yourself to a GREAT EXTENT then yes, it would most likely be disclosed. im 18 now, and started seeing my on-campus(university) therapist and psychiatrist at the beginning of the school year, where i was 17. it sucks not being in control of your life, but what can you do, you know? if getting to see a therapist is an issue, i would recommend asking to talk to your doctor\/pediatrician in private (during a normal check-up) and say tht youve had symptoms of depression\/anxiety and you'd like to have some help talking to your parent about getting help. if it's not an issue of talking to your parent\/guardian, then what's the worry? if you cant see a doctor, a school counselor could help you have this conversation with your parent! or even a supportive teacher that you trust. i went through a very similar situation when i was younger, and very much regret not being more persistent about getting help when i needed it. it mght not go away, and with school only getting harder and more stressful as you age, it's *really hard* to deal with all this emotional baggage. everyone deserves to feel the best that they can. you dont want to suffer anymore and someday you wont! feel free to pm me, i'd be happy to be your pen-pal through all this &lt;3","2373":"Seeker: i dont feel worthy enough to live!?. i literally dont see anything special in me and im a dissapointment. how can i stop feeling this way?\n\nResponse: I often feel the same, but many people don't find their life's purpose until later on in life. Either way the only person whose opinion matters is you, so don't let anyone tell you different. Everyone is unique and doesn't live the same life or the same way! As for how to stop feeling that way, it really depends. Maybe talking about the reasons you feel that way would help? Perhaps trying to try new things and find that thing that makes you feel important, proud, happy, successful, etc. could help. Regardless I hope you are able to see the part of you that is already there that is special OP.

What's up friendo?","2265":"Seeker: I love\/hate how my depression always lifts when drunk. It's so frustrating. I can see so clearly when drunk, I actually feel like working on my problems, I'm just so happy overall. Then I sober up and it's the same suicidal bullshit again.

Would you like to quit drinking?","1469":"Seeker: Got called inmature for having suicidal thoughts.. I guess that's what I get for telling people how i feel.\n\nResponse: It's not immature to have suicidal thoughts but it is, however, unfair that you were judged for it. Some people just don't understand how something feels until they experience it themselves. I was always told that my suicidal tendencies were not only annoying, but they were also bullshit. It took me a while to accept that it's not wrong to reach out and want someone to care and help you.","4118":"Seeker: I'm a fucking idiot.. Just a stupid pathetic fucking idiot.\n\nResponse: What went so wrong that you think that?","1231":"Seeker: Is it bad that I feel worse when I'm not depressed?. I feel like I don't deserve to feel better...\n\nResponse: This is a normal feeling. I've felt this. I don't have much constructive to say except that it is something that is completely okay to feel, and the feeling will fade as you feel better more often.","8730":"Seeker: Been in bed all day today.

I got out of my bed, picked up my books (to study), my pc, but then just went to another bed I have at home. :\/","3049":"Seeker: one question. I'll keep it simple. Can there be happiness in despair? Because I think I felt it and I want to kill off any hope that's left for me.\n\nResponse: That's a pretty profound question, but I think happiness is something that a lot of people don't understand. In a period or prolonged period of despair, I don't believe there can be happiness at all, and it's only after that period has been solved, over, attacked enough by effort and time, that you can start experiencing happiness. I don't think happiness and gratitude should be forced, or you should try to feel happy when you truly cannot feel happy. I'm still going through that period, and there might be rivets or jewels of happiness along the way, but they are fleeting and leave very quickly. The whole reason why people despair is because they are tied so strongly to negative emotional memories that they outweigh any trivial positive emotional memories. Think about it, which memories are the quickest, strongest, and most easily able to be remembered for you? The most emotional ones. If your most emotional memories are negative, you will be in despair. On the converse, if one's most emotional memories are positive, you will be in a state of happiness. There is a way to end your despair, you just have to face it head on and let go of everything, and keep trying to let go and accept. Very few people have any science on this and might be the thing we need to explore the most as a society as a whole.","661":"Seeker: Should you kill yourself if you have no social life?. Should you kill yourself if you have no social life?\n\nResponse: No. Not having a social life isn't a terminal diagnosis. Why kill yourself due to lack of social life if you could eventually obtain one? Life is not pass\/fail. It's not about getting a certain grade for social life, or any other aspect of life for that matter. You are not a failure. Not having friends worsens depression, depression inhibits the ability to make friends. It's a cycle that needs to be broken, and I recommend getting medical help to tackle depression. Eventually you will get to a point where it is easier to make\/maintain relationships, even if it that progress seems small at first. Keep up the fight.","1891":"Seeker: So tonight i'm going to tell a friend i got depression. And I'm so scared actually, I wanna to let at least one person know that I got depression but I'm really scared about his reaction and what he would think. How did you guys explained it to ur friend(s) ?\n\nResponse: What is it about telling a friend about your struggles with depression that makes you feel like they will react adversely? If they are a trusted friend, they will care and listen to you and be supportive of you. The benefits to discussing this with a trusted friend is they can help you get the help you need and be there for you in the ups and downs. Everyone has had depression, just for some it can be more severe, longer, and more disruptive to one's life. Try to get them to relate by asking about their moments of depression. A good way to discuss this with them is in a quiet place over coffee or food. All the best to you.","1682":"Seeker: Cancelled all plans for tomorrow because depression got the best of me..

I think that feeling forces me to be depressed again.\n\nResponse: I can't remember the last time I was happy, seriously. But I think I understand you. You are so used to being depressed like it's your normal state of being? And then you can feel this tiny bit of happiness and it feels strange, like you don't deserve it? I think you do deserve it.","1585":"Seeker: so my boss called me an idiot today.. that was fun. totally not crying right now. it's fine.\n\nResponse: Oh... if a boss did that to me, I'd debate the heck out of him and put a mirror against him to make him understand his flaw\/s (unless feelings of job loss risks arise) No boss is going to get away with putting his workers down, as ideally we're meant to cooperate together and not be slaves of one another.","3240":"Seeker: Hey guys. until the exam is half a year left . but I understand absolutely nothing.

These days I just can't seem to concentrate on my studies or even do my assignments. I just have no motivation to do so. I'm slowly getting tired of this routine of endless studying. What should I do to get out of this burnout?\n\nResponse: Maybe you could break the routine somehow, like change your study space? Go to a cafe or the library or stay in your dorm (if you're in college)? That's what I tried to do when I was in a studying slump. I went to a cafe instead and it helped a little bit. You could even treat yourself to something there. That definitely relaxed me. As for a means for motivation, if my depressive symptoms didn't completely take over, what used to drive me during hard times was my end goal, the career I was aiming for. Hope this helps!!","488":"Seeker: Doing literally anything feels like an ordeal.. All I do is sit on the computer or lay in bed because that's all that doesn't feel painfully hard to do. I can't do anything or move on with my life.\n\nResponse: I'm right with you, for years. I bought a VR headset because I needed to use vacation from work. I only put it on for 10 min in 7 days off. I just slept and watched the odd video. I wish I had the energy to feel what I used to from games. It was my only real escape.","8309":"Seeker: I'm gonna smoke my last hit of weed, try to feel happy, probably cry. I have $14 in my bank account\n\nResponse: That's terrible. I can understand the struggle they must be. This world is not sustainable for a lot of people.","2561":"Seeker: How do I know if I have clinical depression?. I just feel shitty all the time even though the reasons are tiny and petty\n\nResponse: Sometimes the reasons for having depression are irrelevant. If your gut instincts are telling you you may be depressed, then there could be some truth to it. At this stage you should be seeking treatments and seeing if you notice any differences in how you feel. I'd recommend running outdoors for 45 minutes at least 5 times a week. This is actually more powerful than antidepressant medication and without unhealthy side effects - on the contrary - it strengthens connections in the brain which are responsible for feeling good. Give this a try and see how you feel.","2314":"Seeker: I\u2019m holding on.. depressed as shit, but holding on. not giving up.\n\nResponse: a sign of emotional strength and mental strength.

I am currently taking Lexapro once a day and my doc just prescribed me Wellbutrin. I was just wondering if anyone has ever been on this combo before. I am currently on Lexapro for Depression and Anxiety. My depression is becoming less manageable the longer I am on Lexapro. I am also tired all of the time. I am scared to try any other SSRI's as they have really messed with my libido in the past. My doctor suggested Wellbutrin but I am a little worried about how I will react to it. Just wanted to come here and see if anyone has taken both and what your experience was ?\n\nResponse: I was on Lexapro and Wellbutrin for the longest time and didn't have any bad side effects, but it definitely didn't help me as much as I'd hoped. It did get me from I can't leave my bed to I guess I can function occasionally on a good day. I'm no longer on the Lexapro but the Wellbutrin has stuck with me for a while, so. It went well for me; Hope it goes well for you!","278":"Seeker: Anyone else rely on porn to suppress the fact that you can't find love?. I feel like absolute crap when I watch porn but then again I don't have a girlfriend, or someone that I like to consider me to love. It's fucking corny but I thought it would help to share my thoughts, anyone else?\n\nResponse: I think porn and affection are different really. You wouldn't love a friend just to fuck them, you love someone emotionally. Do you have a tinge of 'why the fuck did I do that' after watching porn? I used to see a lot of shit. It takes time to quit this drug that controls your actions. I hope you find someone, I haven't, but I just try and remember friends, cute girls, whom I'd never imagine in that situation. Buy a scarf and choke yourself until it hurts if you want to think straight.","586":"Seeker: Every body know i want to kill myself but nobody care. A few month ago, i told to my mum the fact that i whas thinking of killing myself, and she didn't even react to it, so now i'm just lost on my way to sucide (Sry for my bad english)\n\nResponse: Maybe she just didn't know how to react to it... or just in shock. i think you should see a therapist because it seems that you're a danger to yourself or you could talk to a close friend about your suicidal thoughts. There's more to life than people's validation about you, trust me. It really gets better overtime. Bad thoughts will come and it will pass, you need to find support of others to overcome it.","6856":"Seeker: Feel like trash, skipped classes today because I just couldn't get myself out of bed. I'm tired and depression is kicking my ass. I really really wish I could get professional help\n\nResponse: i skipped one class today because i don't really get much out of the class, but i forgot that there was 5% of the grade for in-class activities, so i'll probably not skip any more classes","5724":"Seeker: Too depressed to stop being depressed. I feel like if I was my non-depressed self, I would be able to get myself out of the situation that's making me depressed.\n\nResponse: its so weird being depressed and feeling like i cant help other depressed people. so when i think of what to say my first thought is  WEL1 W4T I5 MAKING U DEPRESSED?  Is there something going on in your life bud?","1487":"Seeker: All I ever get is just failures. No matter how hard I try, i will always fail. It seems like it is already fixed that be a fuckup for the rest of my life. I am tired.\n\nResponse: I'm unsure of your situation but, I want to tell you that there is such a thing called the negativity bias. It might just be not seeing the success that is occurring, trust me it sucks as I am trying to get over it myself. maybe taking a moment and thinking about a small victory and how you can expand on that victory might help. But no matter what I want you to succeed.","430":"Seeker: Post-suicide Questions I Wanted to Ask. I started writing my letters today and I wondered how people would receive them if they were electronic. These letters arent really something I can handwrite in a timely manner without having the courage to keep writing. Do the police access the computer and shift through the belongings to find the letters or wouls I have to send them out myself to have them delivered? What happens to my belongings? If I lock myself in a nonshared dorm room and kill myself, how long would it take to find my body and who would be responsible for cleaning it up? Would it leave my family in debt? Would blowing my head off or hanging myself leave my body in a state where it's unusable for a funeral? I'm turning 20 in 2 months and I'm just too tired. Id like to finally be able to rest and not have to live a conitant life of fear and sadness. As much as I do not want to keep living this kind of life, I am too tired to keep pushing through any longer and I'd just like for my death to be somewhat feasible for my mom and sibling.\n\nResponse: the thing, though, your death be feasible. Your mom and sibling would spend the rest of their lives wondering if it was something they did or said that pushed you over the edge, or thinking about what they could have done differently to be there for you. One of both of them would likely spiral into a depression of their own. I used to think that no one would miss me much if I killed myself, but always remember the sound of my brothers voice when he found me with blood pouring from my arm. That something that you can just get over. Even leaving notes really help the pain for your family. Also consider the suffering of the people who found you. It could be an RA or a dorm mate. They would be traumatized for life, with severe PTSD from seeing a dead, decomposing body. That point would be too late for you to do anything, so we try not to let it go that far. get me wrong, I know where coming from, and not trying to make you feel bad for would be wrong. And clear from the fact that even thinking about these things that you have some reservations, so build on that. Take every little good thing that happens to you and imagine never feeling that way again, and imagine robbing the people you love of those feelings as well. Forgive me for being brash, but there is absolutely nothing delicate or glorious about suicide. The people who experience it secondhand go through ten times the suffering of the people who commit it. Please, for the sake of a stranger on the internet who cares about you, think again. There is hope out there, even if everything seems hopeless right now.","203":"Seeker: im really tired. every day is too much.\n\nResponse: I support and am thankful for you, friend.","2712":"Seeker: Today I felt a lot better than I did in the past year, but now I feel dead again. Will you fucking fuck off depression?!\n\nResponse: I know the feeling. It sucks. But maybe now when you had even short moment of relief, maybe even happiness, you know it's possible to feel that way and you can try to get energy from that. Hope it doesn't sound stupid. Stay strong.","3997":"Seeker: Why. I'm drunk because I have nobody to get drunk with. It feels good that I can kind of get my mind off of things. I haven't been very happy lately. Isn't Christmas the happiest time of the year?\n\nResponse: Hey, what's up?  In general, it is the happiest time of year, but on an individual level, happiness can be at any level, any time of year.","2320":"Seeker: i need drugs more than anything. i need something to make me feel happy.\n\nResponse: with you.

How do you love someone who is always there for you at your happiest moments, but leaves you when you're down?\n\nResponse: Appreciate that you have someone to love I guess I don't know the situation.

GYM = pain I hate myself = I want to can I use this thinking to me to go to the GYM with the objective to myself? Is someone capable of such power? Haha\n\nResponse: What are your goals? Take away any kind of emotional association you have and focus on your goals and just do it. Most people like going to the gym, but most people like to be unhealthy. Just do it.","2445":"Seeker: Something that kept me going.. Depression has already fked my past, I won't let it do the same to my future.\n\nResponse: I remember this one!

I feel that life is just a blur for me I'm having the worst year of my entire life but I can't give up. You too must be passing a bad time there but don't let that makes you kill yourself you are worth living. You are a beautiful human being and you have the chance to go on. Hope it changes your mind. I'll be there for you if you need me.","2768":"Seeker: Started punching my face. Yesterday i hated myself so much that i punched my face a few times... Its time for me to get help... tuesday iam going in a psychiatry\n\nResponse: I started this a little while ago too. Don't do it often, once every few months or so when I get really worked up and I start losing myself. Thing is, I like it. Not in a weird kinky way lmao but like, man it just gets me so revved up ya know? Like after I feed myself a few shots with each hand and I can feel the side of my face starting to swell up I feel like I can take on the fucking world head on. It's something that has actually made me heavily consider taking up boxing because it's win win. I get to punch something AND I get to get punched in the face back.","2210":"Seeker: I'm so ready to die.

After having mental health issues for the past 5 years, i don't even know how it's like to feel normal. And the days when i'm not depressed and i feel normal i just feel weird and fake. It's like i'm used to feeling depressed.\n\nResponse: I used to feel like that, pretty sure I have a post from a few months almost exactly the same. But it does get better friend. You can overcome those feelings, it takes effort but it is possible. Hope you get better soon","2555":"Seeker: .... I desperately need aid in this instance of my depression, to handle it. I'm already in an severe episode and what's coming is different, it feels much darker. Please, help.\n\nResponse: Just do your best man. going through dark times (probably the worst of my entire life), just keep trucking on.","7390":"Seeker: My mind is stuck on a loop of the same negative thoughts..

Sending good vibes.","2929":"Seeker: There's too much. I can't fix everything :( Can't fix anything at all recently\n\nResponse: You can't fix everything because that's impossible. No one would expect you to fix everything. You're only human ya know","9199":"Seeker: I guess I can never drink.

I know I'm just a stranger on the internet, but I'm here if you need to talk.","2632":"Seeker: I know I need to get professional help now, but I am scared to. I don't want to admit to myself or anyone matter of fact that I've been depressed for so long.. I just want to be happy.\n\nResponse: Are you feeling that you would be judged? Judging yourself? You should not be ashamed for taking actions that might help you be happier.","747":"Seeker: Starting new meds and looking at about a month more of hell.. So I was getting ready to switch meds when I had to switch insurance. Old Dr wasn't covered anymore and it has taken almost 4 weeks to find a new one. During this time I got low enough to have a passive attempt at harming\/killing myself because I was totally off meds. So today I get into the dr and get prescribed zoloft. Staring at the lowest dose and increasing by 25 MG a week. I asked if there was anything she could give me to help me now and she said no, I just have to tough it out. So fucking ruined by this. The whole system seems to be against people with depression. Any one have any ideas that can help me get through this?\n\nResponse: Hate to say it, but it sounds like you might have a bad dr. One time during a depressive episode I happened to tell my dr everything that was going on with me (similar to your situation) he started me on a new medication but did not mess around with a lower dose. Just a thought, that maybe she shouldn't have started you on the lowest dose assuming she knew you had attempted, that is.","1913":"Seeker: I haven\u2019t worked in over a year because I get so Fucking anxious and scared. a complete joke. I wanna fucking kill myself\n\nResponse: Been there... but can I give a really cool trick that might truly help? When looking for a job, try to find a new store\/restaurant\/place opening up. No matter what it is... It was my trick back into the work force because when a place is just opening, everyone is new and everyone is learning so all in it together, instead of walking into an established place where people already know what doing and have friends etc... anyway, what worked for me in the end. Either way, keep trying. Taking it one step at a time.. fill out applications and if you get phone calls set up interviews. If you get too anxious and go then go, but maybe one day have that little extra burst of energy and go. And if you start working and like it, ok, you can look elsewhere. So just keep pushing along.","303":"Seeker: My head is exploding.. All of this.How do you cope with this life?\n\nResponse: Antidepressants, therapy, naps, bubble baths, tea, cat snuggles, books, watching movies curled up on the couch with a pillow and blanket, time spent in nature, a good cry. Hang in there my friend.","2477":"Seeker: I'm just tired of being tired. What the title says. I'm just beat.\n\nResponse: That makes me tired just hearing that.

I don't know what else to do\n\nResponse: Just a small bit of advice: self injury can restrict your life even more, you won't be able to grasp success nor a blade. Simply stay strong, however hard it may be.","921":"Seeker: Bad evening. toddler cut her own hair.\n\nResponse: It may suck in hindsight. But her hair will grow back and you'll have a story to tell. It happens. You have to look at kids as things of wonder. They learn the hard way. They always will. Just be happy that they're alive to make those mistakes. Love them when they make mistakes.

I'm just so sick of everything.\n\nResponse: What happened? I know these days, where I slept 14 hours not wanting to get up, shouting into my pillow, getting disappointed by everyone and then getting drunk alone. The worst day of my life was during a holiday, where I fell in love with a woman and thought she love me back, sleep a second, self harm, etc. And that day was followed by the best day of my life, we kissed and become a couple :). Life is full of suprises. You can talk to me here, if you want to.","2859":"Seeker: My suicidal thought is imploding on me and I AM EXTREMELY MOTIVATED to do it. I am afraid I will do something.... My hands are shaking... and my heart is physically hurting.\n\nResponse: Alright breathe. Its going to be okay. Your adrenaline is pumping and you're not thinking clearly. Take a moment step outside, get a snack or some thing to drink. Its going to be okay. Unfortunately, you didn't give any description so I'm not sure what I can help you with but man...I can tell you one thing. Things sure do have a funny way of fixing itself or getting better even when you least expect it to. Keep your chin up.","1917":"Seeker: I am a complete fucking asshole. why cause them pain if I don't have to?\n\nResponse: hey we are all assholes sometimes. Your post is kind of vague, so I'm not sure what to say but yeah I've been a huge dick sometimes too. We're human and we make mistakes.","3906":"Seeker: I dropped out.

There have been multiple times where I wondered if this was a good idea for me, but I have 3 pets at home so it could never be an option unless I were married or something. Lol. Anyway, know you are brave and I am so proud of you for taking initiative to help yourself. You deserve to get better and I believe in you!","2311":"Seeker: Feel as if I'm dead.

Every day I wake up and wish I didn't.\n\nResponse: I feel this way too. It doesn't help that our world is owned and run by lying sociopaths.","1057":"Seeker: My mum found me trying to commit suicide. Today was supposed to be it. I shouldn't be alive right now.

I don't really give a shit about celebrating, because it feels like I'm celebrating nothing except for my own mental decline as the years drag on. I'm gonna sit alone in my room doing jack squat because I'm too embarrassed to ask the 1.5 friends I have what they're doing because it implies I'm a loser with no plans and also because I literally don't care. This year has been primarily a grind with very little reward. Every year we tell ourselves we will get better only for things to feel more and more blah. Everyone expects me to do something but I just don't see why. God I just wanna sleep these upcoming 24 hours away\n\nResponse: I spent entire life alone","1885":"Seeker: I wonder where my special someone is?.

However, I've recently been having more and more suicidal thoughts. What should I do if I do become suicidal? Would I need to go to a mental hospital? Thanks for any and all advice\n\nResponse: The more it manifests itself the more it'll take over your mind and convince you that it's a completely logical choice. I'm a fan of therapy, considering that you can find a good therapist. Talking to someone who doesn't degrade you for how you feel can be incredibly helpful. Those people tend to be hard to find in daily life.","2972":"Seeker: How do I tell someone that comments like cheer up aren't helpful?. I don't want to come off rude or anything.

It's all pointless.\n\nResponse: Sometimes, I feel like this is okay though. The not being okay. I think there's this expectation we all have just because everyone else and everything around us shows this picture perfect life that is normal. Also, I get to the opinion sometimes that when none of it matters, it's actually the most liberating, because then I am truly free of my worldly concerns. I don't know. Silver lining and framing and all that jazz. Best of luck, friend.","2410":"Seeker: I'm pathetic. If I see girls or anything about couples or marriage, I get super sad and feel like crying. My depression is just getting worse day by day.\n\nResponse: Hey, I feel the same way. quite demoralizing to see everyone in a relationship when all you want at times. Most of my friends are in committed relationships. So, been times where I was the only single guy in the room. I say anything, but deep down it kind of hurts. I help but think I just I realize that not something I could say to anyone else. I could never look at anyone call them unlovable. So why can I say it myself? Why do we think such nasty thoughts about ourselves? My friend, you do deserve love, and I hope that it comes to you. :) Oh, and social media is terrible for this type of feeling btw. been staying off Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat lately. I now feel a lot more secure in my status as not constantly bombarded with pictures of happy couples (who are also usually just posing for the picture, sometimes they break up the next day).","863":"Seeker: I miss him. I miss my first boyfriend. He did very terrible things to me in the end and literally messed up my emotions. It's been like 3 months and I haven't thought about him anymore until a week ago. He's starting to haunt me more and more. Please help...\n\nResponse: As that was your first ever boyfriend, I understand you missing him. If I ever get a first girlfriend, I would miss her too.

Why am I torturing myself with school and late homework? WHY AM I NOT BRAVE ENOUGH TO KILL MYSELF!? I'm a goddamn failure. I can't even do this final act.\n\nResponse: No one's brave for killing themselves. It's the *fear* of living that drives them to end their lives. But something inside you wants to live. If that wasn't true, you'd be dead by now. I'm glad you're still here, and I hope one day you can be too :)","2499":"Seeker: Since I can't say it to anybody anymore.

Have you thought about maybe volunteering, working in nature and meeting positive people perhaps? And meditate, many people your age and situation start to look into meditation for long-lasting happiness. It's the perfect time. Do you have any possessions? Sell it, you may find that you will be better off without them = ) Feel free to chat to me if you want. You don't have to look at this as a dead-end, but a start to a beautiful journey. I don't post in r\/depression, well because it says to Do not post or respond with: it gets better messages. How does that make you feel? I find that ridiculous lol.

Ever since I started college it's gotten worse. I'll walk to dining halls at Times I know people who'll recognize me won't be there and when going to class I'll look down with my headphones so they won't greet me. I have no idea why\n\nResponse: I know all too well what you mean. People scare and anger me, have for years, and as a result I don't actually have a single person I would consider a friend and have never had a relationship, but I crave that stuff every night. It causes hard insomnia worrying about if I'll have to be alone forever with no friends or partners to the point I can only sleep out of exhaustion, but then once I have and I wake up the next morning, I'll loathe that I have to go outside and interact with people for work. It's a daily nightmare. I would say that MAYBE, if I gave advice on it, it would be that I used to have a similar thing with shyness, and with that I pushed myself into more and more social situations and now am not so shy. It MAYBE might work the same way with liking\/disliking social interaction. But I do that everyday and I still don't like people. I'm more COMFORTABLE around them, but I still don't LIKE them. And it's an entirely different ball park with depression\/anxiety than shyness, otherwise if it were so easy to just 'force' yourself to socialize to fix the problem, I'd be doing it myself. If pushing yourself into those situations does help, I hope you find the courage to do it sometime, buddy.","3005":"Seeker: Why should I stay?. Whats the point? Who really gives a fuck? Nobody...none of you people look at me ...none of you see me for who i could be. Why should i stay... got 15 mins to save a life..and go\n\nResponse: Because there'll be better days. I know you what you think. That it's bs but it's true. I've fallen so hard yet sooner or later there's that one thing happening and then it gets better. If you off yourself now think about all the things you couldn't expirience? Your first kiss, playing with your child, true love, a beautiful landscape that you maybe planned on visiting, the smell of rain, the taste of your favorite food, that awesome feeling of completing a task and it goes on and on. I know how you feel. I didnt believe it either but it's true. It may take years to come but there'll be a moment later where'll you say im happy that i didnt kill myself","1403":"Seeker: I can't.

The trouble is that no one has bothered to follow that statement up with *how* I push people away. You know? Like, the first time someone said it to me I had no idea it was even a thing I did, but they give me any feedback. Anyone else in the same boat? Point is, OP, I feel ya.

Sometimes I think about the baggage I carry with me and feel sorry for whoever gets stuck with a guy like me.\n\nResponse: Definitely. I want my ex back more than anything, we broke up over a year ago, she's got a kid with someone else now and it hurts a lot, but it was my fault. I wasn't the nicest person to be around sometimes, I did a lot of good in the relationship, but a lot of bad too. I'm not proud of it, I'm ashamed of it, I regret it all, I hate myself over the things I've done. I think that's what makes the breakup worse, knowing that it was my fault, that I could have saved it if I had just stayed on my medication. I keep trying to convince myself she broke my heart, but I broke both mine and hers through my actions. Still doesn't make it any less painful and I wish I could just end it all right now.","3508":"Seeker: Depression and celebrities. Hey there everyone.

My best friend moved to a different country this past year and I had an extreme emotional connection to him. A girl that i had a crush on also left around the same time. I am trying to make friends but I think they really don't like me. I am just feeling so tired of this constant empty feeling inside of my body. I am 16 years old and i just hate school. How should I handle this situation?\n\nResponse: Man I just turned 17 yesterday and I dont think ive had a real life friend since highschool started, so basically I dont think i'll be very helpful but i'd still like to respond. I also dropped out a few weeks ago which I do regret but I just couldnt keep up with the new school I transfered to.  The thing that has been helping me lately, and what my pyschiatrist told me, was to get a hobby. I like to read a lot of japanese books so I picked up on the language so I could start reading them directly from Japan. It's not much of a hobby, reading books and learning a new language, but it gives me something to live for. I want to read a thousand new stories because I love many of the ones I have already read.  I do however think friends are important, although I have none in real life. If anyone at all tries to be your friend, I think you should try and be more open to making friends instead of like me. The last person that tried being friends with me I pushed away a lot and faked most of our friendship, but I regret that since he was willing to put in the effort so I think he deserves to have a good friendship. Don't be fake, people will like you for who you are.","4137":"Seeker: Books to read for depressed people? (Both good and sad, anything that you like).

I just finished binging BoJack Horseman, and something that gets brought up semi-regularly is your own What is this and how do I avoid it?\n\nResponse: It means that you have transformed your misery in a fundamental aspect of your identity and anything and everything that happens in your life is gonna be somehow linked to that. It is gonna become impossible to differ between what is truly a hardship from what you are deciding to see as such, because pain has settled within yourself to the point that things would not make any sense if it was not present, so you will inflict it upon yourself to return to the only state of familiarity that you know: being miserable. The term fetishizing is used in a harsh, accusatory, pejorative way, blaming the characters for perpetually watching their lives through the blackest prism, but the truth is they just do not know any better than to do so. Furthermore, fetishes are often believed to be shameful and obscene in nature, because such random, nonsexual items PRODUCE intense satisfaction, whereas people that are accused of fetishizing sadness are just sheltering themselves (if i fuck myself up, no one else will).","6917":"Seeker: maybe being introverted is a good thing. knowing less people means there are less people to hurt me\n\nResponse: I guess it makes a person more defensive against other people but it really depends on the person?

Enter depression.\n\nResponse: Yup, my therapist described this to me as a triangle: Thoughts fuel feelings which fuel our interactions which fuel thoughts. She said that the only way to escape the loop was to break one of the parts. Obviously breaking interactions would just put on a facade, so she suggested breaking either thoughts by changing perception to be more of what she called rational, (through looking at the ups and downs of any situation instead of deciding based just on the downs) or breaking feelings by re-evaluating them using a similar method.  &amp;nbsp;  I've always unknowingly found myself back in the loop over and over again, but what I would do in your situation would be to look at things objectively, put a self-aware lens over your life, see what you can do to make it better and make choices from there.","7432":"Seeker: How to live without any thing to live for?.

Also, I don't understand sexuality probably because of my autism. Remember, it's not a competition. Once you lose it, you can't get it back.

Symptom meaning emotional deadness.","9162":"Seeker: .... Why did you make my friend kill herself\n\nResponse: I am sorry. I don't know what to say.","6060":"Seeker: I have no future. So I just realized that because my depression and anxiety don't let me work or study or have social interactions, and I've been with 10 Psychiatrists and 6 psychologists and I'm still like this I have no future, so what do I do now?\n\nResponse: Some people will keep trying, and they cling onto hope. Others give up and accept they will never be able to function like normal people. Some will vent and turn into incels. Others just quietly feel sorry for themselves. And honestly, every single one of those options is perfectly okay, because no one can blame you for how society fucked up mental illness.","4401":"Seeker: I wish I had the courage to end it. I'm lying in bed fucking crying myself to sleep over wanting to die, like it's the only fucking thing I want and I can't fucking do it, I fucking hate life my life so much\n\nResponse: I am glad you aren't doing it, I am lucky myself in that I was equally lazy and depressed when I was at my worst, but by doing nothing you aren't making a terrible mistake. Thanks for redditing with us tonight.","8933":"Seeker: Ugly af. Being a solid 3.5 and having a thing for 10s is tough\n\nResponse: Everybody has a thing for 10s tho, numeral ratings for people are dumb anyways. If you get to know people you can develop feelings for them not only based on physical appearance or even find out after all they're not that attractive in the end. Granted it plays a huge part initially and people who say otherwise are hypocrits but yeah it doesn't just stop there. But still, I am ugly and I hate myself haha","7564":"Seeker: im going to kill myself. i cant handle it anymore, i cant sleep or eat, im just done, anyone have any methods?\n\nResponse: Hey man if you ever need to talk to anyone im here.

I live for my kids and wife. If not for them, I am gone. It crosses my mind at least once a month. Been fighting this for 7 years. Its hard. But pray. It has helped me.","3616":"Seeker: I just dont want to live anymore. Shit fuck im very tired\n\nResponse: You are loved and you can get through this.","2130":"Seeker: Why do you always say 'Sorry' so much? What are you apologizing for?. Existing. Sorry I bother everyone by saying I'm sorry too much.\n\nResponse: Have you considered that maybe you say sorry sometimes when you should be saying thank you? Making this post into an example, instead of apologizing, you could thank people for tolerating how overly apologetic you are. Calling someone else kind and understanding is more constructive than putting yourself down.","4653":"Seeker: The number of times I say I hate myself in my head is uncontrollable. It kinda comes out on its own like I'm hungry\n\nResponse: For me, it's the number of times I say, I hate my life and I hate people.","5292":"Seeker: lol. Today morning I woke up and thought.

I'm just stuck and afraid personally.\n\nResponse: Make a resume and send it out","932":"Seeker: There is no escape from the loneliness. If no woman wants to date you, no woman wants to date you, and no amount of diet and exercise changes it. I get blocked for saying hello... all my family grew old and died. All my friends got married and moved away. I live in hell, alone.\n\nResponse: I feel alone also. Although people want to date me I always feel they are just using me for my appearance and do not care about anything I have to say or care about me irl","3707":"Seeker: Please don't leave me. I don't want to be alone.\n\nResponse: I love how nice people are to each other in this sub.

So, all these responsibilities must be dealt by myself. I cannot share my inner struggles with anyone, maybe because I do not want to worry\/disturb them.

As a kid I would feel anxious and horrible that I am still alive and wasting time. Today is still a struggle but looking forward to how time will unfold.\n\nResponse: Another holiday alone, not looking forward to this stupid holiday. New year, life is still shit.

The holidays remind of how alone I really fucking am.","4435":"Seeker: I\u2019m afraid.. I know what to do or where to go or what to say or how to help or how to change or how to exist. lost, confused, sad, angry, frustrated, and just afraid. so afraid.\n\nResponse: Hello there, don't worry, you're not alone!  It's good you are reaching out in a state of confusion, it's better in a way that it can help you get a grip of things again. Just know you're not alone for now and that I'd like to lend an ear if you feel comfortable to. We're in this together.","8801":"Seeker: Sleeping in the bathtub. Moved my pillow and cover into the tub tonight. Because it's just one of those days. I'm so depressed that I want to die. And sleeping in a freaking tub somehow makes me feel better.\n\nResponse: You do whatever you need to do.","8267":"Seeker: Depressed. I am depressed as hell, what to do?\n\nResponse: Depends on what you want to do. Be rid of it? Or get better at handling it? Did it come out of nowhere? Or have you had it for a while?","4107":"Seeker: 4:27am. 22 years old. Alone in my room, lying in bed in darkness, listening to music... This night is no different than the last couple of thousands of nights. Am I hopeless?. No job, no friends, no relationships, no kisses or hugs from anyone, nothing. Just a shell of a human being who likes to think he has some undefined potential but no motivation to actually bring it out. Is this a dream?\n\nResponse: This could've been written by me, are you my doppelganger? The icing on the cake is having no girlfriend for me.  Knowing that you're ugly to the gender you love so much is so depressing and discouraging while you've spend years on the subject on how to improve, to behave, studying statistics, seeking out more information. All for nothing...  My life is pointless without women I don't see a reason to live my life single and alone and won't allow it to continue for much longer.","3861":"Seeker: buckshot or slug. not trying to turn myself into a vegetable and decrease my quality of life even farther, so which one is going to do be more effective?\n\nResponse: Please please please call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline 1-800-273-8255","1254":"Seeker: Depression isn\u2019t wanting to not exist, its more not wanting to exist feeling like this.

And enjoy those times when they last.","3217":"Seeker: Sometimes it difficult to ask for help.

I think you would be surprised sometimes the people who would be willing to help","4503":"Seeker: Once again, I can't get out of bed.. I want to change, but I don't know what to do, I feel powerless. It's happening all over again. What do you guys do in such a situation? I'm trying so badly to regain myself, but it seems impossible.\n\nResponse: One thing at a time, get up, shower.

We both have depression and similar backgrounds growing up. We are able to talk to each other, understand each other. Better than our respective spouses can understand our depression. The only problem is that I'm still not completely over her. She still has a soft spot for me too but it isn't the same as what I feel.  We broke up 35 years ago.  &amp;#x200B;","9012":"Seeker: Happy birthday to me. I guess. Looks like it's time to get drunk and lay on the couch. Again.

How did your friends and family react? Just curious. Feel free to add where your from since its probably a lot different with the medical part from country to country..\n\nResponse: I'll hit you with the two most powerful stats I learned: Less than 25% of the people who attempt to kill themselves and live, ever try again. Ever. Only 7% of people who have attempted end up dying by suicide. So, chances are what happens is a lot of regret for the pain the action can cause others, but also the realization of how many people do care and would help and support if called upon.","7424":"Seeker: I thought i'd never have to come to this sub again, and here I am. guess it'll haunt me forever\n\nResponse: write me. write me about whats bothering you. sometimes putting all his worries in order is the best relief to start with","8047":"Seeker: Depression and alcohol. I don't abuse alcohol. I typically only have it on the weekend nights, with a max of three drinks in one night. Is this something that is only hurting me? Should I give it up completely?

Also, does it interact with medicines you are taking?","6607":"Seeker: If you do something long enough, it rewires your brain. That's both of good and ill. I know certain habits and crutches just encourage the depressive and anxiety feelings. But as I try new things, new therapies, they become less scarry and more normalized. So there's always hope.\n\nResponse: Care to extrapolate on some positive examples of your brain rewiring? The only experience I have with this is my weed addiction since I was 16 and now I'm 20 :\/. Only smoked once this last week tho so things are looking up","5081":"Seeker: Writing it out. I tried to write my feelings down on a piece of paper but it stayed blank. And somehow, it have been any more accurate.\n\nResponse: Spend some time just to meditate and clear out your mind. Take a walk around town. Maybe go buy a coffee, something to distract yourself before you attempt the 'writing assignment'.  Just start simple. It doesn't have to be in paragraph form or even complete sentences. Maybe bullet points will make it easier.","1386":"Seeker: I'm going to get medication soon.. It's either that or it's over. I'm done trying\n\nResponse: Oh boy, I was also upset. I was about 15 and felt like such a loser. Now I'm so glad I got help at a young age.","809":"Seeker: Literally Bawling my eyes out.. Life absofuckinglutley sucks. WHY was I fucking born.

I just finished a whole bottle of wine and am only slightly tipsy. Feelsbadman\n\nResponse: I'm in the same boat, if I do get drunk it's not the fun kind it's more like all those depressing thoughts start boiling over. I don't drink liquor anymore for that reason, now I stick to a few beers every night and that's usually enough to help me relax.","7464":"Seeker: Suicidal protocol?. I'm not suicidal right now, and I would like not to kill myself. However, I've recently been having more and more suicidal thoughts. What should I do if I do become suicidal? Would I need to go to a mental hospital?  Thanks for any and all advice\n\nResponse: The more it manifests itself the more it'll take over your mind and convince you that it's a completely logical choice.  I'm a fan of therapy, considering that you can find a good therapist. Talking to someone who doesn't degrade you for how you feel can be incredibly helpful. Those people tend to be hard to find in daily life.","861":"Seeker: Can my doctor hospitalise me.. I live in Australia and over the age of 18. If i tell my doctor that i want to kill myself and have a plan and note can they hospitalise me\n\nResponse: If it's anything like here in New York, walk into an emergency room and tell them you're there because you want to kill your self. That's probably the easiest fastest way, since you'll probably have to wait to talk to your doctor.","3237":"Seeker: Another twelve hour graveyard shift. And I forgot to take my meds.. It's gonna be a long night &lt;\/3\n\nResponse: Sorry to hear that. Hopefully it goes by quick.","5776":"Seeker: I feel like i have just wasted 20 years of my life..

Fucking gets me down as hell seeing everyone on Instagram with their significant other. Having a good time. Someone getting proposed to, people saying how happy they are to have so and so with them. I cant fucking do it. Makes me feel super down...\n\nResponse: Hey man same here, I consider myself a loner too. never been in a relationship personally, if anything, they slow you down. If anything your friends are just showboating and most of their relationships will turn to shit regardless in later time.","6627":"Seeker: I'm finally on medication and found a therapist who makes me feel hopeful for the first time in years. It has been a while since I've felt sincere hope.\n\nResponse: im envious of the fact that you want hope","6444":"Seeker: Self-doubt. Sometimes I wonder whether I'm just going through a teenage phase. Even though I've been diagnosed with depression, part of me just wonders whether I'm lying to myself and just insisting in wallowing in misery.  Just needed to get this off my chest.\n\nResponse: My gut reaction is that if you were just insisting in wallowing in misery, you wouldn't be wondering about this.","2799":"Seeker: What do you do when you're in an unhappy relationship, but you don't have the personal strength to end it?. Just endure till one of you dies?\n\nResponse: You pick yourself up and you tell your partner how you're feeling. If there's nothing that can be done to save the relationship, tell your partner. Remember that you loved them once and really you don't want them being with someone who doesn't love them either.","7339":"Seeker: I want to feel good about myself. That's all I want. I want to look myself in the mirror, see all of me, the good and the bad, the past and the present, the regrets and triumphs, and just tell myself This is me, and that's good\n\nResponse: That's hard. Especially if you're the type of person to post in this sub. Loving yourself is really difficult. But loving others is easier. And I do love you. When you love others, I find, its easier to love yourself. Even just saying the words and seeing it echoed back makes me feel good. I hope I helped.","4960":"Seeker: Depression. How do u deal when you are feeling very depressed and alone and dont have much support or ppl who care about you???\n\nResponse: Lots and lots of alcohol lmfao","4339":"Seeker: How do you guys push through when you're hanging by a thread?. I've made it almost two years since my last suicide attempt and I want to keep pushing that number higher. When you guys are really pushed to your limit, is there anything you do so that you can keep going?\n\nResponse: I'm feeling that way now. And this is just me, I actually don't recommend it for others, but we're sharing, so for me I am literally laying in my bed right now, watching rubbish on TV and disconnecting myself from the entire world because it's the only way I'll make it through the night.","5499":"Seeker: Nausea. I am the only one who feel this nausea 24\/7??\n\nResponse: Definitely anxiety related for me. usually okay but had a stressful night a few nights ago and just felt nauseous since. Gets really bad when just laying in bed to the point where I sleep cause I think gonna throw up hoping it passes soon","4167":"Seeker: When you have to stay alive for someone else. I just can't leave my friend who just lost a family member to suicide and I'm the closest friend.  &amp;#x200B;  But I just wanna die\n\nResponse: Well at least you still can hold on to that choice. Being terminally ill for the past 7 years (Im 42 now) the physical pain of a slow and horrible illness has led to my depression and desire to die. It is up to my wife though. And for her I live every day in hell. When you have even one person to keep you going, it can be enough.  I am a lurker here and I read posts to give me perspective. Rarely can I physically reply. But what my experience being bound to a bed 24\/7 has taught me is that once I made my peace with dying, I became indifferent to everything.  For myself It's been tough to see people truly depressed to the point of wanting to die. I am very empathetic, but my depression is a symptom so its hard to understand. The one thing I do understand though is that the last thing you want to hear is Don't do it!!! Call this number... or other similar programmed\/indoctrinated responses.  So just know this... The world and life can be one big shitshow... So it helps to keep toilet paper handy. Let your friend be your toilet paper and be your friends toilet paper. It will be enough.   Lastly... Just remember that no matter how bad life feels (and is...) even I am artificially grateful for the fact that I have a far better life right now (suffering from *pain and bound to a bed), than 99.999999% of all humans to have ever lived. Just try to make it as long as you can. Know how much worse it can be. And let your toilet paper know that you need them to help clean up some shit. Then when you are ready to go.... You will know. But I cant see it happening for you as long as you remain attached to someone that you can call a friend. So give yourself a list of requirements that must be met for you to end it all. *- Pain so severe that causes me to vomit my own feces at times as it sends my body into shock.  I wish you the best. I hope you can suffer less in time if possible. You and I are here right now... That makes us stronger than those who gave up yesterday. (And if you do one day come to the realization that you must go, make sure to do it in a way that allows your organs be given to help others. It helps me knowing that maybe I will have something that can give a healthy, long, and amazing life for a person who is still able to live it. )  Just think about making the list... And go tell your friend, right now, that you love him\/her... Even if they are not quilted and only 1-ply thickness. You both need that right now... The whole world needs that right now.   Edit: sorry for the novella and my poor humor. Brain isnt what it used to be.","649":"Seeker: I have absolutely nothing original to contribute to or real life.

Just a quick question. Does medication eventually stop working? I have been having a very tough time recently and was wondering if my meds have stopped working . can our bodies build up a tolerance to anti- depressants?\n\nResponse: Depends on the medication, but yes.","4681":"Seeker: It just keeps finding a way to get worse. There's no bottom to this, is there?\n\nResponse: it goes both ways, no lowest ground, no highest ground, these things are subjective.","5707":"Seeker: :(. I feel so alone. My existence is irrelevant.\n\nResponse: Better be irrelevant than an annoyance, trust me","6916":"Seeker: My life feels like a living hell, no one speaks to me and all my family do is insult me. I can't cope anymore. I'm so sick of this shit. Every damn day someone in my family has something bad to say to me. I had my curtains opened and was in my room earlier and my christian grandmother shouted at me to close them. That's how petty she is. I told her I wanted them open and she started her usual name insulting. Then my mother returns home from her bf's house drunk and telling me I'm mental. Meanwhile no one has spoken to me all day, this is my life daily. Some days I wish I could take a cocktail of pills and just be fucking done with it.\n\nResponse: Why would she want you to close the curtains?","5134":"Seeker: Why most parents are so blind when their child is depress?. I'm a depress and my parents seem like blind about it. Has it happened to someone else? I want to understand **the why?**\n\nResponse: People don't read minds and if you've been the way you are for a long time, people won't notice. Tell your parents how you feel.","3315":"Seeker: I could easily do it right now. It seems so easy to me. Nobody cares now. But they all will soon.\n\nResponse: I want to repeat other comments, but do it. There is nothing afterwards, this is your one chance and you have to make it count. Life is like a train ride, there are turns, twists, hills, curves, but sometimes there are tunnels. And when your in the tunnel for a while you look back and forward but see nothing but darkness, it feels like it is all that is has been and will be. But tunnels always have an end. This train ride of life will get you where you want to go, as long as you get off early.","8516":"Seeker: Everyone at my NYE party is happy but me.

Why it be the answer? Why does it have to be so taboo? Why fo people have to be so sad after a loved on dies? I just want peace, thats all. Death is the only way to get peace.\n\nResponse: Some people might not want you to die. If you need help with suicide, I suggest you go to r\/SuicideWatch   I'm in a bad situation right now but I'm not motivated to do anything, not even suicide.","1654":"Seeker: How do I deal with the pain of loneliness?. It's unbearable. I just want the suffering to end.\n\nResponse: I just want to meet someone. Fuck this. People aren't meant to be alone.","5765":"Seeker: pain with hanging yourself. i always thought hanging yourself would be extremely painful. however i just choked myself with my belt because i was curious. it wasnt really painful and i started to black out quickly. still figuring out when. where and how ill go though. this give me some reassurence though :)\n\nResponse: There is a difference between choking yourself with the belt and dangling your bodyweight from a rope. It will hurt.","3828":"Seeker: In a dark place. I feel at war with my own mind. I feel like my cause of death will eventually be suicide no matter what. I just don't think I can handle this. I hate myself.\n\nResponse: I've been here. I know it's hard to see past the dark clouds now and I know it's cheesy but it DOES get better. I've been in and out of psych wards for suicide attempts my entire life. Where I am now, what I've worked towards, has made everything I've gone through worth it. I am so glad I failed.   There is more to experience in this life than you could imagine and most difficult things are temporary and will pass. Hang in there. Work on yourself. Do the things that make you happy, make you feel something, as long as they aren't harmful. Spend time with your family, your friends or animals. Maybe with yourself or nature. Happiness really is in the little things.","5735":"Seeker: College graduates\/current college students:. How have you gotten through difficult parts of your school year when your depression is severely effecting your academic work? Going through a difficult path this semester and tanked two exams this week already, really looking for some advice to improve.\n\nResponse: Yes, I have. Currently I am a mess. Nevertheless there used to be a time when I was a mess, but still had a reason to pick myself up and get my shit done. If you want to study and pass your exams, this is what I did:  - Get busy studying now (within 15 minutes). No excuses to eat\/drink a bit. Not going to the bathroom. Just study. Phone away. If possible laptop\/computer away. Do this for at least one hour and take a small break to get fresh air if you want and drink some water. NO PHONE. Then back to studying. Again one hour or more.  - After studying go for a run (I don't care if it is 11 pm) or exercise in some other way. - Eat healthy. You crave good tasting food? chocolate? chips? No go. When you go to the supermarket, fast food is not an option. You will not spend your money on that shit. No chips, no sweet stuff, no special drinks. Fruit\/vegetables\/carbs\/meat\/fish\/bread\/milk\/yoghurt. Healthy stuff. Lots of water.  - Go to bed on time. Get out of bed on time. - No thinking! Only actions.  - Do one thing at a time. No thinking about tomorrow or the next hours. Just about the next minute. What are you going to do now? Shower? check. Dress? check. Breakfast? check. Go to library? check. Study one hour? check. Have a small break and drink water? check. continue. - If possible, study with other people - (added) When I get stuck, it has been VERY helpful for me to discuss this with other students. This has been very difficult for me, because I have a crazy amount of pride and am very ashamed of showing I do not understand something. Nonetheless, it has helped me so much to just discuss a problem where i got stuck with someone and then see the light which enables me to continue studying (instead of procrastinating till everything went to shit).  This doesn't solve the deeper problems, but it probably will get you through your exams as good as possible. At least, this is how I managed to finish my undergraduate years. Not healthy, but it worked. Also you will probably find that by being so hard for yourself, setting boundaries and actually following them, you will start to feel a lot better about yourself and gain confidence. This is a trap, do not get satisfied with yourself. Being satisfied and giving yourself more space to slightly cross your boundaries again is equal to getting on the slide that will get you right back into the pit.  This became a rant, hope it helps you in some way.","5470":"Seeker: i dont even know what i feel. or why i feel it, all i know is it feels like a pit in my chest and makes me want to die. how the fuck do you fix an unidentifiable feeling.\n\nResponse: I don't have any feeling inside my chest, ever as far as I can remember. I mean literally, I'm not making some silly metaphor. I'm trying to figure out whether that might be a medical problem, or maybe it's normal and people just talk in metaphors all the time.","212":"Seeker: I'm terrified to seek help. I know I need help. Now. But I'm terrified, especially of what my bf will think. I know I shouldn't be but realistically it's a massive worry. I don't even know where to begin\n\nResponse: Nothing to be afraid of, would your bf be embarassed to go to hospital after breaking his finger? No. Why should you be scared to seek mental help, broken finger hurts, depression if not treated can kill, and in the worst way possible. Go and find yourself a therapist, someone you can tell all about your problems.

I think I'm permenantly numb. Has anybody else experienced this?\n\nResponse: I don't cry under what most people would consider emotional situations. Weddings, funerals, yadda yadda. But once in a while when I'm laying in the dark and I'm alone with my thoughts, it happens. And I curse at myself for such weakness, then.","8849":"Seeker: pain with hanging yourself. i always thought hanging yourself would be extremely painful. however i just choked myself with my belt because i was curious. it wasnt really painful and i started to black out quickly. still figuring out when. where and how ill go though. this give me some reassurence though :)\n\nResponse: There is a difference between choking yourself with the belt and dangling your bodyweight from a rope. It will hurt.","1835":"Seeker: i try to help but never do. always just run out of things to say, im sorry\n\nResponse: I try too but often erase what I say before posting, as if I know all the answers when I'm here for help too. I feel terrible about staying silent but when its serious as life and death I can never post out of fear..","5386":"Seeker: Does anyone else turn the TV on when you're alone, just to hear someone else's voice?. I'm trying to hide from the lonliness.\n\nResponse: I don't really use the tv, but I do usually have a youtube video playing on the background when I'm by the computer. I could be browsing random websites or trying to do some crafting etc, but I need the distraction of the videos. Also if I'm watching a movie or tv show I often have to do something else at the same time - solitaire, browse a magazine, read an article.  I know I can concentrate just on one thing at a time, but there's something about too much quiet bringing bad thoughts to the surface.","53":"Seeker: I can't even drink to escape my sorrows because I can't stand the taste of alcoholic drinks. So at least you guys have that going for you haha.\n\nResponse: Weed make my sorrow funny","455":"Seeker: Anyone else pretend they're some fictional character to get away from thinking about their real pathetic self?. I do all the time. I even have like this made up character that I always pretend is me. They have lots of positive traits and talents unlike me, haha.\n\nResponse: Frequently.

I just wish I would die in an accident or someone would just come along and put me out of my fucking misery.\n\nResponse: I was thinking the same thing like a minute ago. It's kinda reassuring to know I won't have the courage to take my own life, but I'm scared at the thought of what if I'll find the courage? honestly.","6498":"Seeker: My therapist: don\u2019t drink or do drugs Me the next week: so I drank and got high. Love a daily dose of self-sabotage\n\nResponse: A therapist should discourage anything that fuels your depression\/illness","7983":"Seeker: Depression feels like needing 200 mana to do things around the house, when it would normally cost someone 50.. Then everytime you feel ashamed of yourself because of it, the cost rises.\n\nResponse: Don't worry, I'm stacking my tear t_t","3359":"Seeker: I got upset but for the first time since I got ill with depression, I didn't cut..

I'm really starting to hate any good days that I may have. I get one every month or so and it's quite possibly worse than just being depressed. It dosent matter how happy I am or how much I try, I know it will be right back. And worse than a normal day. After a few hours I fall right back down. I honestly don't know why I'm still alive. My life has just been a series of fuck ups. I should be a functioning adult by now and yet I can barely think straight. I'm just running in circles, I do the minimum to survive. Daydreaming is my only escape and even my depression is inhibiting that. Why, why me, why any of us. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.\n\nResponse: You got it all wrong. You should be looking forward to making more of those happy days, if you force yourself to be sad simply because you know you're depressed, you'll never get over it ever. Hang onto those days and strive to make more happy days each month. Depression is fed from negative thought process, let it starve","3691":"Seeker: Kill me.. Nothing helps. No one says anything positive. I'm just a waste of space. I know all my friends could get by without me just fine. No one cares about me.

Does anyone feel the same way?\n\nResponse: Staying at home: regret. Loneliness. Going out: pain, anxiety. Even more loneliness when being in a crowd and having nobody to talk to.

Like, I'll look around me as I sit in lectures or walk around the university campus and think to myself these people are just so stupid, they understand nothing, they're so shallow and empty-headed, and I feel 100% confident in being right, but then I'll try to logically think about why I'm superior (and I'm also 100% certain that I *am* superior), and I come up with nothing. In any quantifiable measure of superiority, I always fail. And yet, I can't shake this feeling that everyone else is inferior to me. I think maybe it's just a gut reaction because of how unhappy and depressed I am, but I don't know. I know that I probably sound like a complete asshole to anyone reading this, but it's how I honestly feel.\n\nResponse: Maybe it's a defense mechanism you created when you were a child? Maybe if you really searched, it's because on the inside you truly feel inferior?","4405":"Seeker: It's my birthday today.. I'm 19 today and nobody has wished me a happy birthday or anything. I've been alone for an incredibly long time and I've been made to feel guilty and miserable by my own family on my birthday. I'm on my way to work just now and I've already slipped on some ice and hurt my back. I hope you all have a better day than me so far. Cheers.\n\nResponse: Happy birthday. I hope you do something fun after work.","2142":"Seeker: Are there any methods to coping with depression and suicidal thoughts that actually works?. Emotional support does nothing for me yet I see it everywhere. I think many of us need some real help\n\nResponse: Depression isn't something you can get rid of by wishing it away or telling someone you have it. A lot like an addiction you have to fight to get out of it. And it's hard to tell what path is right or wrong. Talking to people does help. But you need to find someone you can talk to. I couldn't talk to my mom for the life of me, my sister would tell my mom or tell me I was wrong, my dad just gave me a look and didn't know what to say besides he cares about me. Once my mom knew the extent of my depression she became better at helping me. She listened and didn't judge. She let me talk and told didn't lecture but reassured my decisions. She went out of her way to make me feel more confident. That's the person you need to find. Also try writing your feeling down whatever you feel on a peace of paper what ever is on your mind. Write it in chicken scratch don't worry about how ty write just write what you feel. Then throw the paper away. That used to help me, not as much as my mom did but I did help. Life isn't something we can live alone although a lot of us want to, I wish I could, find someone to confide in that supports you.","2944":"Seeker: I thought I was getting better. I've been in bed all day and literally haven't moved.\n\nResponse: Same here, big exam Tuesday and i barely read anything. Usually i could get my ass out of bed to study but this year i just can't. Maybe go take a little or long walk, been doing it for three days now and at least i don't feel like shit. Your mileage may vary, tho","2606":"Seeker: I spent today either staring blankly at a computer screen or my phone. Was too hurt to do anything today, really.\n\nResponse: I wish I even had the will to play games.
