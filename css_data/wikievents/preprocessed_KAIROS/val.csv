At a rally with public energy workers this month , he said : “ Take the lists of workers from all the state institutions and businesses to create a constituent committee . For each business , call all the workers and organize how they ’ ll vote on July 30th . At the end of the day , check the list . If there are 15 , 000 workers , there have to be 15 , 000 votes , with no excuses . ” Venezuela ’ s political protests have been fueled by the disastrous state of the economy , growing authoritarian rule and the government ’ s resistance to early elections . The country ’ s electoral council ruled against the opposition when it sought a referendum in 2016 that could have cut short Maduro ’ s six - year term . The council also pushed back elections for governors , scheduled for 2016 , to December of this year . Critics fear that the new assembly will cancel those , as well as the presidential election in 2018 . The U . S . Treasury Department in February froze Vice President Tareck El Aissami ’ s American assets over his alleged involvement in narcotics trafficking and took similar action against eight justices of the pro - government supreme court after it tried to strip power from the opposition - led legislature .

The result was Chávez , who used the petroleum wealth to launch massive social programs , even as he concentrated power . He remains much beloved by millions of Venezuelans , although many others — especially in the middle and upper classes — loathe him ."

Yanelis Banco , 36 years old and nearly nine months pregnant , said her boss at the government postal service called her in along with other department heads for a talk last week .

The council also pushed back elections for governors , scheduled for 2016 , to December of this year . Critics fear that the new assembly will cancel those , as well as the presidential election in 2018 . The U . S . Treasury Department in February froze Vice President Tareck El Aissami ’ s American assets over his alleged involvement in narcotics trafficking and took similar action against eight justices of the pro - government supreme court after it tried to strip power from the opposition - led legislature .

She has paid for it with harassment , she said , including a recent hack in which intimate photos of her and her husband were leaked on social media . “ There will no longer be any check on their power , ” she said . “ They will control everything . ” Following an opposition - called 48 - hour strike , the government on Thursday issued a ban on public gatherings and protests lasting from Friday through Tuesday . The opposition responded by calling for nationwide mobilization , <tgr>asking <tgr>citizens to take to the streets from the Caribbean Sea to the Andes Mountains . In an interview , Freddy Guevara , an opposition leader and vice president of the National Assembly , played down the chances of any deal to suspend or cancel the vote .

Scenarios for what happens next range widely . Some observers suggest that social unrest and international sanctions will worsen , prompting , perhaps , a military coup or fueling an anti - government guerrilla movement . Others say the government , likely with the aid of Russia and China , will somehow manage to hold on as the country becomes an international pariah . Still others see a worst - case scenario of social implosion and anarchy . “ Somalia , ” <tgr>said <tgr>Henrique Capriles , an opposition leader and governor of the state of Miranda . “ We could become a failed state . ” Mariana Zuñiga contributed to this report .

The British - Pakistani , who police are not naming for operational reasons , was also a recognized Islamic State follower in the streets around his home in the east London district of Barking , where he tried to recruit children and proselytized openly in a nearby park , sparking a complaint to the police by a local resident . The 27 - year - old , father of at least two young children , appeared also in a television documentary last year in which he was pictured unfurling an Islamic State banner and later arguing with police during a London protest organized by radical preacher Anjem Choudary , a convicted IS recruiter . Last month , community and mosque leaders in Manchester and neighbors of Salman Abedi , the British - Libyan who carried out the May 22 concert bombing in the city , accused the security services of missing several opportunities to identify him as a high - risk militant . FILE - A police officer stands outside Didsbury mosque in Manchester , Britain , May 24 , 2017 . At least five times locals warned the police of their fears about the 22 - year - old suicide bomber . One community worker said he contacted authorities after Abedi said being a suicide bomber was OK .

She said : What we ’ re thinking , based on the symptoms , is that it could be an instance of complicated cases of chikungunya . She also dismissed the rumours that the disease might be ebola , saying that as far as she was aware none of the victims had any contact whatsoever with anyone from Africa . Landaeta also called on Venezuelans to think critically , and to not fall into a “ collective panic ” regarding these diseases .

She left open the option for his lawyer to seek his pretrial release if he were to find living arrangements . Matanov ' s involvement An FBI agent who had worked on his case acknowledged under cross - examination by defense attorney Edward Hayden that Matanov , who lived in Quincy , Massachusetts , had shown up at a local police station the morning of April 19 , 2013 , while a manhunt was under way for suspected bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev , to identify the man , but that the FBI had not interviewed him until the next day . Hayden noted that charging papers pointed out that Matanov had dinner with the suspected bombers , Dzhokhar and his brother , Tamerlan Tsarnaev , the night of the attack and discussed the incident . Hayden asked FBI Special Agent Timothy McElroy undercross - examination if there was any evidence that Matanov at the time had suspected the Tsarnaevs of being involved in the attack . "" There ' s nothing in here , no , "" said McElroy , consulting court papers . Pending charges Prosecutors said Matanov deleted searches related to the attacks from his computer and tried to dispose of cell phones he described as illegal after the FBI released photos of the suspected bombers on April 18 , 2013 . Matanov was brought into court on Wednesday handcuffed and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit . His attorney said he entered the United States in 2010 on a student visa and was later granted political asylum due to ethnic clashes in his native Kyrgyzstan ."

Collapsed ceasefire In terms of furthering its cause among nationalists , the IRA ' s decision to carry out the Bloody Friday attacks proved to be a disaster . Earlier in the year , the IRA had experienced a massive propaganda and recruitment boost after the Parachute Regiment killed 13 protesters during Bloody Sunday in Derry . Many joined believing that they had no other way to defend their communities . It required only one man with a loud hailer to clear each target area in no time . Former IRA leader Sean MacStiofain By June , the organisation felt confident enough to call a ceasefire and hold secret talks with British ministers in London . Those talks came to nothing and the ceasefire collapsed . Bloody Friday was part of a deliberate decision to ratchet up a campaign and make normal life impossible . But after causing the deaths , the IRA tried to blame the security forces for failing to act on warnings . Ultimately Bloody Friday revealed a side to the organisation that many who had joined in the wake of Bloody Sunday had not wished to acknowledge . Within 10 days of the attacks , the army moved in to the Bogside area of Derry to take control of a part of the city that had become out - of - bounds , marking the beginning of a long war of attrition by both sides . Denials In later years , an IRA leader at the time , Sean MacStiofain , said that the aim of the Bloody Friday attacks had been to cause financial damage - but he still refused to accept responsibility . "" It required only one man with a loud hailer to clear each target area in no time , "" he said . "" Republicans were convinced that the British had deliberately disregarded these two warnings for strategic policy reasons . "" Bloody Friday was by no means the last atrocity of 1972 .

Though no claim of responsibility was made , the attack is widely believed to have been carried out by the armed Basque separatist group ETA . == Background == The Rolando Cafe was located on 4 Calle del Correo in Madrid , close to the General Directorate of Security , the headquarters of the Spanish Police . It was regularly frequented by members of the police force and security services . == The attack == The bomb was placed at the entrance to the building and exploded on a Friday afternoon , during a busy lunchtime period . More than 300 people were eating in the neighbouring El Tobogan restaurant at the time of the explosion , two of whom were among the dead . The explosion caused significant damage to nearby buildings , shattering the windows of the nearby General Directorate of Security , while two cars parked nearby were totally destroyed .

This caused tensions within the group , with some members believing that the organisation had to admit responsibility for attacks carried out , even if the results were not those intended .
