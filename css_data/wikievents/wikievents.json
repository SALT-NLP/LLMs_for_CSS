The court on Tuesday indicted Bilal Mohammed and Mieraili Yusufu on 10 counts connected to the blast , including conspiracy to explode bombs and commit premeditated murder . Thailand authorities have not officially named the bombing of Erawan Shrine an act of terror , and accordingly neither suspect was charged specifically with terrorism . Police issued 17 arrest warrants following the <tgr>bombing <tgr>but only Bilal and Mieraili have been detained . They are described as ethnic Uighurs , a minority group based in China ' s Xinjiang region . They have been held in custody since their arrests in late August and early September . Thai officials have said the blast was carried out by a people - smuggling gang seeking revenge on Thai authorities for cracking down on their operation . The August 17 blast at the Erawan Shrine - a popular tourist destination - was one of the most deadly acts of violence in Bangkok in decades , and left 20 people dead and more than 120 injured . Of the dead , 14 were tourists . The attack shocked the residents of the capital because of the apparent randomness , which drove home the point that no place is immune to acts of terror . Authorities , however , have declined to call it an act of terrorism out of apparent fear that it would hurt the country ' s huge tourism industry . Police initially appeared at first to be at a loss , but soon claimed success with a series of raids and two arrests . Arrest warrants have been issued for 15 others . The two suspects were brought to the court in handcuffs wearing brown prison garb . Members of the media were not allowed to enter the court and the indictments took place before the two suspects arrived , said defense lawyer Chuchart Kanpai . Doubts about motive","276":"The court on Tuesday indicted Bilal Mohammed and Mieraili Yusufu on 10 counts connected to the blast , including conspiracy to explode bombs and commit premeditated murder . Thailand authorities have not officially named the bombing of Erawan Shrine an act of terror , and accordingly neither suspect was charged specifically with terrorism . Police issued 17 arrest warrants following the bombing but only Bilal and Mieraili have been detained . They are described as ethnic Uighurs , a minority group based in China ' s Xinjiang region . They have been held in custody since their arrests in late August and early September . Thai officials have said the blast was carried out by a people - smuggling gang seeking revenge on Thai authorities for cracking down on their operation .

But Thai officials reject any political or religious motive , sticking to the theory that it was a revenge for disrupting a human - smuggling gang . Still , skepticism about the police explanation on the shrine attack has abounded because of leaks , contradictions , misstatements and secrecy surrounding the investigation . The two suspects are being tried at a military court on an army base in Bangkok because cases of \u201c national security \u201d have been handled by the military since last May , when the army seized power in a coup from an elected government .","278":"Analysis backs claim drones were used to <tgr>attack <tgr>Venezuela \u2019 s president Analysis of open source information carried out by the investigative website Bellingcat suggests drones that had been repurposed as flying bombs were indeed used in an attack on the president of Venezuela this weekend .

Bellingcat says its analysis supports the government \u2019 s claim that the drone model used was a DJI Matrice 600 , noting that the drones involved in the event each had six rotors . It also points to a photo of drone wreckage which appears to show the distinctive silver rotor tip of the model , although it also notes the drones appear to have had their legs removed . Venezuela \u2019 s interior minister , Nestor Reverol , also claimed the government thwarted the attack using \" special techniques and [ radio ] signal inhibitors \" , which \" disoriented \" the drone that detonated closest to the presidential stand \u2014 a capability Bellingcat notes the Venezuelan security services are reported to have . The second drone was said by Reverol to have \" lost control \" and crashed into a nearby building . Bellingcat <tgr>says <tgr>it is possible to geolocate the video of the falling drone to the same location as the fire in the apartment that firefighters had claimed was caused by a gas canister explosion . It adds that images taken of this location during the fire show a hole in the wall of the apartment in the vicinity of where the drone would have crashed . \" It is a very likely possibility that the downed drone subsequently detonated , creating the hole in the wall of this apartment , igniting a fire , and causing the sound of the second explosion which can be heard in Video 2 [ of the state TV broadcast of Maduro \u2019 s speech ] , \" it further suggests . Here \u2019 s its conclusion : From the open sources of information available , it appears that an attack took place using two DBIEDs while Maduro was giving a speech . Both the drones appear visually similar to DJI Matrice 600s , with at least one displaying features that are consistent with this model .","293":"The second drone was said by Reverol to have \" lost control \" and crashed into a nearby building .

The second drone crashed and exploded approximately 14 seconds later and 400 meters away from the stage , and is the most likely cause of the fire which the Venezuelan firefighters described . It also considers the claim of attribution by a group on social media , calling itself \" Soldados de Franelas \" ( aka \u2018 T - Shirt Soldiers \u2019 \u2014 a reference to a technique used by protestors wrapping a t - shirt around their head to cover their face and protect their identity ) , suggesting it \u2019 s not clear from the group \u2019 s Twitter messages that they are \" unequivocally claiming responsibility for the event \" , owing to use of passive language , and to a claim that the drones were shot down by government snipers \u2014 which it says \" does not appear to be supported by the open source information available \" .","294":"A wave of <tgr>attacks <tgr>across Iraq on Monday killed 107 people in the country ' s deadliest day in more than two years after al - Qaida warned it would mount new attacks and sought to retake territory .
