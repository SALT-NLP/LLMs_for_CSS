The Obama administration has insisted that drone strikes are so “ exceptionally surgical and precise ” that they pluck off terror suspects while not putting “ innocent men , women and children in danger ” . This claim has been contested by numerous human rights groups , however , and the Bureau ’ s figures on civilian casualties also demonstrate that this is often not the case . The White House released long - awaited figures last July on the number of people killed in drone strikes between January 2009 and the end of 2015 , an announcement which insiders said was a direct response to pressure from the Bureau and other organisations that collect data .

Early Sunday , posts on social media from people in New York showed the area of the explosion to be relatively calm and quiet . Authorities had closed large swaths of roads in the area Saturday night . On Sunday , several roads had reopened but there remained a large police presence in the area . The explosion in New York comes as foreign leaders , including many heads of state , are heading to Manhattan for the United Nations General Assembly . Secretary of State John F . Kerry arrived Saturday , while Obama is scheduled to head to the city on Monday . This annual <tgr>meeting <tgr>— held more than two miles from the site of the explosion in Chelsea — is traditionally a challenging time for New York , as many roads are shut down and the heavy security leads to traffic jams . The FBI still has no determination as to motive , said a law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing . Agents are examining the detonated material from the first device as well as studying the second , which appeared to resemble a pressure cooker . They are also looking at video from security cameras , social media — “ all the logical leads , ” the official said . The explosion in Chelsea coincided with a separate attack that took place in Minnesota Saturday night , in which a man stabbed eight people in a St . Cloud mall before he was killed by an off - duty police officer . On Sunday , an ISIS - linked news agency claimed the mall attacker was “ a soldier of the Islamic State . ” An FBI spokesman said in an emailed statement that the agency had not determined whether the stabbings were related to the bombing in Manhattan the same night ."

In late february the White House established a new task force housed in the Department of Justice to apply the lessons learned from years of dealing with so - called improvised explosive devices — some large and powerful and others more limited in scope like the ones apparently set off on Boylston Street yesterday . “ The threat from IED use is likely to remain high in the near future , and will continue to evolve in response to our abilities to counter them , ’’ according to a new strategy approved by President Obama on February 26 . “ A whole - of - government approach that integrates Federal , state , local , tribal , territorial , private sector , and global participation in counter - IED activities will best position the United States to discover plots to use IEDs in the United States , or against U . S . persons abroad , before those threats become imminent . ’’ Advertisement"

The investigators are particularly interested in any contacts the elder brother , Tamerlan Tsarnaev , might have had with Islamic extremists during a six - month visit to Dagestan and Chechnya last year . U . S . lawmakers discussed the same trip Tuesday as they raised concerns about the sharing of intelligence among federal law enforcement agencies . Senator Lindsey Graham said the FBI told him it was not aware at the time of Tamerlan Tsarnaev ' s trip to Russia . Tamerlan Tsarnaev died after a shootout with police last Thursday , while his younger brother Dzhokhar was captured a day later .

The court on Tuesday indicted Bilal Mohammed and Mieraili Yusufu on 10 counts connected to the blast , including conspiracy to explode bombs and commit premeditated murder . Thailand authorities have not officially named the bombing of Erawan Shrine an act of terror , and accordingly neither suspect was charged specifically with terrorism . Police issued 17 arrest warrants following the <tgr>bombing <tgr>but only Bilal and Mieraili have been detained .

The Venezuelan government claimed three days ago that an attempt had been made to assassinate President Nicolás Maduro using two drones loaded with explosives . The president had been giving a speech which was being broadcast live on television when the incident occurred . Initial video from a state - owned television network showed the reaction of Maduro , those around him and a parade of soldiers at the event to what appeared to be two blasts somewhere off camera . But the footage did not include shots of any drones or explosions . AP also reported that firefighters at scene had shed doubt on the drone attack claim — suggesting there had instead been a gas explosion in a nearby flat . Since then more footage has emerged , including videos purporting to show a drone exploding and a drone tumbling alongside a building . Bellingcat has carried out an analysis of publicly available information related to the attack , including syncing timings of the state broadcast of Maduro ’ s speech , and using frame - by - frame analysis combined with photos and satellite imagery of Caracas to try to pinpoint locations of additional footage that has emerged to determine whether the drone attack claim stands up . The Venezuelan government has claimed the drones used were DJI Matrice 600s , each carrying approximately 1kg of C4 plastic explosive and , when detonated , capable of causing damage at a radius of around 50 meters . DJI Matrice 600 drones are a commercial model , normally used for industrial work — with a U .

The president had been giving a <tgr>speech <tgr>which was being broadcast live on television when the incident occurred . Initial video from a state - owned television network showed the reaction of Maduro , those around him and a parade of soldiers at the event to what appeared to be two blasts somewhere off camera . But the footage did not include shots of any drones or explosions . AP also reported that firefighters at scene had shed doubt on the drone attack claim — suggesting there had instead been a gas explosion in a nearby flat . Since then more footage has emerged , including videos purporting to show a drone exploding and a drone tumbling alongside a building . Bellingcat has carried out an analysis of publicly available information related to the attack , including syncing timings of the state broadcast of Maduro ’ s speech , and using frame - by - frame analysis combined with photos and satellite imagery of Caracas to try to pinpoint locations of additional footage that has emerged to determine whether the drone attack claim stands up . The Venezuelan government has claimed the drones used were DJI Matrice 600s , each carrying approximately 1kg of C4 plastic explosive and , when detonated , capable of causing damage at a radius of around 50 meters . DJI Matrice 600 drones are a commercial model , normally used for industrial work — with a U . S . price tag of around $ 5 , 000 apiece , suggesting the attack could have cost little over $ 10k to carry out — with 1kg of plastic explosive available commercially ( for demolition purposes ) at a cost of around $ 30 . Bellingcat says its analysis supports the government ’ s claim that the drone model used was a DJI Matrice 600 , noting that the drones involved in the event each had six rotors ."
