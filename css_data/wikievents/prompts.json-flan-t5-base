In Monday ' s deadliest attack -- a string of roadside bombs and a car bomb followed by a suicide attack targeting emergency responders in the town of Taji -- at least 42 people were killed and 40 wounded , according to two medical officials . \" I heard explosions in the distance so I left my house and I saw a car outside , \" said 40 - year - old Taji resident Abu Mohammed , who added that police inspectors concluded the vehicle was a car bomb . \" We asked the neighbors to leave their houses , but when they were leaving , the bomb went off . \" Abu Mohammed said he witnessed the deaths of an elderly woman carrying a newborn baby and of the policeman who had first concluded the car was packed with explosives . An Agence France Presse reporter at the scene said a row of houses were completely <tgr>destroyed <tgr>, and residents were rummaging through the rubble in search of victims and their belongings . In Baghdad , meanwhile , a car bomb outside a government office responsible for producing identity papers in the Shiite bastion of Sadr City killed at least 12 people and wounded 22 others , security and medical officials said . \" This attack is a terrible crime against humanity , because they did it during Ramadan , while people are fasting , \" said one elderly witness who declined to be identified . An AFP journalist said eight nearby cars were badly burned and many of the victims of the 9 : 30 am ( 0630 GMT ) attack could not be identified because their papers were inside the offices that were targeted . Two other explosions in the Baghdad neighborhoods of Husseiniyah and Yarmouk killed at least four people and left 24 others wounded , while a car bomb in the town of Tarmiyah , just north of Baghdad , hurt nine people , officials said . \n\n{'Attacker': 'BLANK', 'Target': 'BLANK', 'Instrument': 'BLANK', 'ExplosiveDevice': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

    "26": "He spoke only once , when U . S . District Judge Richard Berman asked him to confirm that he intended to plead not guilty to an eight - count indictment filed on Wednesday . \" Yes , sir , \" Rahimi said . Prosecutors have accused the Afghan - born U . S . citizen of setting off an explosion in Manhattan ' s Chelsea neighborhood on Sept . 17 . It did not kill anyone but hurt 30 people . The attack came hours after authorities say another pipe bomb planted by Rahimi went off along the course of a charity road race in New Jersey , although that detonation did not injure anyone . Federal prosecutors also say Rahimi left another bomb in Chelsea that did not go off and several explosive devices in a bag at a train station in Elizabeth , New Jersey . In addition to the New York indictment , Rahimi faces charges from federal and state prosecutors in New Jersey . He was captured after a manhunt that ended when police officers discovered him sleeping in the doorway of a bar in Linden , New Jersey . The confrontation left him with several gunshot wounds , delaying the filing of federal charges and forcing him to make his first court appearance in New Jersey from a hospital bed . Assistant U . S . Attorney Nicholas Lewin told Berman that prosecutors had compiled video clips showing Rahimi ' s movements on the day of the bombings , including leaving his house carrying bags , walking on West 23rd Street where the device went off and planting the second bomb on West 27th Street . He also said the government has records showing Rahimi <tgr>purchased <tgr>bomb components online and DNA evidence tying him to the bombs . Lewin asked Berman to consider a trial date in the \" late winter \" or \" early spring , \" saying the amount of evidence in the case is relatively limited . Berman scheduled court dates for Dec . 19 and Jan . 31 but has not set a trial date . Rahimi ' s court - appointed defense lawyers declined to comment after the hearing . \n\n{'Giver': 'BLANK', 'Recipient': 'BLANK', 'AcquiredEntity': 'BLANK', 'PaymentBarter': 'BLANK', 'Beneficiary': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

There was no warning and the bomb exploded at 9 : 20 , injuring 23 civilians and 10 off - duty soldiers . The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby . Some of the injuries were very serious , with at least three soldiers losing limbs . The blast blew the roof off the pub in the process .

    "34": "The August 17 blast at the Erawan Shrine - a popular tourist destination - was one of the most deadly acts of violence in Bangkok in decades , and left 20 people dead and more than 120 injured . Of the dead , 14 were tourists . The attack shocked the residents of the capital because of the apparent randomness , which drove home the point that no place is immune to acts of terror . Authorities , however , have declined to call it an act of terrorism out of apparent fear that it would hurt the country ' s huge tourism industry . Police initially appeared at first to be at a loss , but soon claimed success with a series of raids and two arrests . Arrest warrants have been issued for 15 others . The two suspects were brought to the court in handcuffs wearing brown prison garb . Members of the media were not allowed to enter the court and the indictments took place before the two suspects arrived , said defense lawyer Chuchart Kanpai . Doubts about motive Early speculation about the bombing had suggested it might be the work of Uighur separatists who were angry that Thailand in July forcibly <tgr>repatriated <tgr>more than 100 Uighurs to China , where it is feared they face persecution . The theory was bolstered by the fact that the Erawan Shrine is popular among Chinese tourists , who figured prominently among the victims of the bombing . But Thai officials reject any political or religious motive , sticking to the theory that it was a revenge for disrupting a human - smuggling gang . Still , skepticism about the police explanation on the shrine attack has abounded because of leaks , contradictions , misstatements and secrecy surrounding the investigation . The two suspects are being tried at a military court on an army base in Bangkok because cases of “ national security ” have been handled by the military since last May , when the army seized power in a coup from an elected government . Former National Police Chief Somyot Poomphanmuang said before his retirement in September that the case against the two suspects was supported by closed - circuit television footage , witnesses , DNA matching and physical evidence , in addition to their confessions . \n\n{'Transporter': 'BLANK', 'PassengerArtifact': 'BLANK', 'Vehicle': 'BLANK', 'Origin': 'BLANK', 'Destination': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

    "47": "Obama embraced the US drone programme , overseeing more strikes in his first year than Bush carried out during his entire presidency . A total of 563 strikes , largely by drones , targeted Pakistan , Somalia and Yemen during Obama ’ s two terms , compared to 57 strikes under Bush . Between 384 and 807 civilians were killed in those countries , according to reports logged by the Bureau . The use of drones aligned with Obama ’ s ambition to keep up the war against al Qaeda while extricating the US military from intractable , costly ground wars in the Middle East and Asia . But the targeted killing programme has drawn much criticism . The Obama administration has insisted that drone strikes are so “ exceptionally surgical and precise ” that they pluck off terror suspects while not putting “ innocent men , women and children in danger ” . This claim has been contested by numerous human rights groups , however , and the Bureau ’ s figures on civilian casualties also demonstrate that this is often not the case . The White House released long - awaited figures last July on the number of people killed in drone strikes between January 2009 and the end of 2015 , an announcement which insiders said was a direct response to pressure from the Bureau and other organisations that collect data . However the US ’ s estimate of the number of civilians <tgr>killed <tgr>– between 64 and 116 – contrasted strongly with the number recorded by the Bureau , which at 380 to 801 was six times higher . That figure does not include deaths in active battlefields including Afghanistan – where US air attacks have shot up since Obama withdrew the majority of his troops at the end of 2014 . The country has since come under frequent US bombardment , in an unreported war that saw 1 , 337 weapons dropped last year alone – a 40 % rise on 2015 . Afghan civilian casualties have been high , with the United Nations ( UN ) reporting at least 85 deaths in 2016 . The Bureau recorded 65 to 105 civilian deaths during this period . We did not start collecting data on Afghanistan until 2015 . \n\n{'Victim': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK', 'Killer': 'BLANK', 'MedicalIssue': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

In Baghdad , meanwhile , a car bomb outside a government office responsible for producing identity papers in the Shiite bastion of Sadr City <tgr>killed <tgr>at least 12 people and wounded 22 others , security and medical officials said . \" This attack is a terrible crime against humanity , because they did it during Ramadan , while people are fasting , \" said one elderly witness who declined to be identified . An AFP journalist said eight nearby cars were badly burned and many of the victims of the 9 : 30 am ( 0630 GMT ) attack could not be identified because their papers were inside the offices that were targeted . Two other explosions in the Baghdad neighborhoods of Husseiniyah and Yarmouk killed at least four people and left 24 others wounded , while a car bomb in the town of Tarmiyah , just north of Baghdad , hurt nine people , officials said .

There was no warning and the bomb exploded at 9 : 20 , injuring 23 civilians and 10 off - duty soldiers . The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby . Some of the injuries were very serious , with at least three soldiers losing limbs . The blast blew the roof off the pub in the process . This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign ( Phase Two ) in England and the end of the truce with the British Government . The next day , the same IRA unit exploded a bomb in Oxford Street , injuring several people . == Aftermath == One of the police officers in charge of the investigation into the bombing described it as a \" carbon copy \" of the Guildford pub bombings in October 1974 for which four people were already serving their sentences .

    "52": "Taliban representatives have met several times with U . S . officials in recent months , but last week threatened to suspend the fledgling process , lambasting Washington for changing the agenda of the talks and \" unilaterally \" adding new subjects . The insurgents have long refused to hold direct talks with the Kabul government -- despite U . S . pleas -- which the Taliban dismisses as a puppet of Washington . In recent years the Afghan government has stopped releasing detailed casualty figures . Last year Ghani has said 28 , 000 Afghan police officers and soldiers have been killed since 2015 , breaking the longstanding suppression on casualty data . Taliban insurgents claimed responsibility for the attack . Zabiullah Mujahid , a spokesman for the hardline terrorist group said they have killed 190 people in the complex attack . Last week , Taliban fighters set off a car bomb outside a highly fortified compound killing at least five people and wounding more than 110 Afghans and expatriates in the capital , Kabul . On Sunday , a suicide bombing in the southeastern province of Logar left eight policemen <tgr>dead <tgr>and another 10 wounded . The Taliban bombing targeted the provincial governor ' s convoy in Mohammad Agha district . The provincial governor and spy chief traveling in the convoy were unharmed . The Taliban have ramped up their attacks on security forces and government facilities in recent months , while Afghan and U . S . troops have increased operations against the militants ' field commanders . Military sources say around 35 members of the country ' s security forces are killed every day in attacks and clashes . This is while the U . S . is still considering a significant troop drawdown in Afghanistan . Around 14 , 000 U . S . troops are stationed in the country , coupled with around 7 , 500 troops from other allied nations , according to RAND , a U . S . government research organization . In a report on Sunday , RAND said that if the U . S . considers \" an early and complete or near - complete departure unrelated to a negotiated peace settlement , \" it could push Afghanistan into a civil war while the Taliban would expand their control throughout the country . \n\n{'Victim': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK', 'Killer': 'BLANK', 'MedicalIssue': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .
