Colombia has asked Cuba to hand over the rebels affiliated with National Liberation Army ( ELN ) , who were in Havana for peace talks , after a deadly car bombing in Bogota was blamed on the group . Conservative President Ivan Duque urged Communist - ruled Cuba , a host and one of the guarantors of the peace process , to send home the ELN rebels in Havana . Cuba ’ s foreign minister said in a tweet late on Friday that the country would respect the protocols of the negotiations it had been hosting and was consulting with both parties and the guarantors of the talks .

The talks were aimed at ending more than five decades of fighting by the Marxist - inspired group . Duque said that Cuba must not protect the rebels . The police academy car bombing “ was a crime that violated human rights and no such act deserves [ Cuba acting ] to avoid justice being done ” , Duque said while giving a speech in Tolima . Colombians , including Duque , planned to join in a march on Sunday to protest against the car bombing , the worst such attack in the country in 16 years . Last rebel group In November , Colombia asked Cuba to capture ELN rebel commander Nicolas Rodriguez and provide information about the presence of other commanders in the Cuban territory . The government in Bogota also asked Havana to act on an Interpol Red Notice against Rodriguez . The Cuban government did not respond publicly to that request or made a statement about the issue . Colombia has experienced several years of relative calm since the 2016 peace accord signed by then - President Juan Manuel Santos and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) fighters . 190118182118648 \n\n{'Attacker': 'BLANK', 'Target': 'BLANK', 'Instrument': 'BLANK', 'ExplosiveDevice': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

    "1": "In February 1975 the Provisional Irish Republican Army agreed to a truce and ceasefire with the British government and the Northern Ireland Office . Seven \" incident centres \" were established in Irish nationalist areas in Northern Ireland to monitor the ceasefire and the activity of the security forces . Before the truce , the IRA active service unit ( ASU ) later dubbed the Balcombe Street Gang ( due to the December 1975 Balcombe Street siege ) had been carrying out bomb and gun attacks in Southern England since autumn 1974 , mostly in and around London . Their last previous attack was an assassination attempt on former Prime Minister Edward Heath but he was not home when the attackers threw a bomb into his bedroom window on 22 December 1974 . == The bombing == The Balcombe Street Gang planted a time bomb in the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham , Surrey . The IRA unit placed the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat . There was no warning and the bomb exploded at 9 : 20 , injuring 23 civilians and 10 off - duty soldiers . The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby . Some of the injuries were very serious , with at least three soldiers losing limbs . The blast blew the roof off the pub in the process . This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign ( Phase Two ) in England and the end of the truce with the British Government . The next day , the same IRA unit <tgr>exploded <tgr>a bomb in Oxford Street , injuring several people . == Aftermath == One of the police officers in charge of the investigation into the bombing described it as a \" carbon copy \" of the Guildford pub bombings in October 1974 for which four people were already serving their sentences . The cell ' s campaign would continue until December 1975 when they were caught at the siege of Balcombe Street . The unit would eventually end up planting close to 50 bombs in London and elsewhere in southern England and carrying out several shootings which , along with the bombings , caused the deaths of nearly 20 people , injured hundreds and caused millions of pounds worth of damage to property . \n\n{'Attacker': 'BLANK', 'Target': 'BLANK', 'Instrument': 'BLANK', 'ExplosiveDevice': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

S . investigators have questioned the parents of the two Boston Marathon bombing suspects in the Russian republic of Dagestan , as they try to determine what might have influenced their sons in the months before the April 15 attack . The American authorities , working with Russian security forces , interviewed both parents Tuesday night and called back the suspects ' mother , Zubeidat Tsarnaev , for more questioning on Wednesday . The investigators are particularly interested in any contacts the elder brother , Tamerlan Tsarnaev , might have had with Islamic extremists during a six - month visit to Dagestan and Chechnya last year . U . S . lawmakers discussed the same trip Tuesday as they raised concerns about the sharing of intelligence among federal law enforcement agencies . Senator Lindsey Graham said the FBI told him it was not aware at the time of Tamerlan Tsarnaev ' s trip to Russia . Tamerlan Tsarnaev died after a shootout with police last Thursday , while his younger brother Dzhokhar was captured a day later . Meanwhile , in Boston , authorities on Wednesday reopened Boylston Street , the city thoroughfare where the <tgr>explosions <tgr>occurred near the finish line of the race . Later , several thousand people gathered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for a memorial service for campus policeman Sean Collier , who authorities say the Tsarnaev brothers shot to death three days after the bombings . Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano told the Senate Intelligence Committee that her agency did know about Tamerlan ' s trip , but that an FBI alert on him had expired by the time he returned . The FBI had interviewed Tsarnaev in 2011 at Russia ' s request , but found nothing to connect him to terrorism at that time . The 19 - year - old Dzhokhar has been charged with using a weapon of mass destruction . He is in federal custody in a Boston hospital . U . S . officials say Dzhokhar told them in preliminary interviews that he and his brother were partly motivated by the U . S . wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , but that they were self - radicalized and not connected to any terrorist network . The two suspects are Chechens who came to the United States as boys . \n\n{'Attacker': 'BLANK', 'Target': 'BLANK', 'Instrument': 'BLANK', 'ExplosiveDevice': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

Still , skepticism about the police explanation on the shrine attack has abounded because of leaks , contradictions , misstatements and secrecy surrounding the investigation . The two suspects are being tried at a military court on an army base in Bangkok because cases of “ national security ” have been handled by the military since last May , when the army seized power in a coup from an elected government . Former National Police Chief Somyot Poomphanmuang said before his retirement in September that the case against the two suspects was supported by closed - circuit television footage , witnesses , DNA matching and physical evidence , in addition to their confessions . Security camera footage from the Erawan Shrine showed a man wearing a yellow T - shirt who sat down on a bench at the outdoor shrine , took off a black backpack and then left it behind as he stood up and walked away . Time stamps on closed circuit TV footage showed he left the shrine just minutes before the blast occurred , during evening rush hour as the area in central Bangkok was filled with people . Police believe that Bilal is the yellow - shirted man who planted the bomb and Yusufu is believed to have <tgr>detonated <tgr>the bomb . Bilal , was initially identified as Adem Karadag , which was the name on a fake Turkish passport in his possession when he was arrested Aug . 29 . He was arrested at one of two apartments police raided on the outskirts of Bangkok . Yusufu was arrested Sept . 1 near the Thai - Cambodia border , carrying a Chinese passport indicating he was from Xinjiang . Police said his DNA and fingerprints were found in both raided apartments , including on a container of gunpowder . Police said they have confessions from the two , and Bilal ' s lawyer says his client admitted planting the deadly bomb at the behest of another suspect who remains a fugitive . He says Bilal was induced to carry out the action by a promise that his emigration to Turkey would be expedited .

Officials said at least 214 people were wounded in 27 different attacks launched in 18 cities , shattering a relative calm which had held in the lead - up to the start on Saturday of the holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan . In Monday ' s deadliest attack -- a string of roadside bombs and a car bomb followed by a suicide attack targeting emergency responders in the town of Taji -- at least 42 people were killed and 40 wounded , according to two medical officials . \" I heard explosions in the distance so I left my house and I saw a car outside , \" said 40 - year - old Taji resident Abu Mohammed , who added that police inspectors concluded the vehicle was a car bomb . \" We asked the neighbors to leave their houses , but when they were leaving , the bomb went off . \" Abu Mohammed said he witnessed the deaths of an elderly woman carrying a newborn baby and of the policeman who had first concluded the car was packed with explosives . An Agence France Presse reporter at the scene said a row of houses were completely destroyed , and residents were rummaging through the rubble in search of victims and their belongings . In Baghdad , meanwhile , a car bomb outside a government office responsible for producing identity papers in the Shiite bastion of Sadr City killed at least 12 people and wounded 22 others , security and medical officials said . \" This attack is a terrible crime against humanity , because they did it during Ramadan , while people are fasting , \" said one elderly witness who declined to be identified . An AFP journalist said eight nearby cars were badly burned and many of the victims of the 9 : 30 am ( 0630 GMT ) attack could not be identified because their papers were inside the offices that were targeted . \n\n{'Attacker': 'BLANK', 'Target': 'BLANK', 'Instrument': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

There were no fatalities but 33 people were injured , some severely . Two off - duty soldiers lost their legs as a result of the bombing . == Background == In February 1975 the Provisional Irish Republican Army agreed to a truce and ceasefire with the British government and the Northern Ireland Office . Seven \" incident centres \" were established in Irish nationalist areas in Northern Ireland to monitor the ceasefire and the activity of the security forces . Before the truce , the IRA active service unit ( ASU ) later dubbed the Balcombe Street Gang ( due to the December 1975 Balcombe Street siege ) had been carrying out bomb and gun attacks in Southern England since autumn 1974 , mostly in and around London . Their last previous attack was an assassination attempt on former Prime Minister Edward Heath but he was not home when the attackers <tgr>threw <tgr>a bomb into his bedroom window on 22 December 1974 . == The bombing == The Balcombe Street Gang planted a time bomb in the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham , Surrey . The IRA unit placed the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat . There was no warning and the bomb exploded at 9 : 20 , injuring 23 civilians and 10 off - duty soldiers . The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby . Some of the injuries were very serious , with at least three soldiers losing limbs . The blast blew the roof off the pub in the process . This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign ( Phase Two ) in England and the end of the truce with the British Government .

The investigators are particularly interested in any contacts the elder brother , Tamerlan Tsarnaev , might have had with Islamic extremists during a six - month visit to Dagestan and Chechnya last year . U . S . lawmakers discussed the same trip Tuesday as they raised concerns about the sharing of intelligence among federal law enforcement agencies . Senator Lindsey Graham said the FBI told him it was not aware at the time of Tamerlan Tsarnaev ' s trip to Russia . Tamerlan Tsarnaev died after a shootout with police last Thursday , while his younger brother Dzhokhar was captured a day later . Meanwhile , in Boston , authorities on Wednesday reopened Boylston Street , the city thoroughfare where the explosions occurred near the finish line of the race . Later , several thousand people gathered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for a memorial service for campus policeman Sean Collier , who authorities say the Tsarnaev brothers shot to death three days after the bombings . Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano told the Senate Intelligence Committee that her agency did know about Tamerlan ' s trip , but that an FBI alert on him had expired by the time he returned . The FBI had interviewed Tsarnaev in 2011 at Russia ' s request , but found nothing to connect him to terrorism at that time . The 19 - year - old Dzhokhar has been charged with using a weapon of mass destruction . He is in federal custody in a Boston hospital . U .

    "24": "Thai Authorities Indict 2 Over August Shrine Attack A Bangkok military court has indicted two men accused of carrying out the August 17 bombing at a popular shrine that killed 20 people . The court on Tuesday indicted Bilal Mohammed and Mieraili Yusufu on 10 counts connected to the blast , including conspiracy to explode bombs and commit premeditated murder . Thailand authorities have not officially named the bombing of Erawan Shrine an act of terror , and accordingly neither suspect was charged specifically with terrorism . Police issued 17 arrest warrants following the bombing but only Bilal and Mieraili have been detained . They are described as ethnic Uighurs , a minority group based in China ' s Xinjiang region . They have been held in custody since their arrests in late August and early September . Thai officials have said the <tgr>blast <tgr>was carried out by a people - smuggling gang seeking revenge on Thai authorities for cracking down on their operation . The August 17 blast at the Erawan Shrine - a popular tourist destination - was one of the most deadly acts of violence in Bangkok in decades , and left 20 people dead and more than 120 injured . Of the dead , 14 were tourists . The attack shocked the residents of the capital because of the apparent randomness , which drove home the point that no place is immune to acts of terror . Authorities , however , have declined to call it an act of terrorism out of apparent fear that it would hurt the country ' s huge tourism industry . Police initially appeared at first to be at a loss , but soon claimed success with a series of raids and two arrests . Arrest warrants have been issued for 15 others . The two suspects were brought to the court in handcuffs wearing brown prison garb . Members of the media were not allowed to enter the court and the indictments took place before the two suspects arrived , said defense lawyer Chuchart Kanpai .

He admitted he was “ appalled and ashamed ” because he claimed the bombing of civilians went against everything it stood for . He said the attacks on The Mulberry Bush and The Tavern in The Town had been in revenge for the death of IRA bomber James McDade . At first he feared that the timing of the attacks - with very little warning - had been deliberate because “ tempers were high ” . But he was later told that the IRA unit involved had tried to use “ a succession of phone boxes ” which were out of order , significantly delaying the bomb - warning call .

    "28": "Accused New York City Bomber Pleads Not Guilty Accused New York bomber Ahmad Khan Rahimi pleaded not guilty on Thursday to federal charges that he <tgr>set off <tgr>an explosive device in September on a crowded city street , injuring 30 people . Wearing a dark blue jump suit , Rahimi , 28 , shuffled slowly into federal court in Manhattan and had several coughing fits during the brief hearing . He suffered serious injuries in a shootout with police two days after the bombing . He spoke only once , when U . S . District Judge Richard Berman asked him to confirm that he intended to plead not guilty to an eight - count indictment filed on Wednesday . \" Yes , sir , \" Rahimi said . Prosecutors have accused the Afghan - born U . S . citizen of setting off an explosion in Manhattan ' s Chelsea neighborhood on Sept . 17 . It did not kill anyone but hurt 30 people . The attack came hours after authorities say another pipe bomb planted by Rahimi went off along the course of a charity road race in New Jersey , although that detonation did not injure anyone . Federal prosecutors also say Rahimi left another bomb in Chelsea that did not go off and several explosive devices in a bag at a train station in Elizabeth , New Jersey . In addition to the New York indictment , Rahimi faces charges from federal and state prosecutors in New Jersey . He was captured after a manhunt that ended when police officers discovered him sleeping in the doorway of a bar in Linden , New Jersey . The confrontation left him with several gunshot wounds , delaying the filing of federal charges and forcing him to make his first court appearance in New Jersey from a hospital bed . Assistant U . S . Attorney Nicholas Lewin told Berman that prosecutors had compiled video clips showing Rahimi ' s movements on the day of the bombings , including leaving his house carrying bags , walking on West 23rd Street where the device went off and planting the second bomb on West 27th Street . He also said the government has records showing Rahimi purchased bomb components online and DNA evidence tying him to the bombs . \n\n{'Attacker': 'BLANK', 'Target': 'BLANK', 'Instrument': 'BLANK', 'ExplosiveDevice': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

    "32": "WASHINGTON — The threat from multiple homemade bombs detonated nearly simultaneously to kill or maim as many civilians as possible has been a hallmark of militant groups in recent years from Iraq to Israel and Afghanistan and Russia . But until Monday at the Boston Marathon finish line in Copley Square , such street - level bombings targeting sidewalk or marketplace crowds had not taken place on American soil . US law enforcement and intelligence officials across the country and overseas , scrambling to identify the source of the explosives , are now worried that the marathon sidewalk bombing could mark a new chapter in the struggle to secure the American homeland . Advertisement “ We ’ ve seen this around the world , but what is so concerning about this is that it hadn ’ t happened here , not like this . Until yesterday , ’’ said a senior homeland security official in Washington . The Boston bombs were packed into pressure cookers and hidden in backpacks or duffel bags , according to multiple press accounts citing unidentified sources , another similarity with some Mideast <tgr>attacks <tgr>using “ improvised explosive devices , ’’ or IEDs . One of the bombs used in a foiled attack in New York ’ s Times Square in 2010 was fashioned from a pressure cooker . A joint warning issued by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security in 2010 said pressure cookers has been used for bombs in multiple attacks in Afghanistan , Pakistan , India , and Nepal . Reports from medical staff at Boston hospitals who treated victims in the marathon attack indicate the bombs in this case were packed with BB ’ s , nails , and other projectiles intended to maximize human carnage . That contrasts with the large truck bombs that were used in Oklahoma City in 1995 and in the garage of the World Trade Center North Tower in 1993 , which were intended to inflict damage on buildings , as well as people . IED ’ s pack a much smaller punch , are cheaper , and easier to carry . They have been used in Iraq and Afghanistan with devastating effect on American troops in convoys of military vehicles .

There were no fatalities but 33 people were injured , some severely . Two off - duty soldiers lost their legs as a result of the bombing . == Background == In February 1975 the Provisional Irish Republican Army agreed to a truce and ceasefire with the British government and the Northern Ireland Office . Seven \" incident centres \" were established in Irish nationalist areas in Northern Ireland to monitor the ceasefire and the activity of the security forces . Before the truce , the IRA active service unit ( ASU ) later dubbed the Balcombe Street Gang ( due to the December 1975 Balcombe Street siege ) had been carrying out bomb and gun attacks in Southern England since autumn 1974 , mostly in and around London . Their last previous attack was an assassination attempt on former Prime Minister Edward Heath but he was not home when the attackers threw a bomb into his bedroom window on 22 December 1974 . == The bombing == The Balcombe Street Gang planted a time bomb in the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham , Surrey . The IRA unit placed the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat . There was no warning and the bomb exploded at 9 : 20 , injuring 23 civilians and 10 off - duty soldiers . The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby . Some of the injuries were very serious , with at least three soldiers losing limbs . The blast blew the roof off the pub in the process . This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign ( Phase Two ) in England and the end of the truce with the British Government . The next day , the same IRA unit exploded a bomb in Oxford Street , injuring several people . == Aftermath == \n\n{'Attacker': 'BLANK', 'Target': 'BLANK', 'Instrument': 'BLANK', 'ExplosiveDevice': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

    "36": "The second drone was said by Reverol to have \" lost control \" and crashed into a nearby building . Bellingcat says it is possible to geolocate the video of the falling drone to the same location as the fire in the apartment that firefighters had claimed was caused by a gas canister explosion . It adds that images taken of this location during the fire show a hole in the wall of the apartment in the vicinity of where the drone would have crashed . \" It is a very likely possibility that the downed drone subsequently detonated , creating the hole in the wall of this apartment , igniting a fire , and causing the sound of the second explosion which can be heard in Video 2 [ of the state TV broadcast of Maduro ’ s speech ] , \" it further suggests . Here ’ s its conclusion : From the open sources of information available , it appears that an <tgr>attack <tgr>took place using two DBIEDs while Maduro was giving a speech . Both the drones appear visually similar to DJI Matrice 600s , with at least one displaying features that are consistent with this model . These drones appear to have been loaded with explosive and flown towards the parade . The first drone detonated somewhere above or near the parade , the most likely cause of the casualties announced by the Venezuelan government and pictured on social media . The second drone crashed and exploded approximately 14 seconds later and 400 meters away from the stage , and is the most likely cause of the fire which the Venezuelan firefighters described . It also considers the claim of attribution by a group on social media , calling itself \" Soldados de Franelas \" ( aka ‘ T - Shirt Soldiers ’ — a reference to a technique used by protestors wrapping a t - shirt around their head to cover their face and protect their identity ) , suggesting it ’ s not clear from the group ’ s Twitter messages that they are \" unequivocally claiming responsibility for the event \" , owing to use of passive language , and to a claim that the drones were shot down by government snipers — which it says \" does not appear to be supported by the open source information available \" . \n\n{'Attacker': 'BLANK', 'Target': 'BLANK', 'Instrument': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

Neither The Mulberry Bush nor The Tavern in The Town had any military connection . Normal IRA procedure at the time for any attack on non - military targets was to give a 30 - minute warning in order for full evacuations to take place . Read our docudrama minute - by - minute recreation of the events of November 21 1974 The Birmingham Mail received an ambiguous call at 8 . 11pm on November 21 . The caller did not identify either pub , referring instead to The Rotunda , above The Mulberry Bush and the New Street Tax Office , which was above the underground Tavern in The Town . The first bomb <tgr>destroyed <tgr>The Mulberry Bush just six minutes later . The Tavern was destroyed at 8 . 27pm . Conway was not directly involved in the debrief with the England Operational Commander . But he said he was later told “ that the early indications were that the casualties were the result of yet another failure in the warning system , a succession of phone boxes from which the warning might have been relayed having proved to be inoperable . ” In an interview with a national newspaper he described the Birmingham pub bombings as “ a total disaster . ” He added that the secret ‘ Feakle Talks ’ , held a couple of weeks after the bombings , were used by the IRA to try to start to repair its image after the Birmingham and the Guildford pub bombings . The talks , in Feakle , County Clare , involved senior IRA officials and Protestant clergymen and ended abruptly after a tip - off that Irish Special Branch officers were on their way to arrest the republicans . But they set in train a process that eventually led to a brief ceasefire that began on December 22 , 1974 . Conway had been recruited in 1970 , having been radicalised during the 1968 student protest movements . \n\n{'Attacker': 'BLANK', 'Target': 'BLANK', 'Instrument': 'BLANK', 'ExplosiveDevice': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

    "38": "Analysis backs claim drones were used to attack Venezuela ’ s president Analysis of open source information carried out by the investigative website Bellingcat suggests drones that had been repurposed as flying bombs were indeed used in an attack on the president of Venezuela this weekend . The Venezuelan government claimed three days ago that an <tgr>attempt <tgr>had been made to assassinate President Nicolás Maduro using two drones loaded with explosives . The president had been giving a speech which was being broadcast live on television when the incident occurred . Initial video from a state - owned television network showed the reaction of Maduro , those around him and a parade of soldiers at the event to what appeared to be two blasts somewhere off camera . But the footage did not include shots of any drones or explosions . AP also reported that firefighters at scene had shed doubt on the drone attack claim — suggesting there had instead been a gas explosion in a nearby flat . Since then more footage has emerged , including videos purporting to show a drone exploding and a drone tumbling alongside a building . Bellingcat has carried out an analysis of publicly available information related to the attack , including syncing timings of the state broadcast of Maduro ’ s speech , and using frame - by - frame analysis combined with photos and satellite imagery of Caracas to try to pinpoint locations of additional footage that has emerged to determine whether the drone attack claim stands up . The Venezuelan government has claimed the drones used were DJI Matrice 600s , each carrying approximately 1kg of C4 plastic explosive and , when detonated , capable of causing damage at a radius of around 50 meters . DJI Matrice 600 drones are a commercial model , normally used for industrial work — with a U . S . price tag of around $ 5 , 000 apiece , suggesting the attack could have cost little over $ 10k to carry out — with 1kg of plastic explosive available commercially ( for demolition purposes ) at a cost of around $ 30 . Bellingcat says its analysis supports the government ’ s claim that the drone model used was a DJI Matrice 600 , noting that the drones involved in the event each had six rotors . \n\n{'Attacker': 'BLANK', 'Target': 'BLANK', 'Instrument': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

He admitted he was “ appalled and ashamed ” because he claimed the bombing of civilians went against everything it stood for . He said the <tgr>attacks <tgr>on The Mulberry Bush and The Tavern in The Town had been in revenge for the death of IRA bomber James McDade . At first he feared that the timing of the attacks - with very little warning - had been deliberate because “ tempers were high ” .

    "42": "There were ten times more air strikes in the covert war on terror during President Barack Obama ’ s presidency than under his predecessor , George W . Bush . Obama embraced the US drone programme , overseeing more strikes in his first year than Bush carried out during his entire presidency . A total of 563 <tgr>strikes <tgr>, largely by drones , targeted Pakistan , Somalia and Yemen during Obama ’ s two terms , compared to 57 strikes under Bush . Between 384 and 807 civilians were killed in those countries , according to reports logged by the Bureau . The use of drones aligned with Obama ’ s ambition to keep up the war against al Qaeda while extricating the US military from intractable , costly ground wars in the Middle East and Asia . But the targeted killing programme has drawn much criticism . The Obama administration has insisted that drone strikes are so “ exceptionally surgical and precise ” that they pluck off terror suspects while not putting “ innocent men , women and children in danger ” . This claim has been contested by numerous human rights groups , however , and the Bureau ’ s figures on civilian casualties also demonstrate that this is often not the case . The White House released long - awaited figures last July on the number of people killed in drone strikes between January 2009 and the end of 2015 , an announcement which insiders said was a direct response to pressure from the Bureau and other organisations that collect data . However the US ’ s estimate of the number of civilians killed – between 64 and 116 – contrasted strongly with the number recorded by the Bureau , which at 380 to 801 was six times higher . That figure does not include deaths in active battlefields including Afghanistan – where US air attacks have shot up since Obama withdrew the majority of his troops at the end of 2014 . The country has since come under frequent US bombardment , in an unreported war that saw 1 , 337 weapons dropped last year alone – a 40 % rise on 2015 . \n\n{'Attacker': 'BLANK', 'Target': 'BLANK', 'Instrument': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

The Venezuelan government claimed three days ago that an attempt had been made to assassinate President Nicolás Maduro using two drones loaded with explosives .

Since then more footage has emerged , including videos purporting to show a drone exploding and a drone tumbling alongside a building . Bellingcat has carried out an analysis of publicly available information related to the attack , including syncing timings of the state broadcast of Maduro ’ s speech , and using frame - by - frame analysis combined with photos and satellite imagery of Caracas to try to pinpoint locations of additional footage that has emerged to determine whether the drone attack claim stands up . The Venezuelan government has claimed the drones used were DJI Matrice 600s , each carrying approximately 1kg of C4 plastic explosive and , when detonated , capable of causing damage at a radius of around 50 meters .

Their last previous attack was an assassination attempt on former Prime Minister Edward Heath but he was not home when the attackers threw a bomb into his bedroom window on 22 December 1974 . == The bombing == The Balcombe Street Gang planted a time bomb in the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham , Surrey . The IRA unit placed the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat . There was no warning and the bomb exploded at 9 : 20 , injuring 23 civilians and 10 off - duty soldiers . The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby . Some of the injuries were very serious , with at least three soldiers losing limbs . The blast blew the roof off the pub in the process . This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign ( Phase Two ) in England and the end of the truce with the British Government .

    "63": "There were ten times more air strikes in the covert war on terror during President Barack Obama ’ s presidency than under his predecessor , George W . Bush . Obama embraced the US drone programme , overseeing more strikes in his first year than Bush carried out during his entire presidency . A total of 563 strikes , largely by drones , targeted Pakistan , Somalia and Yemen during Obama ’ s two terms , compared to 57 strikes under Bush . Between 384 and 807 civilians were killed in those countries , according to reports logged by the Bureau . The use of drones aligned with Obama ’ s ambition to keep up the war against al Qaeda while extricating the US military from intractable , costly ground wars in the Middle East and Asia . But the targeted killing programme has drawn much criticism . The Obama administration has insisted that drone <tgr>strikes <tgr>are so “ exceptionally surgical and precise ” that they pluck off terror suspects while not putting “ innocent men , women and children in danger ” . This claim has been contested by numerous human rights groups , however , and the Bureau ’ s figures on civilian casualties also demonstrate that this is often not the case . The White House released long - awaited figures last July on the number of people killed in drone strikes between January 2009 and the end of 2015 , an announcement which insiders said was a direct response to pressure from the Bureau and other organisations that collect data . However the US ’ s estimate of the number of civilians killed – between 64 and 116 – contrasted strongly with the number recorded by the Bureau , which at 380 to 801 was six times higher . That figure does not include deaths in active battlefields including Afghanistan – where US air attacks have shot up since Obama withdrew the majority of his troops at the end of 2014 . The country has since come under frequent US bombardment , in an unreported war that saw 1 , 337 weapons dropped last year alone – a 40 % rise on 2015 . \n\n{'Attacker': 'BLANK', 'Target': 'BLANK', 'Instrument': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

    "64": "But until Monday at the Boston Marathon finish line in Copley Square , such street - level bombings targeting sidewalk or marketplace crowds had not taken place on American soil . US law enforcement and intelligence officials across the country and overseas , scrambling to identify the source of the explosives , are now worried that the marathon sidewalk bombing could mark a new chapter in the struggle to secure the American homeland . Advertisement “ We ’ ve seen this around the world , but what is so concerning about this is that it hadn ’ t happened here , not like this . Until yesterday , ’’ said a senior homeland security official in Washington . The Boston bombs were packed into pressure cookers and hidden in backpacks or duffel bags , according to multiple press accounts citing unidentified sources , another similarity with some Mideast attacks using “ improvised explosive devices , ’’ or IEDs . One of the bombs used in a foiled attack in New York ’ s Times Square in 2010 was fashioned from a pressure cooker . A joint warning issued by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security in 2010 said pressure cookers has been used for bombs in multiple <tgr>attacks <tgr>in Afghanistan , Pakistan , India , and Nepal . Reports from medical staff at Boston hospitals who treated victims in the marathon attack indicate the bombs in this case were packed with BB ’ s , nails , and other projectiles intended to maximize human carnage . That contrasts with the large truck bombs that were used in Oklahoma City in 1995 and in the garage of the World Trade Center North Tower in 1993 , which were intended to inflict damage on buildings , as well as people . IED ’ s pack a much smaller punch , are cheaper , and easier to carry . They have been used in Iraq and Afghanistan with devastating effect on American troops in convoys of military vehicles . Advertisement No one has taken responsibility for the twin bombings on Boylston Street that killed three people and injured more than 150 near the Boston marathon finish line . \n\n{'Attacker': 'BLANK', 'Target': 'BLANK', 'Instrument': 'BLANK', 'ExplosiveDevice': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

Andrew Cuomo ( D ) said Sunday that there is “ no evidence of an international terrorism connection ” in the explosion in Chelsea , though he stopped short of saying whoever caused the incident did not want to incite terror . AD “ It depends on your definition of terrorism , ” Cuomo said . “ A bomb <tgr>exploding <tgr>in New York is obviously an act of terrorism , but it ’ s not linked to international terrorism . In other words , we find no ISIS connections . ” AD He said later : “ This is the nightmare scenario . ” Not long after the blast , police said they had found another possible explosive device just blocks away . This device appeared to be similar to a pressure cooker and had wiring on it , according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation . Pressure cookers were used in the two bombs detonated at the Boston Marathon in 2013 . The bomb squad safely removed the second device , New York police tweeted early Sunday . Police officers , firefighters and other first responders had rushed to the scene of the blast , which closed a major roadway and forced people out of nearby buildings . New York Mayor Bill de Blasio ( D ) said Sunday that the explosion was “ intentional , ” but noted that few details were available because the investigation was in its early stages . “ We know there was a bombing , ” de Blasio said . “ We know it was a very serious incident , but we have a lot more work to do to be able to say what kind of motivation was behind this . ” AD AD He also echoed his comments from Saturday night that there was no specific , credible threat against New York from any terrorist group . The FBI and NYPD are trying to understand what motivation lay behind the blast . “ We will look at individuals . We will look at associations . We will look at social media , ” William Sweeney , Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI New York Field Office , said . \n\n{'Attacker': 'BLANK', 'Target': 'BLANK', 'Instrument': 'BLANK', 'ExplosiveDevice': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

Taliban representatives have met several times with U .

The insurgents have long refused to hold direct talks with the Kabul government -- despite U . S . pleas -- which the Taliban dismisses as a puppet of Washington . In recent years the Afghan government has stopped releasing detailed casualty figures . Last year Ghani has said 28 , 000 Afghan police officers and soldiers have been killed since 2015 , breaking the longstanding suppression on casualty data . Taliban insurgents claimed responsibility for the attack . Zabiullah Mujahid , a spokesman for the hardline terrorist group said they have killed 190 people in the complex attack . Last week , Taliban fighters <tgr>set off <tgr>a car bomb outside a highly fortified compound killing at least five people and wounding more than 110 Afghans and expatriates in the capital , Kabul . On Sunday , a suicide bombing in the southeastern province of Logar left eight policemen dead and another 10 wounded . The Taliban bombing targeted the provincial governor ' s convoy in Mohammad Agha district . The provincial governor and spy chief traveling in the convoy were unharmed .

He suffered serious injuries in a shootout with police two days after the bombing . He spoke only once , when U . S . District Judge Richard Berman asked him to confirm that he intended to plead not guilty to an eight - count indictment filed on Wednesday . \" Yes , sir , \" Rahimi said . Prosecutors have accused the Afghan - born U . S . citizen of setting off an explosion in Manhattan ' s Chelsea neighborhood on Sept . 17 . It did not kill anyone but hurt 30 people . The attack came hours after authorities say another pipe bomb planted by Rahimi went off along the course of a charity road race in New Jersey , although that detonation did not injure anyone . Federal prosecutors also say Rahimi left another bomb in Chelsea that did not <tgr>go off <tgr>and several explosive devices in a bag at a train station in Elizabeth , New Jersey . In addition to the New York indictment , Rahimi faces charges from federal and state prosecutors in New Jersey . He was captured after a manhunt that ended when police officers discovered him sleeping in the doorway of a bar in Linden , New Jersey . The confrontation left him with several gunshot wounds , delaying the filing of federal charges and forcing him to make his first court appearance in New Jersey from a hospital bed . Assistant U . S . Attorney Nicholas Lewin told Berman that prosecutors had compiled video clips showing Rahimi ' s movements on the day of the bombings , including leaving his house carrying bags , walking on West 23rd Street where the device went off and planting the second bomb on West 27th Street . He also said the government has records showing Rahimi purchased bomb components online and DNA evidence tying him to the bombs . Lewin asked Berman to consider a trial date in the \" late winter \" or \" early spring , \" saying the amount of evidence in the case is relatively limited . Berman scheduled court dates for Dec . 19 and Jan . 31 but has not set a trial date . \n\n{'Attacker': 'BLANK', 'Target': 'BLANK', 'Instrument': 'BLANK', 'ExplosiveDevice': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

    "74": "Thai Authorities Indict 2 Over August Shrine Attack A Bangkok military court has indicted two men accused of carrying out the August 17 bombing at a popular shrine that killed 20 people . The court on Tuesday indicted Bilal Mohammed and Mieraili Yusufu on 10 counts connected to the blast , including conspiracy to explode bombs and commit premeditated murder . Thailand authorities have not officially named the bombing of Erawan Shrine an act of terror , and accordingly neither suspect was charged specifically with terrorism . Police issued 17 arrest warrants following the bombing but only Bilal and Mieraili have been detained . They are described as ethnic Uighurs , a minority group based in China ' s Xinjiang region . They have been held in custody since their arrests in late August and early September . Thai officials have said the blast was carried out by a people - smuggling gang seeking revenge on Thai authorities for cracking down on their operation . The August 17 <tgr>blast <tgr>at the Erawan Shrine - a popular tourist destination - was one of the most deadly acts of violence in Bangkok in decades , and left 20 people dead and more than 120 injured . Of the dead , 14 were tourists . The attack shocked the residents of the capital because of the apparent randomness , which drove home the point that no place is immune to acts of terror . Authorities , however , have declined to call it an act of terrorism out of apparent fear that it would hurt the country ' s huge tourism industry . Police initially appeared at first to be at a loss , but soon claimed success with a series of raids and two arrests . Arrest warrants have been issued for 15 others .

Members of the media were not allowed to enter the court and the indictments took place before the two suspects arrived , said defense lawyer Chuchart Kanpai . Doubts about motive Early speculation about the bombing had suggested it might be the work of Uighur separatists who were angry that Thailand in July forcibly repatriated more than 100 Uighurs to China , where it is feared they face persecution . The theory was bolstered by the fact that the Erawan Shrine is popular among Chinese tourists , who figured prominently among the victims of the bombing . But Thai officials reject any political or religious motive , sticking to the theory that it was a revenge for disrupting a human - smuggling gang . Still , skepticism about the police explanation on the shrine <tgr>attack <tgr>has abounded because of leaks , contradictions , misstatements and secrecy surrounding the investigation . The two suspects are being tried at a military court on an army base in Bangkok because cases of “ national security ” have been handled by the military since last May , when the army seized power in a coup from an elected government . Former National Police Chief Somyot Poomphanmuang said before his retirement in September that the case against the two suspects was supported by closed - circuit television footage , witnesses , DNA matching and physical evidence , in addition to their confessions . Security camera footage from the Erawan Shrine showed a man wearing a yellow T - shirt who sat down on a bench at the outdoor shrine , took off a black backpack and then left it behind as he stood up and walked away . Time stamps on closed circuit TV footage showed he left the shrine just minutes before the blast occurred , during evening rush hour as the area in central Bangkok was filled with people . Police believe that Bilal is the yellow - shirted man who planted the bomb and Yusufu is believed to have detonated the bomb . \n\n{'Attacker': 'BLANK', 'Target': 'BLANK', 'Instrument': 'BLANK', 'ExplosiveDevice': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

On Sunday , a <tgr>suicide bombing <tgr>in the southeastern province of Logar left eight policemen dead and another 10 wounded . The Taliban bombing targeted the provincial governor ' s convoy in Mohammad Agha district . The provincial governor and spy chief traveling in the convoy were unharmed .

Wearing a dark blue jump suit , Rahimi , 28 , shuffled slowly into federal court in Manhattan and had several coughing fits during the brief hearing . He suffered serious injuries in a shootout with police two days after the bombing . He spoke only once , when U . S . District Judge Richard Berman asked him to confirm that he intended to plead not guilty to an eight - count indictment filed on Wednesday . \" Yes , sir , \" Rahimi said . Prosecutors have accused the Afghan - born U . S . citizen of setting off an explosion in Manhattan ' s Chelsea neighborhood on Sept . 17 . It did not kill anyone but hurt 30 people . The <tgr>attack <tgr>came hours after authorities say another pipe bomb planted by Rahimi went off along the course of a charity road race in New Jersey , although that detonation did not injure anyone . Federal prosecutors also say Rahimi left another bomb in Chelsea that did not go off and several explosive devices in a bag at a train station in Elizabeth , New Jersey . In addition to the New York indictment , Rahimi faces charges from federal and state prosecutors in New Jersey . He was captured after a manhunt that ended when police officers discovered him sleeping in the doorway of a bar in Linden , New Jersey . The confrontation left him with several gunshot wounds , delaying the filing of federal charges and forcing him to make his first court appearance in New Jersey from a hospital bed . Assistant U . S . Attorney Nicholas Lewin told Berman that prosecutors had compiled video clips showing Rahimi ' s movements on the day of the bombings , including leaving his house carrying bags , walking on West 23rd Street where the device went off and planting the second bomb on West 27th Street . He also said the government has records showing Rahimi purchased bomb components online and DNA evidence tying him to the bombs . \n\n{'Attacker': 'BLANK', 'Target': 'BLANK', 'Instrument': 'BLANK', 'ExplosiveDevice': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

    "84": "Thai Authorities Indict 2 Over August Shrine <tgr>Attack <tgr>A Bangkok military court has indicted two men accused of carrying out the August 17 bombing at a popular shrine that killed 20 people . The court on Tuesday indicted Bilal Mohammed and Mieraili Yusufu on 10 counts connected to the blast , including conspiracy to explode bombs and commit premeditated murder . Thailand authorities have not officially named the bombing of Erawan Shrine an act of terror , and accordingly neither suspect was charged specifically with terrorism . Police issued 17 arrest warrants following the bombing but only Bilal and Mieraili have been detained . They are described as ethnic Uighurs , a minority group based in China ' s Xinjiang region . They have been held in custody since their arrests in late August and early September . Thai officials have said the blast was carried out by a people - smuggling gang seeking revenge on Thai authorities for cracking down on their operation . The August 17 blast at the Erawan Shrine - a popular tourist destination - was one of the most deadly acts of violence in Bangkok in decades , and left 20 people dead and more than 120 injured . Of the dead , 14 were tourists . The attack shocked the residents of the capital because of the apparent randomness , which drove home the point that no place is immune to acts of terror . Authorities , however , have declined to call it an act of terrorism out of apparent fear that it would hurt the country ' s huge tourism industry . Police initially appeared at first to be at a loss , but soon claimed success with a series of raids and two arrests . Arrest warrants have been issued for 15 others .

Tokyo metropolitan police said Yasuo Yamamoto , 40 , turned himself in to authorities late Friday in Fukui in western Japan . The small drone found Wednesday had traces of radiation and triggered fears of potential terrorist <tgr>attacks <tgr>using unmanned aerial devices , the prime ministers ' office has said . The infiltration at Japan ' s political headquarters has also raised questions over the level of security there . No one was injured and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was traveling at the time of the incident . Police said Yamamoto was arrested on suspicion of flying the drone and obstructing duties at the prime minister ' s office . He has not been indicted and faces further questioning . Public broadcaster NHK said police quoted the unemployed man as saying he did it to protest the government ' s nuclear energy policy . Fukui is home to about a quarter of Japan ' s 48 reactors , which are currently all offline following the 2011 tsunami - triggered Fukushima plant disaster . Abe ' s administration wants to restart as many of the idled plants as possible . The drone was carrying a small camera and a plastic bottle containing what police suspect was the source of radioactive cesium , levels of which were too low to affect humans or the environment . The suspect said he used the sand from an unspecified location in Fukushima , where radiation levels are still high due to fallouts from the Fukushima Dai - ichi meltdowns , NHK said . The government has set up a task force to work on regulations for the use of small drones while ensuring the security of key government facilities . Drones have become increasingly popular in Japan for industrial , service and entertainment use . At a meeting Friday , task force members cautioned against excessive restrictions on the emerging market for drones . \n\n{'Attacker': 'BLANK', 'Target': 'BLANK', 'Instrument': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

Bellingcat says it is possible to geolocate the video of the falling drone to the same location as the fire in the apartment that firefighters had claimed was caused by a gas canister explosion . It adds that images taken of this location during the fire show a hole in the wall of the apartment in the vicinity of where the drone would have crashed . \" It is a very likely possibility that the downed drone subsequently detonated , creating the hole in the wall of this apartment , igniting a fire , and causing the sound of the second explosion which can be heard in Video 2 [ of the state TV broadcast of Maduro ’ s speech ] , \" it further suggests . Here ’ s its conclusion : From the open sources of information available , it appears that an attack took place using two DBIEDs while Maduro was giving a speech . Both the drones appear visually similar to DJI Matrice 600s , with at least one displaying features that are consistent with this model . These drones appear to have been loaded with explosive and flown towards the parade . The first drone detonated somewhere above or near the parade , the most likely cause of the casualties <tgr>announced <tgr>by the Venezuelan government and pictured on social media . The second drone crashed and exploded approximately 14 seconds later and 400 meters away from the stage , and is the most likely cause of the fire which the Venezuelan firefighters described .

The Venezuelan government claimed three days ago that an attempt had been made to assassinate President Nicolás Maduro using two drones loaded with explosives . The president had been giving a <tgr>speech <tgr>which was being broadcast live on television when the incident occurred . Initial video from a state - owned television network showed the reaction of Maduro , those around him and a parade of soldiers at the event to what appeared to be two blasts somewhere off camera . But the footage did not include shots of any drones or explosions . AP also reported that firefighters at scene had shed doubt on the drone attack claim — suggesting there had instead been a gas explosion in a nearby flat . Since then more footage has emerged , including videos purporting to show a drone exploding and a drone tumbling alongside a building . Bellingcat has carried out an analysis of publicly available information related to the attack , including syncing timings of the state broadcast of Maduro ’ s speech , and using frame - by - frame analysis combined with photos and satellite imagery of Caracas to try to pinpoint locations of additional footage that has emerged to determine whether the drone attack claim stands up . The Venezuelan government has claimed the drones used were DJI Matrice 600s , each carrying approximately 1kg of C4 plastic explosive and , when detonated , capable of causing damage at a radius of around 50 meters . DJI Matrice 600 drones are a commercial model , normally used for industrial work — with a U . S . price tag of around $ 5 , 000 apiece , suggesting the attack could have cost little over $ 10k to carry out — with 1kg of plastic explosive available commercially ( for demolition purposes ) at a cost of around $ 30 . Bellingcat says its analysis supports the government ’ s claim that the drone model used was a DJI Matrice 600 , noting that the drones involved in the event each had six rotors . \n\n{'Communicator': 'BLANK', 'Recipient': 'BLANK', 'Instrument': 'BLANK', 'Topic': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

District Judge George O ' Toole Jr . began to speak , with his voice breaking several times . He officially imposed the death sentence on Tsarnaev that jurors had recommended unanimously . In May , after a 12 - week trial , Tsarnaev was found guilty of killing three people and injuring 264 in the April 15 , 2013 , bombing at the world - renowned race , where he and his brother , Tamerlan , 26 , set off two pressure - cooker bombs near the finish line . Tsarnaev was also found guilty in the fatal shooting of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer three days later as he and his brother fled . Tamerlan was killed during the getaway . Tsarnaev was found guilty of all 30 terrorism and other charges against him . Of those , 17 carried the possibility of a death sentence . During the penalty phase of the judicial proceedings , prosecutors brushed off defense arguments that Tsarnaev was under the strong influence of his older , radicalized brother .

It also points to a photo of drone wreckage which appears to show the distinctive silver rotor tip of the model , although it also notes the drones appear to have had their legs removed . Venezuela ’ s interior minister , Nestor Reverol , also claimed the government thwarted the attack using \" special techniques and [ radio ] signal inhibitors \" , which \" <tgr>disoriented <tgr>\" the drone that detonated closest to the presidential stand — a capability Bellingcat notes the Venezuelan security services are reported to have .

It adds that images taken of this location during the fire show a hole in the wall of the apartment in the vicinity of where the drone would have crashed . \" It is a very likely possibility that the downed drone subsequently detonated , creating the hole in the wall of this apartment , igniting a fire , and causing the sound of the second explosion which can be heard in Video 2 [ of the state TV broadcast of Maduro ’ s speech ] , \" it further suggests .

The small drone found Wednesday had traces of radiation and triggered fears of potential terrorist attacks using unmanned aerial devices , the prime ministers ' office has said . The infiltration at Japan ' s political headquarters has also raised questions over the level of security there . No one was injured and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was traveling at the time of the incident . Police said Yamamoto was arrested on suspicion of flying the drone and obstructing duties at the prime minister ' s office . He has not been indicted and faces further questioning . Public broadcaster NHK said police quoted the unemployed man as saying he did it to protest the government ' s nuclear energy policy . Fukui is home to about a quarter of Japan ' s 48 reactors , which are currently all offline following the 2011 tsunami - triggered Fukushima plant <tgr>disaster <tgr>. Abe ' s administration wants to restart as many of the idled plants as possible . The drone was carrying a small camera and a plastic bottle containing what police suspect was the source of radioactive cesium , levels of which were too low to affect humans or the environment . The suspect said he used the sand from an unspecified location in Fukushima , where radiation levels are still high due to fallouts from the Fukushima Dai - ichi meltdowns , NHK said . The government has set up a task force to work on regulations for the use of small drones while ensuring the security of key government facilities . Drones have become increasingly popular in Japan for industrial , service and entertainment use . At a meeting Friday , task force members cautioned against excessive restrictions on the emerging market for drones . It is not clear exactly when the drone landed because workers at the office in central Tokyo rarely go up to the roof . An official taking new employees on a building tour reportedly spotted the drone . \n\n{'Disease': 'BLANK', 'Victim': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

The Chelsea explosion occurred about 11 hours after a pipe bomb exploded in a Jersey Shore garbage can , shortly before a scheduled charity 5K race there benefiting Marines and Navy sailors . AD Authorities have said they have not yet found anything connecting the Chelsea and New Jersey incidents but are continuing to investigate . \n\n{'Dismantler': 'BLANK', 'Artifact': 'BLANK', 'Instrument': 'BLANK', 'Components': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

DJI Matrice 600 drones are a commercial model , normally used for industrial work — with a U . S . price tag of around $ 5 , 000 apiece , suggesting the attack could have cost little over $ 10k to carry out — with 1kg of plastic explosive available commercially ( for demolition purposes ) at a cost of around $ 30 . Bellingcat says its analysis supports the government ’ s claim that the drone model used was a DJI Matrice 600 , noting that the drones involved in the event each had six rotors . It also points to a photo of drone wreckage which appears to show the distinctive silver rotor tip of the model , although it also notes the drones appear to have had their legs removed . Venezuela ’ s interior minister , Nestor Reverol , also claimed the government thwarted the attack using \" special techniques and [ radio ] signal inhibitors \" , which \" disoriented \" the drone that detonated closest to the presidential stand — a capability Bellingcat notes the Venezuelan security services are reported to have . The second drone was said by Reverol to have \" lost control \" and <tgr>crashed <tgr>into a nearby building . Bellingcat says it is possible to geolocate the video of the falling drone to the same location as the fire in the apartment that firefighters had claimed was caused by a gas canister explosion . It adds that images taken of this location during the fire show a hole in the wall of the apartment in the vicinity of where the drone would have crashed . \" It is a very likely possibility that the downed drone subsequently detonated , creating the hole in the wall of this apartment , igniting a fire , and causing the sound of the second explosion which can be heard in Video 2 [ of the state TV broadcast of Maduro ’ s speech ] , \" it further suggests .

Public broadcaster NHK said police quoted the unemployed man as saying he did it to protest the government ' s nuclear energy policy . Fukui is home to about a quarter of Japan ' s 48 reactors , which are currently all offline following the 2011 tsunami - triggered Fukushima plant disaster . Abe ' s administration wants to restart as many of the idled plants as possible . The drone was carrying a small camera and a plastic bottle containing what police suspect was the source of radioactive cesium , levels of which were too low to affect humans or the environment . The suspect said he used the sand from an unspecified location in Fukushima , where radiation levels are still high due to fallouts from the Fukushima Dai - ichi meltdowns , NHK said . The government has set up a task force to work on regulations for the use of small drones while ensuring the security of key government facilities . Drones have become increasingly popular in Japan for industrial , service and entertainment use . At a meeting Friday , task force members cautioned against excessive restrictions on the emerging market for drones . It is not clear exactly when the drone landed because workers at the office in central Tokyo rarely go up to the roof . An official taking new employees on a building tour reportedly spotted the drone . A blog with an anti - nuclear theme managed under the name \" Kantei ( prime minister ' s office ) Santa \" contained photos of a drone that looked like the one found Wednesday . In one entry , the anonymous writer said he drove from his hometown in Obama city in Fukui to Tokyo and flew the drone in the early hours of April 9 , trying to have it land in the yard of the prime minister ' s office , but that he eventually lost track of the device . In the United States in January , a drone flown by an off - duty intelligence employee <tgr>crashed <tgr>on the White House grounds . \n\n{'DriverPassenger': 'BLANK', 'Vehicle': 'BLANK', 'CrashObject': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

    "144": "He spoke only once , when U . S . District Judge Richard Berman asked him to confirm that he intended to plead not guilty to an eight - count indictment filed on Wednesday . \" Yes , sir , \" Rahimi said . Prosecutors have accused the Afghan - born U . S . citizen of setting off an explosion in Manhattan ' s Chelsea neighborhood on Sept . 17 . It did not kill anyone but hurt 30 people . The attack came hours after authorities say another pipe bomb planted by Rahimi went off along the course of a charity road race in New Jersey , although that detonation did not injure anyone . Federal prosecutors also say Rahimi left another bomb in Chelsea that did not go off and several explosive devices in a bag at a train station in Elizabeth , New Jersey . In addition to the New York indictment , Rahimi faces charges from federal and state prosecutors in New Jersey . He was captured after a manhunt that ended when police officers discovered him sleeping in the doorway of a bar in Linden , New Jersey . The confrontation left him with several gunshot wounds , delaying the filing of federal charges and forcing him to make his first court appearance in New Jersey from a hospital bed . Assistant U . S . Attorney Nicholas Lewin told Berman that prosecutors had compiled video clips showing Rahimi ' s movements on the day of the bombings , including leaving his house carrying bags , walking on West 23rd Street where the device went off and planting the second bomb on West 27th Street . He also said the government has records showing Rahimi <tgr>purchased <tgr>bomb components online and DNA evidence tying him to the bombs . Lewin asked Berman to consider a trial date in the \" late winter \" or \" early spring , \" saying the amount of evidence in the case is relatively limited . Berman scheduled court dates for Dec . 19 and Jan . 31 but has not set a trial date . Rahimi ' s court - appointed defense lawyers declined to comment after the hearing . \n\n{'Giver': 'BLANK', 'Recipient': 'BLANK', 'AcquiredEntity': 'BLANK', 'PaymentBarter': 'BLANK', 'Beneficiary': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

The official said the assault began on Monday morning when the attackers rammed a car full explosives through a military checkpoint and detonated the vehicle inside the campus of the National Directorate of Security ( NDS ) forces training center in Maidan Shahr , the capital of Maidan Wardak province . Two gunmen entered the campus right after the explosion and shot at many Afghan soldiers before being gunned down during the clashes . Defense ministry officials said the Taliban had used U . S . - made armored Humvee vehicles captured from Afghan forces as a car bomb in order to breach the military fortifications . A second source residing in Maidan Wardak province said more than 100 members of National Directorate of Security ( NDS ) were killed in the complex attack . \" I have been in touch with the NDS official in the province and they told me that over 100 members of the NDS were killed in the big explosion , \" the former provincial official said .

Two senior officials in the interior ministry said the exact casualty figures were not being disclosed to prevent unrest within the armed forces . \" I have been told not to make the death toll figures public .

The small drone <tgr>found <tgr>Wednesday had traces of radiation and triggered fears of potential terrorist attacks using unmanned aerial devices , the prime ministers ' office has said . The infiltration at Japan ' s political headquarters has also raised questions over the level of security there . No one was injured and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was traveling at the time of the incident . Police said Yamamoto was arrested on suspicion of flying the drone and obstructing duties at the prime minister ' s office . He has not been indicted and faces further questioning .

The drone was carrying a small camera and a plastic bottle containing what police suspect was the source of radioactive cesium , levels of which were too low to affect humans or the environment . The suspect said he used the sand from an unspecified location in Fukushima , where radiation levels are still high due to fallouts from the Fukushima Dai - ichi meltdowns , NHK said . The government has set up a task force to work on regulations for the use of small drones while ensuring the security of key government facilities . Drones have become increasingly popular in Japan for industrial , service and entertainment use .

Colombia has asked Cuba to hand over the rebels affiliated with National Liberation Army ( ELN ) , who were in Havana for peace talks , after a deadly car bombing in Bogota was blamed on the group . Conservative President Ivan Duque urged Communist - ruled Cuba , a host and one of the guarantors of the peace process , to send home the ELN rebels in Havana . Cuba ’ s foreign minister said in a tweet late on Friday that the country would respect the protocols of the negotiations it had been hosting and was consulting with both parties and the guarantors of the talks . On Friday , Colombia blamed the leftist ELN for the bombing of a police academy in Bogota that killed 20 people as well as the attacker , dealing a big blow to the peace process . 190102132047518 Duque then announced that he was reinstating arrest warrants for 10 ELN members , who are part of the group ’ s delegation to the Cuba talks . The talks were aimed at ending more than five decades of fighting by the Marxist - inspired group . Duque said that Cuba must not protect the rebels . The police academy car bombing “ was a crime that violated human rights and no such act deserves [ Cuba acting ] to avoid justice being done ” , Duque said while giving a speech in Tolima . Colombians , including Duque , planned to join in a march on Sunday to protest against the car bombing , the worst such attack in the country in 16 years . Last rebel group In November , Colombia asked Cuba to capture ELN rebel commander Nicolas Rodriguez and provide information about the presence of other commanders in the Cuban territory . The government in Bogota also asked Havana to act on an Interpol Red Notice against Rodriguez . The Cuban government did not respond publicly to that request or made a statement about the issue . Colombia has experienced several years of relative calm since the 2016 peace accord signed by then - President Juan Manuel Santos and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) fighters . 190118182118648 \n\n{'Impeder': 'BLANK', 'ImpededEvent': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

    "152": "The Venezuelan government claimed three days ago that an attempt had been made to assassinate President Nicolás Maduro using two drones loaded with explosives . The president had been giving a speech which was being broadcast live on television when the incident occurred . Initial video from a state - owned television network showed the reaction of Maduro , those around him and a parade of soldiers at the event to what appeared to be two blasts somewhere off camera . But the footage did not include shots of any drones or explosions . AP also reported that firefighters at scene had shed doubt on the drone attack claim — suggesting there had instead been a gas explosion in a nearby flat . Since then more footage has emerged , including videos purporting to show a drone exploding and a drone tumbling alongside a building . Bellingcat has carried out an <tgr>analysis <tgr>of publicly available information related to the attack , including syncing timings of the state broadcast of Maduro ’ s speech , and using frame - by - frame analysis combined with photos and satellite imagery of Caracas to try to pinpoint locations of additional footage that has emerged to determine whether the drone attack claim stands up . The Venezuelan government has claimed the drones used were DJI Matrice 600s , each carrying approximately 1kg of C4 plastic explosive and , when detonated , capable of causing damage at a radius of around 50 meters . DJI Matrice 600 drones are a commercial model , normally used for industrial work — with a U . S . price tag of around $ 5 , 000 apiece , suggesting the attack could have cost little over $ 10k to carry out — with 1kg of plastic explosive available commercially ( for demolition purposes ) at a cost of around $ 30 . Bellingcat says its analysis supports the government ’ s claim that the drone model used was a DJI Matrice 600 , noting that the drones involved in the event each had six rotors . It also points to a photo of drone wreckage which appears to show the distinctive silver rotor tip of the model , although it also notes the drones appear to have had their legs removed . \n\n{'Investigator': 'BLANK', 'Defendant': 'BLANK', 'Crime': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

    "154": "Bombing Suspects ' Parents Questioned in Dagestan U . S . investigators have questioned the parents of the two Boston Marathon bombing suspects in the Russian republic of Dagestan , as they try to determine what might have influenced their sons in the months before the April 15 attack . The American authorities , working with Russian security forces , interviewed both parents Tuesday night and called back the suspects ' mother , Zubeidat Tsarnaev , for more questioning on Wednesday . The investigators are particularly interested in any contacts the elder brother , Tamerlan Tsarnaev , might have had with Islamic extremists during a six - month visit to Dagestan and Chechnya last year . U . S . lawmakers discussed the same trip Tuesday as they raised concerns about the sharing of intelligence among federal law enforcement agencies . Senator Lindsey Graham said the FBI told him it was not aware at the time of Tamerlan Tsarnaev ' s trip to Russia . Tamerlan Tsarnaev died after a shootout with police last Thursday , while his younger brother Dzhokhar was <tgr>captured <tgr>a day later . Meanwhile , in Boston , authorities on Wednesday reopened Boylston Street , the city thoroughfare where the explosions occurred near the finish line of the race . Later , several thousand people gathered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for a memorial service for campus policeman Sean Collier , who authorities say the Tsarnaev brothers shot to death three days after the bombings .

    "156": "He spoke only once , when U . S . District Judge Richard Berman asked him to confirm that he intended to plead not guilty to an eight - count indictment filed on Wednesday . \" Yes , sir , \" Rahimi said . Prosecutors have accused the Afghan - born U . S . citizen of setting off an explosion in Manhattan ' s Chelsea neighborhood on Sept . 17 . It did not kill anyone but hurt 30 people . The attack came hours after authorities say another pipe bomb planted by Rahimi went off along the course of a charity road race in New Jersey , although that detonation did not injure anyone . Federal prosecutors also say Rahimi left another bomb in Chelsea that did not go off and several explosive devices in a bag at a train station in Elizabeth , New Jersey . In addition to the New York indictment , Rahimi faces charges from federal and state prosecutors in New Jersey . He was <tgr>captured <tgr>after a manhunt that ended when police officers discovered him sleeping in the doorway of a bar in Linden , New Jersey . The confrontation left him with several gunshot wounds , delaying the filing of federal charges and forcing him to make his first court appearance in New Jersey from a hospital bed . Assistant U . S . Attorney Nicholas Lewin told Berman that prosecutors had compiled video clips showing Rahimi ' s movements on the day of the bombings , including leaving his house carrying bags , walking on West 23rd Street where the device went off and planting the second bomb on West 27th Street . He also said the government has records showing Rahimi purchased bomb components online and DNA evidence tying him to the bombs . Lewin asked Berman to consider a trial date in the \" late winter \" or \" early spring , \" saying the amount of evidence in the case is relatively limited . Berman scheduled court dates for Dec . 19 and Jan . 31 but has not set a trial date . Rahimi ' s court - appointed defense lawyers declined to comment after the hearing . \n\n{'Jailer': 'BLANK', 'Detainee': 'BLANK', 'Crime': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

Tokyo metropolitan police said Yasuo Yamamoto , 40 , turned himself in to authorities late Friday in Fukui in western Japan . The small drone found Wednesday had traces of radiation and triggered fears of potential terrorist attacks using unmanned aerial devices , the prime ministers ' office has said . The infiltration at Japan ' s political headquarters has also raised questions over the level of security there . No one was injured and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was traveling at the time of the incident . Police said Yamamoto was arrested on suspicion of flying the drone and obstructing duties at the prime minister ' s office . He has not been indicted and faces further questioning . Public broadcaster NHK said police quoted the unemployed man as saying he did it to protest the government ' s nuclear energy policy . Fukui is home to about a quarter of Japan ' s 48 reactors , which are currently all offline following the 2011 tsunami - triggered Fukushima plant disaster . Abe ' s administration wants to restart as many of the idled plants as possible . The drone was carrying a small camera and a plastic bottle containing what police suspect was the source of radioactive cesium , levels of which were too low to affect humans or the environment . The suspect said he used the sand from an unspecified location in Fukushima , where radiation levels are still high due to fallouts from the Fukushima Dai - ichi meltdowns , NHK said . The government has set up a task force to work on regulations for the use of small drones while ensuring the security of key government facilities . Drones have become increasingly popular in Japan for industrial , service and entertainment use . At a meeting Friday , task force members cautioned against excessive restrictions on the emerging market for drones . \n\n{'Jailer': 'BLANK', 'Detainee': 'BLANK', 'Crime': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

Last rebel group In November , Colombia asked Cuba to <tgr>capture <tgr>ELN rebel commander Nicolas Rodriguez and provide information about the presence of other commanders in the Cuban territory .

Peace talks with the ELN began in February 2017 under Santos , but Duque has put them on hold until the rebels free all their hostages and stop attacks on military and civilian targets . The group is believed to be currently holding 17 hostages , some of them for several years . \n\n{'Jailer': 'BLANK', 'Detainee': 'BLANK', 'Crime': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

They lashed out at him for his “ cowardly ” and “ disgusting ” acts , and several called upon him to apologize , trying to convince him that this would be his last chance to ask for forgiveness . Tsarnaev , his chair turned toward the lectern from which the victims spoke , picked at his beard and gazed downward most of the time , only occasionally looking at the speakers . \n\n{'JudgeCourt': 'BLANK', 'Defendant': 'BLANK', 'Crime': 'BLANK', 'Sentence': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

    "189": "By MARI YAMAGUCHI , Associated Press TOKYO ( AP ) — Japanese police have arrested a man who admitted to landing a drone with low - level radioactive sand on the roof of the prime minister ' s office to protest the government ' s nuclear energy policy , officials said Saturday . Tokyo metropolitan police said Yasuo Yamamoto , 40 , turned himself in to authorities late Friday in Fukui in western Japan . The small drone found Wednesday had traces of radiation and triggered fears of potential terrorist attacks using unmanned aerial devices , the prime ministers ' office has said . The infiltration at Japan ' s political headquarters has also raised questions over the level of security there . No one was injured and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was traveling at the time of the incident . Police said Yamamoto was arrested on suspicion of flying the drone and <tgr>obstructing duties <tgr>at the prime minister ' s office . He has not been indicted and faces further questioning . Public broadcaster NHK said police quoted the unemployed man as saying he did it to protest the government ' s nuclear energy policy . Fukui is home to about a quarter of Japan ' s 48 reactors , which are currently all offline following the 2011 tsunami - triggered Fukushima plant disaster . Abe ' s administration wants to restart as many of the idled plants as possible . The drone was carrying a small camera and a plastic bottle containing what police suspect was the source of radioactive cesium , levels of which were too low to affect humans or the environment . The suspect said he used the sand from an unspecified location in Fukushima , where radiation levels are still high due to fallouts from the Fukushima Dai - ichi meltdowns , NHK said . The government has set up a task force to work on regulations for the use of small drones while ensuring the security of key government facilities . Drones have become increasingly popular in Japan for industrial , service and entertainment use . At a meeting Friday , task force members cautioned against excessive restrictions on the emerging market for drones . \n\n{'Perpetrator': 'BLANK', 'Victim': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

    "194": "The American authorities , working with Russian security forces , interviewed both parents Tuesday night and called back the suspects ' mother , Zubeidat Tsarnaev , for more questioning on Wednesday . The investigators are particularly interested in any contacts the elder brother , Tamerlan Tsarnaev , might have had with Islamic extremists during a six - month visit to Dagestan and Chechnya last year . U . S . lawmakers discussed the same trip Tuesday as they raised concerns about the sharing of intelligence among federal law enforcement agencies . Senator Lindsey Graham said the FBI told him it was not aware at the time of Tamerlan Tsarnaev ' s trip to Russia . Tamerlan Tsarnaev died after a shootout with police last Thursday , while his younger brother Dzhokhar was captured a day later . Meanwhile , in Boston , authorities on Wednesday reopened Boylston Street , the city thoroughfare where the explosions occurred near the finish line of the race . Later , several thousand people gathered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for a memorial service for campus policeman Sean Collier , who authorities say the Tsarnaev brothers shot to death three days after the bombings . Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano told the Senate Intelligence Committee that her agency did know about Tamerlan ' s trip , but that an FBI alert on him had expired by the time he returned . The FBI had interviewed Tsarnaev in 2011 at Russia ' s request , but found nothing to connect him to terrorism at that time . The 19 - year - old Dzhokhar has been <tgr>charged <tgr>with using a weapon of mass destruction . He is in federal custody in a Boston hospital . U . S . officials say Dzhokhar told them in preliminary interviews that he and his brother were partly motivated by the U . S . wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , but that they were self - radicalized and not connected to any terrorist network . The two suspects are Chechens who came to the United States as boys . The brothers allegedly set off two bombs alongside the Boston Marathon course , killing three people and injuring 264 . At least 14 of the wounded lost legs in the blasts . \n\n{'Prosecutor': 'BLANK', 'Defendant': 'BLANK', 'JudgeCourt': 'BLANK', 'Crime': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

District Judge George O ' Toole Jr . began to speak , with his voice breaking several times . He officially imposed the death sentence on Tsarnaev that jurors had recommended unanimously . In May , after a 12 - week trial , Tsarnaev was found guilty of killing three people and injuring 264 in the April 15 , 2013 , bombing at the world - renowned race , where he and his brother , Tamerlan , 26 , set off two pressure - cooker bombs near the finish line .

Tsarnaev was found guilty of all 30 terrorism and other <tgr>charges <tgr>against him . Of those , 17 carried the possibility of a death sentence . During the penalty phase of the judicial proceedings , prosecutors brushed off defense arguments that Tsarnaev was under the strong influence of his older , radicalized brother .

They lashed out at him for his “ cowardly ” and “ disgusting ” acts , and several called upon him to apologize , trying to convince him that this would be his last chance to ask for forgiveness . Tsarnaev , his chair turned toward the lectern from which the victims spoke , picked at his beard and gazed downward most of the time , only occasionally looking at the speakers . \n\n{'Prosecutor': 'BLANK', 'Defendant': 'BLANK', 'JudgeCourt': 'BLANK', 'Crime': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

    "220": "Moments before a federal judge sentenced him to death , Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev rose to his feet Wednesday and apologized to the victims and their loved ones for the first time . \" I pray for your relief , for your healing , ' ' he said . Amid deep silence in the courtroom , the 21 - year - old ethnic Chechen said , \" I am sorry for the lives that I ' ve taken , for the suffering that I ' ve caused you , for the damage that I ' ve done — irreparable damage . ' ' It was the first time Tsarnaev , who did not speak in his own defense at trial , had addressed the court . After Tsarnaev finished , U . S . District Judge George O ' Toole Jr . began to speak , with his voice breaking several times . He officially imposed the death sentence on Tsarnaev that jurors had recommended unanimously . In May , after a 12 - week trial , Tsarnaev was found guilty of killing three people and <tgr>injuring <tgr>264 in the April 15 , 2013 , bombing at the world - renowned race , where he and his brother , Tamerlan , 26 , set off two pressure - cooker bombs near the finish line . Tsarnaev was also found guilty in the fatal shooting of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer three days later as he and his brother fled . Tamerlan was killed during the getaway . Tsarnaev was found guilty of all 30 terrorism and other charges against him . Of those , 17 carried the possibility of a death sentence . During the penalty phase of the judicial proceedings , prosecutors brushed off defense arguments that Tsarnaev was under the strong influence of his older , radicalized brother . Victims speak out Before the sentencing , a somber - looking Tsarnaev , wearing a dark sport jacket with a collared shirt and no tie , sat between his lawyers and listened as 24 people — some victims , some survivors — gave impact statements . They lashed out at him for his “ cowardly ” and “ disgusting ” acts , and several called upon him to apologize , trying to convince him that this would be his last chance to ask for forgiveness . \n\n{'Victim': 'BLANK', 'Injurer': 'BLANK', 'Instrument': 'BLANK', 'BodyPart': 'BLANK', 'MedicalCondition': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

    "225": "The use of drones aligned with Obama ’ s ambition to keep up the war against al Qaeda while extricating the US military from intractable , costly ground wars in the Middle East and Asia . But the targeted killing programme has drawn much criticism . The Obama administration has insisted that drone strikes are so “ exceptionally surgical and precise ” that they pluck off terror suspects while not putting “ innocent men , women and children in danger ” . This claim has been contested by numerous human rights groups , however , and the Bureau ’ s figures on civilian casualties also demonstrate that this is often not the case . The White House released long - awaited figures last July on the number of people killed in drone strikes between January 2009 and the end of 2015 , an announcement which insiders said was a direct response to pressure from the Bureau and other organisations that collect data . However the US ’ s estimate of the number of civilians killed – between 64 and 116 – contrasted strongly with the number recorded by the Bureau , which at 380 to 801 was six times higher . That figure does not include deaths in active battlefields including Afghanistan – where US air attacks have shot up since Obama withdrew the majority of his troops at the end of 2014 . The country has since come under frequent US bombardment , in an unreported war that saw 1 , 337 weapons dropped last year alone – a 40 % rise on 2015 . Afghan civilian casualties have been high , with the United Nations ( UN ) reporting at least 85 <tgr>deaths <tgr>in 2016 . The Bureau recorded 65 to 105 civilian deaths during this period . We did not start collecting data on Afghanistan until 2015 . Pakistan was the hub of drone operations during Obama ’ s first term . The pace of attacks had accelerated in the second half of 2008 at the end of Bush ’ s term , after four years pocked by occasional strikes . However in the year after taking office , Obama ordered more drone strikes than Bush did during his entire presidency . The 54 strikes in 2009 all took place in Pakistan . \n\n{'Victim': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK', 'Killer': 'BLANK', 'MedicalIssue': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

Kieran Conway , who was head of the IRA ’ s intelligence - gathering department in the 1970s , broke a 40 - year silence by the organisation to make the admission . He admitted he was “ appalled and ashamed ” because he claimed the bombing of civilians went against everything it stood for . He said the attacks on The Mulberry Bush and The Tavern in The Town had been in revenge for the <tgr>death <tgr>of IRA bomber James McDade . At first he feared that the timing of the attacks - with very little warning - had been deliberate because “ tempers were high ” .

Seven \" incident centres \" were established in Irish nationalist areas in Northern Ireland to monitor the ceasefire and the activity of the security forces . Before the truce , the IRA active service unit ( ASU ) later dubbed the Balcombe Street Gang ( due to the December 1975 Balcombe Street siege ) had been carrying out bomb and gun attacks in Southern England since autumn 1974 , mostly in and around London . Their last previous attack was an assassination attempt on former Prime Minister Edward Heath but he was not home when the attackers threw a bomb into his bedroom window on 22 December 1974 . == The bombing == The Balcombe Street Gang planted a time bomb in the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham , Surrey . The IRA unit placed the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat . There was no warning and the bomb exploded at 9 : 20 , injuring 23 civilians and 10 off - duty soldiers . The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby . Some of the <tgr>injuries <tgr>were very serious , with at least three soldiers losing limbs . The blast blew the roof off the pub in the process . This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign ( Phase Two ) in England and the end of the truce with the British Government . The next day , the same IRA unit exploded a bomb in Oxford Street , injuring several people . == Aftermath == One of the police officers in charge of the investigation into the bombing described it as a \" carbon copy \" of the Guildford pub bombings in October 1974 for which four people were already serving their sentences . The cell ' s campaign would continue until December 1975 when they were caught at the siege of Balcombe Street . The unit would eventually end up planting close to 50 bombs in London and elsewhere in southern England and carrying out several shootings which , along with the bombings , caused the deaths of nearly 20 people , injured hundreds and caused millions of pounds worth of damage to property . \n\n{'Victim': 'BLANK', 'Injurer': 'BLANK', 'Instrument': 'BLANK', 'BodyPart': 'BLANK', 'MedicalCondition': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

In May , after a 12 - week trial , Tsarnaev was found guilty of killing three people and injuring 264 in the April 15 , 2013 , bombing at the world - renowned race , where he and his brother , Tamerlan , 26 , set off two pressure - cooker bombs near the finish line . Tsarnaev was also found guilty in the fatal shooting of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer three days later as he and his brother fled . Tamerlan was <tgr>killed <tgr>during the getaway . Tsarnaev was found guilty of all 30 terrorism and other charges against him . Of those , 17 carried the possibility of a death sentence . During the penalty phase of the judicial proceedings , prosecutors brushed off defense arguments that Tsarnaev was under the strong influence of his older , radicalized brother . Victims speak out Before the sentencing , a somber - looking Tsarnaev , wearing a dark sport jacket with a collared shirt and no tie , sat between his lawyers and listened as 24 people — some victims , some survivors — gave impact statements . They lashed out at him for his “ cowardly ” and “ disgusting ” acts , and several called upon him to apologize , trying to convince him that this would be his last chance to ask for forgiveness . Tsarnaev , his chair turned toward the lectern from which the victims spoke , picked at his beard and gazed downward most of the time , only occasionally looking at the speakers . \n\n{'Victim': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK', 'Killer': 'BLANK', 'MedicalIssue': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

Colombia has asked Cuba to hand over the rebels affiliated with National Liberation Army ( ELN ) , who were in Havana for peace talks , after a deadly car bombing in Bogota was blamed on the group . Conservative President Ivan Duque urged Communist - ruled Cuba , a host and one of the guarantors of the peace process , to send home the ELN rebels in Havana .

The talks were aimed at ending more than five decades of fighting by the Marxist - inspired group . Duque said that Cuba must not protect the rebels . The police academy car bombing “ was a crime that violated human rights and no such act deserves [ Cuba acting ] to avoid justice being done ” , Duque said while giving a speech in Tolima . Colombians , including Duque , planned to join in a march on Sunday to protest against the car bombing , the worst such attack in the country in 16 years .

The government in Bogota also asked Havana to act on an Interpol Red Notice against Rodriguez . The Cuban government did not respond publicly to that request or made a statement about the issue . Colombia has experienced several years of relative calm since the 2016 peace accord signed by then - President Juan Manuel Santos and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) fighters . 190118182118648 \n\n{'Victim': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK', 'Killer': 'BLANK', 'MedicalIssue': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

Wearing a dark blue jump suit , Rahimi , 28 , shuffled slowly into federal court in Manhattan and had several coughing fits during the brief hearing . He suffered serious injuries in a shootout with police two days after the bombing . He spoke only once , when U . S . District Judge Richard Berman asked him to confirm that he intended to plead not guilty to an eight - count indictment filed on Wednesday . \" Yes , sir , \" Rahimi said . Prosecutors have accused the Afghan - born U . S . citizen of setting off an explosion in Manhattan ' s Chelsea neighborhood on Sept . 17 . It did not kill anyone but hurt 30 people . The attack came hours after authorities say another pipe bomb planted by Rahimi went off along the course of a charity road race in New Jersey , although that detonation did not injure anyone . Federal prosecutors also say Rahimi left another bomb in Chelsea that did not go off and several explosive devices in a bag at a train station in Elizabeth , New Jersey . In addition to the New York indictment , Rahimi faces charges from federal and state prosecutors in New Jersey . He was captured after a manhunt that ended when police officers discovered him sleeping in the doorway of a bar in Linden , New Jersey . The confrontation left him with several gunshot wounds , delaying the filing of federal charges and forcing him to make his first court appearance in New Jersey from a hospital bed . Assistant U . S . Attorney Nicholas Lewin told Berman that prosecutors had compiled video clips showing Rahimi ' s movements on the day of the bombings , including leaving his house carrying bags , walking on West 23rd Street where the device went off and planting the second bomb on West 27th Street . He also said the government has records showing Rahimi purchased bomb components online and DNA evidence tying him to the bombs . \n\n{'Victim': 'BLANK', 'Injurer': 'BLANK', 'Instrument': 'BLANK', 'BodyPart': 'BLANK', 'MedicalCondition': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

Two off - duty soldiers lost their legs as a result of the bombing . == Background == In February 1975 the Provisional Irish Republican Army agreed to a truce and ceasefire with the British government and the Northern Ireland Office . Seven \" incident centres \" were established in Irish nationalist areas in Northern Ireland to monitor the ceasefire and the activity of the security forces . Before the truce , the IRA active service unit ( ASU ) later dubbed the Balcombe Street Gang ( due to the December 1975 Balcombe Street siege ) had been carrying out bomb and gun attacks in Southern England since autumn 1974 , mostly in and around London . Their last previous attack was an assassination attempt on former Prime Minister Edward Heath but he was not home when the attackers threw a bomb into his bedroom window on 22 December 1974 . == The bombing == The Balcombe Street Gang planted a time bomb in the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham , Surrey . The IRA unit placed the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat . There was no warning and the bomb exploded at 9 : 20 , injuring 23 civilians and 10 off - duty soldiers . The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby . Some of the injuries were very serious , with at least three soldiers losing limbs . The blast blew the roof off the pub in the process . This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign ( Phase Two ) in England and the end of the truce with the British Government .

But officials in Washington have been warning about the possibility of so - called improvised explosive devises in recent weeks .

The investigators are particularly interested in any contacts the elder brother , Tamerlan Tsarnaev , might have had with Islamic extremists during a six - month visit to Dagestan and Chechnya last year . U . S . lawmakers discussed the same trip Tuesday as they raised concerns about the sharing of intelligence among federal law enforcement agencies . Senator Lindsey Graham said the FBI told him it was not aware at the time of Tamerlan Tsarnaev ' s trip to Russia . Tamerlan Tsarnaev died after a shootout with police last Thursday , while his younger brother Dzhokhar was captured a day later .

Later , several thousand people gathered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for a memorial service for campus policeman Sean Collier , who authorities say the Tsarnaev brothers shot to death three days after the bombings . Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano told the Senate Intelligence Committee that her agency did know about Tamerlan ' s trip , but that an FBI alert on him had expired by the time he returned . The FBI had interviewed Tsarnaev in 2011 at Russia ' s request , but found nothing to connect him to terrorism at that time . The 19 - year - old Dzhokhar has been charged with using a weapon of mass destruction . He is in federal custody in a Boston hospital . U . S . officials say Dzhokhar told them in preliminary interviews that he and his brother were partly motivated by the U . S . wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , but that they were self - radicalized and not connected to any terrorist network . The two suspects are Chechens who came to the United States as boys . The brothers allegedly set off two bombs alongside the Boston Marathon course , <tgr>killing <tgr>three people and injuring 264 .

The court on Tuesday indicted Bilal Mohammed and Mieraili Yusufu on 10 counts connected to the blast , including conspiracy to explode bombs and commit premeditated murder . Thailand authorities have not officially named the bombing of Erawan Shrine an act of terror , and accordingly neither suspect was charged specifically with terrorism . Police issued 17 arrest warrants following the bombing but only Bilal and Mieraili have been detained . They are described as ethnic Uighurs , a minority group based in China ' s Xinjiang region . They have been held in custody since their arrests in late August and early September . Thai officials have said the blast was carried out by a people - smuggling gang seeking revenge on Thai authorities for cracking down on their operation . The August 17 blast at the Erawan Shrine - a popular tourist destination - was one of the most deadly acts of violence in Bangkok in decades , and left 20 people <tgr>dead <tgr>and more than 120 injured . Of the dead , 14 were tourists . The attack shocked the residents of the capital because of the apparent randomness , which drove home the point that no place is immune to acts of terror . Authorities , however , have declined to call it an act of terrorism out of apparent fear that it would hurt the country ' s huge tourism industry . Police initially appeared at first to be at a loss , but soon claimed success with a series of raids and two arrests . Arrest warrants have been issued for 15 others . The two suspects were brought to the court in handcuffs wearing brown prison garb . Members of the media were not allowed to enter the court and the indictments took place before the two suspects arrived , said defense lawyer Chuchart Kanpai .

In recent years the Afghan government has stopped releasing detailed casualty figures .

Wearing a dark blue jump suit , Rahimi , 28 , shuffled slowly into federal court in Manhattan and had several coughing fits during the brief hearing . He suffered serious <tgr>injuries <tgr>in a shootout with police two days after the bombing . He spoke only once , when U . S . District Judge Richard Berman asked him to confirm that he intended to plead not guilty to an eight - count indictment filed on Wednesday . \" Yes , sir , \" Rahimi said . Prosecutors have accused the Afghan - born U . S . citizen of setting off an explosion in Manhattan ' s Chelsea neighborhood on Sept . 17 . It did not kill anyone but hurt 30 people . The attack came hours after authorities say another pipe bomb planted by Rahimi went off along the course of a charity road race in New Jersey , although that detonation did not injure anyone . Federal prosecutors also say Rahimi left another bomb in Chelsea that did not go off and several explosive devices in a bag at a train station in Elizabeth , New Jersey . In addition to the New York indictment , Rahimi faces charges from federal and state prosecutors in New Jersey . He was captured after a manhunt that ended when police officers discovered him sleeping in the doorway of a bar in Linden , New Jersey . The confrontation left him with several gunshot wounds , delaying the filing of federal charges and forcing him to make his first court appearance in New Jersey from a hospital bed . Assistant U . S . Attorney Nicholas Lewin told Berman that prosecutors had compiled video clips showing Rahimi ' s movements on the day of the bombings , including leaving his house carrying bags , walking on West 23rd Street where the device went off and planting the second bomb on West 27th Street . He also said the government has records showing Rahimi purchased bomb components online and DNA evidence tying him to the bombs . \n\n{'Victim': 'BLANK', 'Injurer': 'BLANK', 'Instrument': 'BLANK', 'BodyPart': 'BLANK', 'MedicalCondition': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

    "277": "The use of drones aligned with Obama ’ s ambition to keep up the war against al Qaeda while extricating the US military from intractable , costly ground wars in the Middle East and Asia . But the targeted killing programme has drawn much criticism . The Obama administration has insisted that drone strikes are so “ exceptionally surgical and precise ” that they pluck off terror suspects while not putting “ innocent men , women and children in danger ” . This claim has been contested by numerous human rights groups , however , and the Bureau ’ s figures on civilian casualties also demonstrate that this is often not the case . The White House released long - awaited figures last July on the number of people killed in drone strikes between January 2009 and the end of 2015 , an announcement which insiders said was a direct response to pressure from the Bureau and other organisations that collect data . However the US ’ s estimate of the number of civilians killed – between 64 and 116 – contrasted strongly with the number recorded by the Bureau , which at 380 to 801 was six times higher . That figure does not include <tgr>deaths <tgr>in active battlefields including Afghanistan – where US air attacks have shot up since Obama withdrew the majority of his troops at the end of 2014 . The country has since come under frequent US bombardment , in an unreported war that saw 1 , 337 weapons dropped last year alone – a 40 % rise on 2015 . Afghan civilian casualties have been high , with the United Nations ( UN ) reporting at least 85 deaths in 2016 . The Bureau recorded 65 to 105 civilian deaths during this period . We did not start collecting data on Afghanistan until 2015 . Pakistan was the hub of drone operations during Obama ’ s first term . The pace of attacks had accelerated in the second half of 2008 at the end of Bush ’ s term , after four years pocked by occasional strikes . However in the year after taking office , Obama ordered more drone strikes than Bush did during his entire presidency . The 54 strikes in 2009 all took place in Pakistan . \n\n{'Victim': 'BLANK', 'Place': 'BLANK', 'Killer': 'BLANK', 'MedicalIssue': 'BLANK'}\n\nReplace the BLANKs with the extracted information about the event in <tgr> .

They lashed out at him for his “ cowardly ” and “ disgusting ” acts , and several called upon him to apologize , trying to convince him that this would be his last chance to ask for forgiveness .
