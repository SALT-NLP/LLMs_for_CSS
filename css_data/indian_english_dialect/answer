222	Prepositional Phrase Fronting With Reduction	M: Left Dislocation (e.g., 'My parents, they really enjoy playing board games.') is the most accurate option as the sentence contains an abrupt shift in focus, which is a characteristic feature of left dislocation.

The use of "but" also sets up a contrast between the unrestricted ability to say anything and the restricted timeline of the speaker's departure.

254	Preposition Omission	M: Left Dislocation (e.g., 'My parents, they really enjoy playing board games.')

This construction is often used to bring attention to the displaced constituent, and is common in spoken discourse.
