Same applies to several other article, and it would have been helpful if you left a note in the discussion to help remind us which and what sections. \nArcadian: Please review [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (medicine-related articles)]]. Before I made [http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/w\\/index.php?title=Borna_disease&diff=265389092&oldid=265356724 my edits], the article (which was created on 20 April 2004) had exactly one in-line reference, and that was to a dead link. The current version of [[Borna disease]] isn't perfect, but it is much closer to MEDMOS compliance. There is a general consensus that tiny articles without references should usually have the virus and the condition on the same page, and that larger articles with many references should usually have them split. Unfocused articles improve much more slowly than focused ones. But there isn't a consensus as to the exact dividing line. I wish there was an active and centralized microbiology community on Wikipedia with clear standards and a defined style guide, but there isn't one yet. But if you'd be interested in building one together, I'd be happy to collaborate with you. --\nChyranandChloe: This is what I got. Point 2.1 seems a bit weak since we could also argue that \\\"Borna disease\\\" is the more natural name even though it seems unlikely that a reader would type all that into the search box (they'd more likely go through the infobox); so we could drop that one and give a \\\"For the disease...\\\". \nArcadian: I think we're largely in agreement. Should we drill down to the genus, or the species? When I'm trying to figure out appropriate terminology, I often consult [[MeSH]]. Per {{MeshName|Borna+disease+virus}}, \\\"Borna disease virus\\\" is the [[species]], and \\\"Bornavirus\\\" is the [[genus]]. In my opinion, either could work as the title for a dedicated article about the virus, but I'd be happy to defer to you or others as to which would be more appropriate. (Certainly, [[virus classification]] is less mature than that of other pathogens.) Also, when you say \\\"bring it to the community\\\", which community do you recommend? I'm thinking we should work to try to merge [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Viruses]] and [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Prokaryotes and protists]] into [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Microbiology]], and then bring our thoughts to WikiProject Microbiology. (Although that project is inactive, I think it could become more active with a little creative nudging.) But I'm open to other approaches. --\nChyranandChloe: I think we need more than just inactivity for a wikiproject merge; the other approach would simply to let it be, and most people who are interested in the community can enroll in WP:MICRO just as easily as WP:VIRUS. I would bring it to WP:VIRUS first (also because I've been a part of it long enough to know some of the people), and then to WP:MICRO if we can get a consensus in WP:VIRUS; another reason to bring it to WP:VIRUS is that the issue have been essentially about virology and spinning off the virology section. I other news, I've redrafted point 2.1, now that our former example is no longer valid. If we have a go on points 1, 2.1, and 2.2 \\u2014 then we can begin drafting the full proposal and rationale; and we can send a joint proposal to WP:VIRUS.<p>Ok, thanks for clarifying [[Borna disease virus]], I'm actually quite a bit surprised that I didn't catch that, BVD is the species and Bornavirus is the genus; it's even listed in the infobox. Nevertheless, that redraws how we're dividing it, [[Bornavirus]] stays as it is; so the only issue left is to CSD move [[Borna disease]] to [[Borna disease virus]] (BVD is the most likely search term), and then writing a short virology section there. \nArcadian: If we're going to use WP:VIRUS, then I'm not confident that we can get enough eyeballs, but if you want to bring it there, let me know, and I will be happy to offer my support in that forum. --\nChyranandChloe: (outdent) [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Viruses#Virus spinoff guideline or recommendation]].

If our goal is to have a balanced article, from what I see we seem to be on the right direction, although I still think the article focuses much more on the, so called, ''negative'' aspects of his life, while the, so called, ''positive'' ones are much resumed, so I think you don\\xb4t have much reasons to feel unhappy.

I wouldn't use edit summaries like [http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/w\\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship\\/NHRHS2010_2&curid=12996997&diff=154352443&oldid=154347431 this] as it won't help your cause. I know how horrible RFA is, particularly when the opposes come in. It's frustrating because '''you''' know you won't do anything silly with the tools, it's just convincing '''everyone else'''. I orginally opposed but re-read my comments and moved to Neutral. Please remember that 99% of people at RFA are honestly assesing how they feel about a candidate, and aren't opposing for reasons of malice or anything. Keep you chin up! Very Best Wishes. <small><span style=\\\"border:1px solid #0000ff;padding:1px;\\\">\nPedro: Hiya. If it fails you can re-apply whenever you feel ready. There is no specific timescale, but in my experience it is best to leave a minimum of two months between RFA's and ideally probably three. I have seen many RFA's fail simply because a user has reapplied quickly, making them seem \\\"over eager\\\" for the tools. A few words of unasked for advice. [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship\\/Pedro|My RFA]] failed (well, I pulled it as a major area of procedure was highlighted to me that I wasn't following) and a lot of the issues behind the opposers was a lack of article building. Now at the time my main interest was vandal fighting, and I really thought article building was not for me. But then I thought - well, let's give it a go - not for reasons of getting the admin buttons, just to try it. And guess what - I now have two DYK articles that were featured on the main page! It's nothing compared to a lot of other article writers (it's pretty insignificant in the scheme of things) but it certainly did help me understand better the \\\"big picture\\\". You do need a small amount of experience in actual writing to understand fully things like CSD and XFD. My suggestion - pick a topic you really find interesting and see what you can do to either create an article or expand one. It will no doubt help you achieve the aim of getting the admin buttons, but more importantly is fun and helps one understand the project more fully (well it did for me!) I hope that helps. <small><span style=\\\"border:1px solid #0000ff;padding:1px;\\\">\nNHRHS2010: I got your message.

This is .en wikipedia so the ability (particularly for an admin) to communicate clearly in English is important, but it is not the only factor by a long way. By the way - I have interacted with Lucid regularly and I have to be honest - he is a great wikipedian and would never oppose from malice or because he \\\"doesn't want someone\\\" to be an admin.

You should still keep up the good work you have done and hopefully you'll do better next time. Good luck, --\nLucid: Thank you Pedro. I don't find having perfect English is terribly important, my English isn't the greatest itself, but combined with other things it gave me concerns about your abilities to communicate with other editors. I have nothing against you on a personal note, and I certainly don't hate you, I just don't feel comfortable with you being an admin right now, you have a lot of things to work on. A bit of advice though, you're taking this way too personally and making too big a deal out of it. People don't want to see that in a candidate, it makes them think that they might be a bit too immature for the mop, and they think it has something special for them. --<span style=\\\"font-variant:small-caps\\\">'''\nLucid: I don't know why, but I found this very funny. Probably because I've only actually given an opinion on like two *fDs since the change, or maybe because I've heard from a lot of people that the RFAs we've had lately (with a notable exception or two) have been mediocre at best. Still, it's not even been two weeks yet, I don't really see where you drew that conclusion from, lol.

What do you think? -- \nMisfitToys: I've always thought it's rather silly to specifically point out that someone is \\\"generally known as\\\", when the [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (biographies)#Names|Bio policy]] already flatly states that \\\"the article title should generally be the name by which the subject is most commonly known\\\" but that \\\"the subject's full name should be given in the lead paragraph.\\\" (And indeed, this is why the next section points out \\\"It is not always necessary to spell out why the article title and lead paragraph give a different name.\\\" That's the relevant point; it's ''not'' necessary to explain the different name, or ''why'' the article conforms to that policy. If the article title is Ken Summers, then it's obvious that he's commonly known by that name (which is why I suggested moving the article in the first place).  \n\nBased on the conversation is MisfitToys an administrator on Wikipedia? \ni) True\nii) False\n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either True or False with without using any other words.",
    "97": "Hashem sfarim: hello. Since you seem interested in the Weiner scandal article, I thought you should know that editor \\\"Kenatipo\\\" made a couple of edits, that seem a bit POV, and he seems to be acting as an apologist for Breitbart.   Saying that it was unbeknownst to him, and that it was NOT \\\"leaked\\\" to the media.   Yes, we know that Breitbart CLAIMS it was without his permission, but do we know that for sure?   Also, even so, it definitely was leaked to Opie and Anthony by Breitbart, in that specific sense.   I see a lot of blatant POV with Ketipo's latest edits. I was tempted to simply revert them, on that basis, but I wasn't sure if I should.  I'd like your take on it.   Please check out his edits.  I doubt you'd disagree with me regarding their nature.  Thanks. \nMedeis: Well, the statement which Breitbart himself gives is that he showed the photo to the two in confidence, but that they videoed the image from his cell phone screen and published it anyway.  Kenatipo's complaint that the word ''leak'' is a \\\"lie\\\" is a bit shrill, but it is better not to use such a word, especially since a leak is usually done anonymously, and this was rather transparent, if not obvious.  Using the word leak, even if it weren't otherwise objectionable, is less accurate than saying that Breitbart himself admits he showed the two the image but says he did not intend them to share it.  The reader can draw his own conclusions as to whether the outcome pleased Breitbart or not. I have been trying to strictly adhere to the 3RR rule, while I not others haven't.  If you want to edit for clarity, I would suggest you find the relevant words from Breitbart himself and publish as quote with a reference.  That wouldn't count as a revert, but a clarifying expansion according to the source.

    "106": "BD2412: It has a dominant meaning in the sense that virtually every link to Grass was intended for one specific usage of the term - to identify the plant commonly referred to as grass. If you look to the disambig page, you will see that the first term provided has no truly corresponding article ([[lawn]]? turf?; the uses involving personal names and movie titles are so obscure that they would be unlikely to be linked to with this term; the slang terms would be inappropriate links in an encyclopedia; and the rest are acronyms, so the actual term is GRASS, not grass. \nMarshman: I don't disagree it is a dominant meaning.  You are missing the point. What you are doiing is contrary to the purpose and sense of disambiguation pages.  It usurps a term that others could argue should go to their favorite meaning of \\\"grass\\\".  The whole point of having disambiguation pages is to avoid such disputes.  You are opening a dispute here and setting a precedent for other disputes all over Wikipedia by suggesting someone's opinion on a \\\"dominant\\\" use allows them to avoid the disambiguation, while eveeryone else's opinion does not count.  I see that as a troublesome circumventing of a standard that was established to diffuse such disputes, for a very vague gain. - \nMarshman: Have no idea what you mean by \\\"GRASS, not grass\\\".  There is already a redirect for [[GRASS]] - \nBD2412: Some of the terms on the page are abbreviations that would be errantly linked to as [[GRASS]] as opposed to [[grass]] - the point of this change is to take people where they already thought they were going when they clicked on a link to \\\"grass\\\". In retrospect, I agree that [[Poaceae]] is the wrong redirect, as it is simply too hypertechnical to be of interest to the average user - hence, it now links indirectly from the article on grass. This arrangement better suits the population of interest that Wikipedia is growing towards in leaps and bounds - the average internet user. I believe it is an appropriate adjustment to changing times, and to the fact that the number of disambig links is growing at such a rate that it is almost impossible to keep up without making such difficult decisions about what links really should be allowed to fall into disambigs. \nMarshman: Interesting that a newcomer uses the argument \\\"changing times\\\".  You are essentially assuming a lot by your changes and using the argument that you know about this \\\"new\\\" user that has a different use for Wikipedia than the one all the rest of thought we were serving. I still have no idea what you mean by GRASS vs grass, but assume you mean this average internet user would be too unsophisticated to underrstand Poaceae but would know to use GRASS when he means a computer program and grass when he means the stuff on his lawn, but is out of luck if he is looking for something else; well, the latter problem you will solve by making yet another disambiguation page.  The fact is, you have made a page [[grass]] that will now have to become a disambiguation page, because you cannot assume all users will enter by clicking on links only. If your ultimate purpose was just to change [[grass (disambiguation)]] to [[grass]] it would have been easier to just move it over there.  That would be a valid \\\"simplification\\\" since I agree it is better (if the title is free) to avoid \\\"(disambiguation)\\\" in the article name; no one is going to type that in as a \\\"search word\\\". As for links, well links are taken care of (hopefully) by editors linking things correctly. As for difficult decisions, do not assume you have been given that roll; work with others and you won't keep bumping into things. I'l let you finish whatever you think you are doing, but I don't necessarily expect it will stand. - \nMarshman: Rereading, I think I understand your statement about errant links to GRASS vs. grass.  You need to read around the manuals a bit more.  There should be no links that would make such an error.  Of course, that does not mean there are not many in the Wikipedia, but cleaning up disambiguation pages means going to all the places where \\\"grass\\\" appears linked to the disambiguation page and linking it to the correct article based on context. - \nMarshman: As for your final argument, I think you are missing the point that disambiguation pages serve as a sort of release valve, for the many \\\"other\\\" editors whose point of view does not coincide with yours.  And that is why your changes could be creating more difficulty than they solve.  When someone comes in and says \\\"hey, grass is what I just smoked; what is this shit about thin bladed leaves dude?\\\", they go and put a link on the [[grass]] page (being essentially a disambig. page) to their understanding of the term.  Such disambig. pages allow lots of different users to feel their favorite (even if hypertechnical, esoteric, or just plain obscure) term\\/name\\/subject has a link to the article THEY intended to read\\/write. - \nBD2412: I think we're sort of talking past each other here. The average user (and here I'm talking about both editors and casual readers) who makes\\/clicks on a link to grass will expect to see [[grass]]. A botanist consulting Wikipedia to answer a thorny botany question (pun intended) might expect to be taken to [[Poaceae]], but his botanist-rage will be soothed when he sees that the term is linked in the first paragraph. ''No one'' will link to the term (or click the link) anticipating that it leads to author [[G\\xfcnter Grass]] or Nazi [[Angelika Grass]], or the 1925 movie ''[[Grass (1925 movie)|Grass]]''. The pothead who was looking for an entirely different kind of grass will be invited to search [[grass (disambiguation)]] (see [[Rome]] for an example of this principle at work). The purpose of a disambiguation page ''without'' \\\"(disambiguation)\\\" in the title is to accommodate users who search for a term with many strong meanings, or no strong meaning. Grass has one meaning which is overwhelmingly likely to be linked to, so making that meaning the one addressed in the article at that name is a kind of triage to reduce the load of hundreds of new disambig pages that must be fixed each day. By the way, at what point would I no longer be a \\\"newcomer\\\", in your estimation? Cheers! \nMarshman: You will NEVER become anything but a newcomer to me, I've been here far too long. But don't sweat it, you will be able to say the same to the next crop of editors in a few years. - \nBD2412: Okay, old-timer.

Officially, your RfA is still open and is schedule to run until 08:10, 8 August 2010. If you wish to withdraw the RfA (which, IMO, would be a good idea at this point), the technical way to do that is to post a note at the RfA page itself, directly below your original acceptance note. \nJ04n: Hang in there and keep your chin up.

How does it work when a bureaucrat closes an RfA? \\/\nNsk92: See reply at your talk page, [[User talk:Heymid]]. \nExcirial: Just work a bit as an editor in the administrative related area's such as vandalism and newpage patrol, and get some working experience and affinity with the policies related to them (I can guarantee you that they vary quite a bit from FA related rules, and that there are a lot of details). Once people see that you are knowledgeable in those area's you will breeze trough the next RFA. Or alternatively you might conclude that you don't like the maintenance work, and that you prefer writing article's. Either way, keep in mind that an admin is simply a Wikipedian-style cleaner with a bucket on his head, a mop in his hand and some sponge's under his soles. I know it sounds comical, but it is really quite accurate (In a figurative way). An admin is in no way more important or valuable then any other Wikipedian. \nBwrs: Sorry to see your RFA fail.  I was hoping that you could explain yourself better; you could have gotten my Neutral to turn into Support easily. \nOttawa4ever: same here, I voted neutral but that could have easily been a support.

If you want to join the fight against the vandals there are many editors(myself included) who can teach you a few quick pointers to be up on on your way to build up a bit of experince.

A \\\"lemma\\\" in a dictionary or encyclopedia, for example, is the keyword term being looked up.  (Hence, also \\\"dilemma\\\": between two horns.)  Well, I need to check my pillowcase to see if there was more to the story that leaked out overnight.  (And I'm a true scholar!  Only true scholars could get things like this wrong.)  \nPaul August: Well Geogre, you certainly seem scholarly enough to me, but are you sure you are entirely true? You don't always seem completely square to me. And don't protest that you ''are'' a square, that's an entirely different thing. \nJames Sullivan: Don't want to overkill this, but the \\\"lemma\\\" as dictionary entry comes from the tradition of Alexandrian scholarship (that is, in the Museum of Alexandria in the Hellenistic and Roman eras).  In a classical text, if a word, or phrase was being discussed in a commentary, they would print the word or phrase being discussed.  It was thus \\\"taken\\\" out of the text.  The practice continues in modern commentaries.  Now sometimes, when you compare two texts, you may have two different diversions of a sentence, phrase or word.  This presents a \\\"dilemma\\\" in at least two senses, since you have two lemmata and, certainly, a problem.  The difficulty of resolving such dilemmata gave rise to the \\\"horn\\\" imagery, I suppose.  BTW, I performed a bit of organization on the [[History of the Peloponnesian War]] article.  I hope others (who are interested) join me in working on it.  Such a text deserves better treatment than its gotten so far!! \nGeogre: Another case of my scholarly ''bona fides'' follows:  from the immortal [[Flann O'Brien|Myles]]:  \\\"I'm in a bit of a dilemma.  (How do you like his horns?)\\\"  I think in some way the \\\"horn\\\" derivation is somewhat more active, at least among us wordy folk.  It is quite possible that it's associative rather than etymological, that the \\\"lemma,\\\" as heading, derives from \\\"taking\\/clipping,\\\" and that lemmae were so often marked with horn markers that \\\"horn\\\" became a dominant meaning for \\\"lemma\\\" among harmless drudges.  At any rate, whether I am fair or not depends upon whether I am right and regular.  I do what I can about regularity -- proper ruffage and the like -- and, going through every possible angle on a subject, I'm bound to hit 90 degrees sooner or later.   \n\nBased on the conversation is Geogre an administrator on Wikipedia? \ni) True\nii) False\n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either True or False with without using any other words.",

If ''bad blood'' and ''divisive'' are to overstate the problem, then ''constructive'' would be to err in the opposite direction. It has been suggested, that a reason  for the inactivity of WikiProject Logic is that mathematical logic is in the process of cutting its ties to philosophy.  Perhaps, perhaps, but that would be a matter for sociology, or history. Many matters once part of philosophy have left the nest, changed their names, and started families of their own.

I had not imagined that '''editing''' articles on '''logic''' for an '''encyclopedia''' (with no OR) of all things could engender, how should I put it, such \\\"colourful\\\" exchanges.  I imagined I could ignore all that and just write or edit the odd article from time to time.  It is true that I have \\\"scolded\\\" you and other for being rude to one another and suggested we proceed with the cool quite voice of reason.  I can imagine that such remarks can be irritating (\\\"incredibably condescending\\\" I think was one characterisation) but not, per se, rude. No offence to any party has been intended, to you or any others. I '''was''' cross when the Logic logo was abolished and articles split bewteen maths and philosophy and I admit that I thought you had a lot to do with it and have suggested as much on this page.

It seems that there is a need by some to talk about how stupid and ignorant I am. All I ever claim is that there are things that I understand, which other people do not understand, and I am often surprised by it. As far as the \\\"mathpeople\\\" are concerned. That obviously isn't personal. Furthermore, it is an accurate characterization, and there has been at least some conciliation on that issue (although the strong bias isn't going away). I wish that there was discussion by others about the culture here when I first started. This way I would have known more about the pragmatic realities here sooner. I am going to have to make an effort to document these attacks on myself more completely, and wrestle them to the ground, lest we have this kind of impression that you have. Please relent.  \nGregbard: I try to stay focused on the content and concepts. However, I receive more than my share of attacks. They aren't from you, however, you have joined in, when I wished you wouldn't.

You are not the victim.

Stop putting up this smokescreen.  You didn't do what you yourself wanted to do, agreed to do, and could do; but just tried to abuse AFD to hammer other people into doing for you.

This was your first, and the first, comment in this AfD. So you just went straight for my throat. There is no smoke screen. I've said again, and again, on the AfD why I won't work on the article.

It's the only thing that you've ''done''.  You've done nothing at all &mdash; no article edits rewriting what you say should be rewritten, no use of the rename tool to rename what you think should be renamed &mdash; to fix the problem that you knew how to fix, wanted fixed, and had the tools to fix.  You ''are'' doing one thing over and over here, and your only way of dealing with an article that you ''keep saying'' should be cleaned up, with renaming and rewriting, ''is'' not to actually clean it up, but nominate it for deletion again and again.  And you complain that no-one else did your bidding after a mere three days, on top of that.  You are the very problem that you complain of.

You're hiding behind that \\\"I'm attacked.\\\" smokescreen again.  Stop that silliness.)  You've failed again and again to explain why you keep saying \\\"it needs a rewrite and a rename\\\" and why on Earth ''you did not just rewrite and rename'', then, but came to AFD demanding that since neither anyone else ''nor you'' had done this you were going to expend loads of edits (It's somewhere in the 10s, now.) on another AFD nomination instead.  You've not even explained that ''once'', let alone four times.  Now stop hiding behind smokescreens with silliness about nonexistent personal attacks.

Two AFD nominations, taking far more edits to do than rewriting and renaming would have taken.  It's entirely unimpressive.  But yet less impressive still is your response to being asked why you did nothing except nominate for deletion again and again, which is to dodge the question again and again in various ways, laughably try to claim that it's an attack even to be simply asked why you did nothing when you could have ''just done'' what you wanted, and (quite ironically) make personal attacks, yet more of which (alongside yet another failure to answer why on Earth you don't use your own edit and rename tools to do rewrites and renames that you want done, but try to beat other editors into doing the work for you with repeat AFD nominations after a mere three days) I note in the above.<p>Do nothing.  Demand that everyone else do something for you.  Abuse AFD.

Your edit history shows it all, alas.  \nFly by Night: My edit history shows that I've created scores of nice new articles, I've helped out at the reference desks and I've rolled my sleaves up and got stuck in vandal fighting and at [[WP:AIV]].

Try thinking about what ''you'' would think if someone told you not to tell xem that xe was wrong and tried to make out that it was because you didn't care about xem.  That's absurd and transparent manipulation, not to say a foolish over-relativistic argument that the erroneous should be given equal validity to the correct because it's better to pander to manipulative \\\"Don't you care about me?\\\" arguments  than it is to be concerned with doing things correctly and to the benefit of the encyclopaedia and to point out when things are being done wrongly (Fly by Night) and to ask for explanations when something is wholly unexplained (you).

Think!  \nBongomatic: Uncle G's stylistic proclivities aside, renominating an article for deletion instead of renaming it is highly counterproductive and wastes a great deal of time that community members could otherwise be spending productively.

It is not for us to write articles on novel topics that are \\\"similar to the discovery of a new organism\\\", as you say you are doing. Wikipedia is a tertiary source, not for the synthesis of new information. I suggest you  recast the article per Malleus's comments on the article talk page and clear up what he called the article's \\\"identity crisis.\\\" Regards, &mdash;\nMalleus_Fatuorum: I didn't pass anything on to anyone. What I said was that if the article was renominated at GAN and not picked up quickly then I would undertake to do the review. It's my belief from my own experience that Philcha would do a fine job, very likely better than I would have done, and the article would be significantly improved in the the process, so it would be disappointing if it were not renominated. Re your general comments, I think the tenor of the whole discussion surrounding this review started off badly because of the poor decision made by the original reviewer to (effectively) quickfail the article, and has gradually become less and less helpful. I broadly agree with the position that Mattisse has espoused, although I do regret thst she was unable to strike a less gladiatorial tone. The poor experiences some others of us have had with that reviewer earlier also didn't help in producing a more collegial atmosphere, and I'm perhaps as much to blame as anyone for that. Perhaps one day I'll be perfect, but I've still got a ways to go. --\nMoni3: I don't know how to express my disappointment in this ArbCom mentor process. It seems I would basically have to behave like Mattisse to get you folks to do your jobs. Instead, I disengage, remark only about content, refuse to rise to the accusations that I'm synthesizing information and conducting original research, while Mattisse defends an indefensible and astonishingly incompetent GA review. Seriously, is decency so foreign to Wikipedia? I am refusing to renominate the GA, not because I don't think the article does not meet the criteria, but because of the stress and headache I will go through while she rambles on, displaying a complete lack of understanding for core Wikipedia policies. I'm seriously considering abandoning review processes altogether, which is unfortunate because I really would like the articles I write to be the best they can be. Is your desire to be able to end your posts with winky-faces what compels you to be impotent? Do I have to bring out more effective language and say that Mattisse is full of neurotic bullshit, and scream like a mentally imbalanced 14-year-old? Or is this the honest to God best you folks can do? --\nDave souza: [[WP:POT]] evidently applies, I suggest that you strike these aggressive and [[WP:CIV|uncivil]] assertions. A bit more patience and a suitable plea to uninvolved editors is more likely to be succeed than this evidently unproductive name-calling. . . \nMoni3: So yes, it is that sort of language that earns attention. Those who wish to exist outside of this culture are unto themselves, apparently. Someone who creates a melodramatic scene merely hinted at by my previous post makes people uncomfortable, but the respectful decency I employ on a regular basis gives others the impression that things are swell. Mattisse's behavior, obviously, plays no part in this which I find perverse. Conflict forces value reassessment, as is illustrated in many articles on this website, some of which I have written. My passivity and respectfulness has not accomplished that. I am challenging this wiki-culture that follows such a status-quo. I heartily dislike using hurtful language, but it is the equivalent to laying down in front of the Food and Drug Administration in a public die-in to get arrested in front of the media. If I have to start peppering my posts with \\\"fuck\\\" and start ranting about conspiracy, might that inspire action as well? How about if her mentors start addressing her behavior so articles can be improved? --\nLing.Nut: I never saw your posts about sending sources etc. I un-volunteered my help 'cause I'm busy and 'cause Philcha would do as well or better than i could. But I re-volunteer. Go ahead and send me those sources, if you want, although I believe there is no need to do so, because I believe your contributions are completely in order and above reproach. \nMattisse: The ArbCom mentor]\\/adviser process is working well, from my point of view, and over time I have received  honest and timely advice from my advisers. Regarding your article, I have given my opinion at GAR and on the article talk page (where I understood  Geometry guy to say comments should go), which I am  allowed to do. You are free to ignore my comments, or to argue against them on the article talk page. It is unclear what you are expecting of me now. I never indicated any interest in  rewriting the article or in reviewing it for a second GAN. Perhaps those who offered to review your article, should you renominate it, will be interested in your materials. I agree the article would emerge improved from a renomination should Philcha or Malleus do the review. If you want to refuse to renominate the article, then that is up to you.  I do ask that you stop repeatedly  posting disparaging remarks about me and my mentoring\\/advising process on my talk page. Regarding, &mdash;\nPhilcha: Mattisse, I think it's time to put this incident behind you - as I've noticed to-day, you have some new interests that I hope will give you more enjoyment.--\nPhilcha: PS I think that applies to ''everyone'' else too. --\nMattisse: Thanks!

    "162": "Volunteer Marek: There's very obviously a dispute about the neutrality of the article - in particular the wording in the lede - going on the discussion page at the moment. So your removal of the NPOV tag was completely unjustified. The fact that this is a current event rather than something with \\\"history\\\" (whatever that means) appears to be completely irrelevant. I would appreciate it if you restored the tag.\nCerejota: I see no issues on neutrality, I see issues on source relevancy and verifiability. --\nVolunteer Marek: The neutrality issue concerns him being described as a \\\"Zionist\\\". This is being discussed on the talk page.\nCerejota: I understood that. See the issue is there is nothing about neutrality about that. No reliable sources are claiming this as false, and the sources presented are all generally known to be pro-Zionist themselves (Jpost, JTA etc). This means there is no neutrality issues present, as neutrality implies two sides of a debate in the reliable sources. Such other side is not present, hence no neutrality issues - there is no debate on neutrality. There is a debate on your part on inclusion of verifiable, reliable sources interpretation of Breivik's own words, and that is another matter. --\nVolunteer Marek: No, the problem is that the sources don't call him \\\"Zionist\\\". They say his manifesto has some \\\"Zionist\\\" stuff in it. Two different things. Additionally, this is obviously a sick individual who also calls himself a \\\"Knight Templar\\\". You can't take his words at face value. This should be obvious to anyone who's not out to push an agenda and (disgustingly) try to use this tragic incident to advance some political cause. Hence, it's not neutral. The fact that you happen to fall on a particular side of a neutrality debate does not mean that such a debate does not exist.\nCerejota: That is still not a neutrality issue, its a verifiability issue.--\nVolunteer Marek: No, because there's no question about whether the sources can be verified. They can. It's just that 1) they don't say what the Wikipedia article claims they say and 2) they are given undue weight given the nature of the article topic.\nCerejota: [[WP:SOAPBOX|Wikipedia is not a debate society]], its an encyclopedia anyone can edit, including yourself. I suggest you make use of this ability. Tagging doesn't improve the article, conscientious editing does. --\nCerejota: You are ignoring the rather long explanation I gave in article talk (were we should be discussing this, not here). You are wrong in your appreciation of this particular case, and if you feel that I am in violation of policy, fell free to seek [[WP:DR|dispute resolution]]. It will become clear to you that it is in fact your inclusion of irrelevant material that is at fault.--\nTeapeat: I'm sorry, but you're flat wrong. This is explicitly allowed by the policy.\nCerejota: You are treating a section of policy as the whole and missing the point entirely. I am not going to wikilawyer this anymore, as there seems to be no way to convince you of your incorrect reading of policy. As I said, take it to DR if you feel strongly about it.--\nTeapeat: This isn't a narrow reading of a single section of policy. Self published sources are correctly considered reliable sources under certain conditions which match how the manifesto is being used. Your removal of it is inappropriate.\nCerejota: [[WP:WIKILAWYER|*Yawn*]]...--\nHydrox: I am very upset and frustrated. Please put back all the <nowiki><ref name=\\\"manifesto\\\" \\/><\\/nowiki> tags that you removed. What you are doing is both insensitive and not supported by the alleged policy on reliable sources. There is an ongoing discussion about your actions on the talk page, which you seem to have ignored. --\nHydrox: I undid your edits. Please discuss before taking the ref's away again. Cheers, \nCerejota: Its funny you un-did them, because then in talk you seem to support them. Anyways, I was not ignoring any discussion, you can tell from my edit history I always discuss all my edits and furthermore, create edit summaries. --\nCerejota: Who decided those quotes are relevant, worthy of inclusion, and encyclopedic? You did. How did you do it? By engaging in [[WP:OR]]. Can't argue otherwise. Also please learn to use the new section button in talk pages.--\nHydrox: Hello, sorry I seem to have missed the previous talk page discussion when making above comments - there was a previous discussion on the issue indeed. I support selectively, cautiously and responsibly using the manifesto as a source, but I am naturally strongly against anyone publishing personal interpretations in WP. Thus, I don't support removing the references, but peer-reviewing them, and removing any questionable ones when encountered. --\nCerejota: Then we agree fully. My fear is that so far, most editors have unwittingly engage din OR when using it. Peer-review and extensive discussion of any quotation before inclusion seems a good idea. --\nHydrox: My current proposal is to include an editnotice (a warning that is shown to all editors) to the page, warning of using the primary source in a manner not permitted by the policy, and monitoring the page for primary source abuse. But I am not for removing or <nowiki>{{fact}}<\\/nowiki>'ing well-sanctioned use of the manifesto from the article as of now. --\nCerejota: I like that idea of the edit notice, however the part about sanction needs to be processed more.

It simply looks like people respond to the Category Needed category better than the other lists.  It seems like I've seen several articles that have been orphaned and uncategorized for months - if I slap an uncat tag on it, someone puts it in a legitimate category within an hour or so.  Maybe that's my imagination though... \\u2014\nNunh-huh: Well, it's usually a bad idea to let \\\"complaints and disagreements\\\" cause one to \\\"disrupt Wikipedia to make a point\\\". And even though you don't find it peculiar to have a category on an \\\"uncategorized\\\" article, I think it is self-evidently so. Even if some hypothetical person finds this \\\"uncategory category\\\" useful, there does not seem to be any reason to uglify these articles by placing a giant flashing template at the top announcing the article \\\"needs\\\" a category. I would suggest if you must add this \\\"category\\\" to articles, you simply do so without the flashing neon sign. - \nwknight94: Wow!  When did legitimate cleanup tags become a violation of [[WP:POINT]]?!  I'm simply going by the [[WP:CGZ]] guideline which says every article should be in a category so I'm not sure what the problem is.  Should we abolish categories and cleanup in general since they uglify articles?  How about just adding a category ''like authors are supposed to do in the first place?''  And I'm clearly not the only person who finds it peculiar to use the {{tl|uncat}} tag since it - and the Category-needed category in general - were created long before I arrived.  \\u2014\nNunh-huh: The dogma that \\\"every article belongs in a category\\\" refers to ''useful'' categories - and that ought to mean useful to the readers, since they far outnumber the editors. People ''using'' Wikipedia have no need to read, before they get to any useful content, a paragraph about how the article \\\"needs\\\" a category. CGZ is in any case a guideline, not a policy, and I think it's one you're misinterpreting. 'Every article needs a category so I'll add a category that says \\\"uncategorized\\\"' is silly. And the intrusive tag at the top of the article in fact degrades the article's utility. Such editorial tags which serve no purpose to the ''users'' of Wikipedia do not belong on the article page: if needed at all, they belong on the talk page. - \nW.marsh: Well no, like I say you aren't doing anything wrong, I'm just hoping we can find a solution. I am not sure what consensus is on the purpose of category needed, but it would be nice if we could timely address all of the requests in under a week or so. --\nW.marsh: Yes, it was kind of my hope that it could be a place where new (and newly unearthed) articles can be categorized quickly. It was like that for about... a week, hehe. I guess that's not practical. --\nW.marsh: Personally I think we should ''require'' a category and an incoming link for people to create an article. But that'd probably never fly. --\nYendor1958: The paragraph that you are unhappy with appears wherever the {{tl|uncat}} template is inserted. It might be better if it were always positioned at the bottom of the article, where the category would normally be entered. To my mind adding an article to the uncat'ed category has the desirable effect of dynamically adding an article to what is a to-do list. It also will show as an edit to the article which may attract the attention of the author to the need to categorize. And finally it might act as a pointer for a newbie like myself to a potential way to contribute, when they may feel as I do, that they are unable to commit the time to write articles. I see the process of adding a category to an uncat article as analogous to putting an unclassified book on the shelf with associated topics, instead of leaving it sitting in a big heap. -- \n\nBased on the conversation is Yendor1958 an administrator on Wikipedia? \ni) True\nii) False\n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either True or False with without using any other words.",

Please knock it off.  Thank you.  \nSlicky: It's not that i absolutely resent his ideas. But from my POV it is favourable to have at least a stub even if blatantly copy-pasted (as long as it is only an excerpt) for as long as someone else finally has the time, and in most cases it is me anyways, to write the article in his own terms with further research. e.g. [[STED microscope]] is now fixed. So gimme a break. Each and everyone here is entitled to his own opinion, and although you are right in principle, there is now way someone would ever make a law suit for a small excerpt that is equipped with the according link, along with the fact that wikipedia is non-profit etc. Proof me wrong and show me a precedence-case, if not i'll stick to it, in good hope that more people get to more information faster, which is all i am interested in, as i expect the same from wikipedia. \nChristopher Thomas: I'm afraid you're going to have to take the five minutes to write at least a single-sentence stub on your own.

However in the long run the article SHOULD get ammended, and as there is no such thing as a work-pool for intermediary content i am convinced this is the best way. Just look at the quality of most new articles and how well researched and objective they are in about a year. However you are doing even more harm by not trying to be more constructive. e.g. the licencing.

My work mostly involved issues of federal jurisdiction, the scope of protective orders in document discovery, procedural aspects of multi-district litigation, conflicts of laws issues, and class action certification.  You are surely not suggesting that I have a conflict of interest with all of the clients and business partners of all of my former employers, because that would suggest that only teenagers and the habitually unemployed can edit Wikipedia articles.

I have edited with those from all belief systems and philosophies, and almost always with no issues. The problem is when those beliefs or associations affect ''how one edits'', which is why Pastordavid is an administrator and Jason Gastrich is banned. It is why [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration\\/Agapetos angel|Agapetos angel]] is banned - and please note Agapetos angel did '''not''' reveal her identity, but was nevertheless banned for editing contrary to COI - although I believe this was before COI was written, and the specifics were for edit warring, POV, etc. Agapetos angel was one of those \\\"thousands who hide their POV\\\" and yet was banned. In short, I think that although the concerns you raise are valid, they are misapplied in this case. \nATren: I agree with what you are saying, and that's why I am still waiting to see one diff that shows problematic editing on the part of THF. I'm not saying there are none - I haven't interacted with THF much so I honestly don't know - but if there are, then the people making the COI accusations should provide those diffs for us to examine.

As we are aware at the Pittsburgh project there is a movement to standardize all infobox colors on wikipedia, however for the most part still optional.  I could take this opportunity to remind you that it is a similar policy to that of checking and even contributing to the discussion page of a wikipage you may want to fundamentally change (I do use fundamentally because anyone with knowledge about the region would immediately remember that this is the only city known to mankind that has all professional sports teams draped in the same colors, that of the city flag, seal, police cars, some fire units, and even (get this!) the fire hydrants (yes they aren't red they are black and gold)).  So just as some editors take the option of not checking the discussion page chock full of people with knowledge on the subject matter nor leaving comment or views on it before undertaking such a fundamental change, most of us in and around the Pittsburgh project take the option of having our wiki infobox the same color as every civic identity (sports, law enforcement, emergency services, government) in this region.

That activist is actively engaged in editing Wikipedia articles in his area of activism. We all know of cases where that kind of editing has turned out poorly, even where we might have supported the activist's causes.

Please consider having some kind of discussion with Will Beback.  --\nWill Beback: LAEC links to his blog and website from his user page, and those websites contain his name.

On the contrary, by making yourself available to the media you've made yourself a public person in regard to library issues.] Now that I'm getting a better picture of the problem, it goes beyond simple COI and look more like advocacy. Editors have been banned for using Wikipedia as a platform for advocacy. There have been complaints about your editing for years. Soliciting meatpuppets on FreeRepublic, which you've done, is against policy. And that was just two weeks ago.

    "259": "Utahredrock: Please learn to be more civil, yesterday I laughed at your attacks. Right now they are just getting old.--\nTvoz: It's not personal, Utahredrock, please stop casting it that way.  I sincerely recommend, again, that you look into [[WP:MENTOR]] to help you learn about procedure and Wikipedia etiquette.  You are enthusiastic, but you're not getting it.  I'm not the only editor who has told you this - take a look at the exchanges you've had with other editors about [[WP:CANVASS|canvassing]], for example. On [http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/w\\/index.php?title=User_talk%3AUtahredrock&diff=223956012&oldid=223928838 July 6] Noroton cautioned you about canvassing and gave you the policy link; you [http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/w\\/index.php?title=User_talk:Noroton&diff=prev&oldid==223956784 acknowledge it].   I followed up in agreement and pointed out that the policy had already been articulated on a talk page of an article you were working on - you said you hadn't seen it - fine.  But then on [http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/w\\/index.php?title=Talk%3AJohn_McCain&diff=224069955&oldid=224059354  July 7] you go ahead and canvass on [[John McCain]], in a non-neutral manner. It's pointed out to you and you say you don't agree that it was canvassing.  A third editor, Bobblehead, comes in on [http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/w\\/index.php?title=User_talk%3AUtahredrock&diff=224457245&oldid=224316706 July 8] and lays it out for you again. [[WP:CANVASS]] is one of the more clearly-written policies, and is not ambiguous or subject to much interpretation - \\\"neutrally-worded friendly reminders\\\" posted on pages of all people involved in a discussion, without saying what your preference is.  That you made a mistake and inadvertently  canvassed is no big deal - this is not intuitive. But why is it you didn't go back and correct it yourself?  Saying that other people can delete your note is not the point, is it.  Anyway, this is just one example.  It's been pointed out to you  by several editors that your participation in the AfD is veering toward [[WP:OWN|ownership]] and is way over the top - but you keep on going. This isn't a personal crusade, or it shouldn't be, and saying over and over again that ''you'' think a person is notable, and using hyperbole and irrelevant sources and adding long passages about why you think the person is important and making political comments is not helping your case - and it's just not appropriate for an AfD. I and others  mentioned this to you before - replying to specific points is ok, but inundating the page is not. I could go on, but there's no point.  If you want to be a successful editor here, try listening more and talking less, and for heaven's sake take other people's advice.  No one is attacking you.  I hope you'll get the message, and, again, consider mentoring.  And, as I already asked you, please stop talking about me and bandying my name all over your talk page and elsewhere -  it's rude and unacceptable. Find someone else to focus on. I do not want the job as your coach, and I am frankly tired of talking to you  - it seems to make no difference and I have other things to do.  <strong>\nUtahredrock: Tvoz, Regarding canvassing in particular I feel I took yours and others advice. I did reword my request on the McCain page (with an emphasis on toning it down) but did not delete it because I thought it was relevant. I invited others to delete it because I didn't care that much--and clearly others had another view. Somebody finally did delete it. I sincerely just wanted more input at Abongo. I had posted something on the Obama page first--a day or two previous--which I was accused of not doing at all. The last time I checked it was still there. I value your input. You may not feel that I value your input, but I do. I don't agree with everything, but that's a different story. I also feel your advice has been offered and received in the spirit of mentoring, though clearly I disagree with you enough to make that a problematic association. I do feel I listen to you and I do think you're a good editor, maybe a great one. But not always right and nor am I. I have not bandied your name around beyond any discussions\\/debates we've been involved in. I can not promise I will not mention your name if it is relevant to positions you've taken or that we've debated. These are, after all, part of the wiki-record. It's truly nothing personal. You've taken some strong stances and I have too. I feel you've gone overboard and attacked me. I forgive you for this, but it seems unreasonable to request that I not mention your name. I will refrain from commenting on your talk page any more unless you give me permission. That seems like an odd request on your part, but I'll honor it. Please reply on my talk page if you have anything else to say about me or my editing. In the meantime I will honor my word and say nothing else on your talk page. Cheers,--\nS.

What you want is fine, I'm just asking that you do it in a way that allows correct including of the categories in additional category trees.  For example.  The companies need to roll up into the various company categories.  A category with beers and companies should not be rolled up into a company category since beers are not companies.  If your lowest level is beer and breweries, then every brewery article must be tagged to a company category.  If the breweries are in a category, then they get rolled up into both a company category and your beer and brewery category.  If you use your beer and breweries category, then it would included two subcategories, one for the beers which would also be included in the appropriate brands category and one for the companies that would also be included in the appropriate company category.  Basically you seem to be missing my point that the way categories work there is no problem in what you want to do and what the rest of wikipedia is doing.   Everything can be placed in the existing major categories and in the variants that you want for beer related topics.  Categories are not intended to be structured so that there is only a single parent.  They can branch off in many different directions.  \nSilkTork: Yes, I am focusing on the needs and situation of the beer and brewery topics. You appear to be focusing on the needs of the category system. The category system is in place to assist readers navigate and editors to organise.

We have [[Spitfire (beer)]] which is dealt with in a section within [[Shepherd Neame Brewery]] (both beer and brewery), and [[Mort Subite]] dealt with within [[Alken-Maes]] (both beer and brewery) for example. The way that you propose to arrange it then those articles will need to have both beer brand and beer brewery categories placed within the same article. We are not going to get a neat separation (even though organisationally it may be desirable), because in the beer world it unfortunately doesn't exist. We either tag every brewery with both beer brand and beer company tags, or we keep the existing tag which already does that! Are you starting to see the situation?

There are no free images that would replace the band shot, and one cannot be made now as two of the people in the shot are dead. Syd Barratt I'm not so sure about.  Yes, it was taken at a particular moment in time (so you would need that time machine), but there may be free images of Syd Barratt taken at around that time (1975) that would show his drastically altered appearance, which is the significance of the image. However, if these do not exist, then there is no chance of making one now as he is dead.--\nRama: The question is not whether the image ''is'' replaced, but whether it ''can'' be replaced. You are using random images for decorative purposes; Fair Use is for critical discussion of specific media that are the subject of the article, not for suplementing a lack of Free media by snatching random, copyrighted media without asking. See [[Wikipedia:Non-free content\\u200e]] and my explanations at [[User:Rama\\/Fair use]]. \nRama: As for making images of dead people, painting and drawing have been used for centuries with some success. Simply because one person is not willing or capable of creating an image does not mean that it is impossible to create the image in question. \nParrot of Doom: Random images?  Nonsense.  The Pink Floyd group image best illustrates the two phases of the group.  There isn't one that could do it better.  The Syd Barrett image, if you'd read anything of the history of Wish You Were Here you'd understand its significance.  I suggest that before you arbitrarily delete images that '''you''' think shouldn't be there, you ask first why they exist.

Which is not what Fair Use is about. \nElen of the Roads: Could you point to the place in the Fair Use policy where it says all that?  If you can't, could you stop making it up please. \nParrot of Doom: (edit conflict) I can, actually, and I've more than demonstrated an adequate rationale on each image description.

As there is a dispute over these images, they should go through a deletion discussion.\nRama: \\\"''Images with iconic status or historical importance: As subjects of commentary.''\\\". Listen, it's just trivial to look up, could you take the care of actually reading these policies before arguing over them? \nRama: The article says nothing of these images. They are not the subject of the article, or even of portions of it, but are used \\\"''only to visually identify elements in the article''\\\", which \\\"''should be used as sparingly as possible. Consider restricting such uses to major characters and elements or those that cannot be described easily in text, as agreed to by editor consensus.''\\\".

A caption that ready \\\"Syd Barrett, visiting Abbey Road Studios in July 1975\\\" is ''not'' a critical commentary. ''[[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]]'' is. Note the difference. \nElen of the Roads: I wondered if that was what happened. Is there scope for a proper deletion discussion - my own feeling is that the first FUR is fine and the second probably so, given that it is a picture of a precise moment in time, but I appreciate that the views of others do vary. \nParrot of Doom: I suggest you do as I've already typed.  You clearly don't have a clue about the history of the articles these images are used in.  Next you'll be deleting all album cover articles, and replacing them with childish drawings.

    "378": "APTOC: Thank you in advance. \nGalassi: There are a few problems with your edits. There is the question of attribution and origin of the material, as well as possibly tenuous connection to Bandera in view of his incarceration. There is is also the question of your edits on RuWiki, which show a large anti-Ukrainian bias and avid use of unreliable sources.--\nAPTOC: That is exactly what I thought initially, but wanted to ask to ensure that I am not mistaken in regards to your grounds (and I see that I was not). Your answer has no facts - just generic statements (while my addition has every line backed by references). In regards to your answer, I agree that the best defense is offence. However one shouldn't try to offend by giving knowingly false statements (ALL my changes on Ru Wiki went through a discussion AND approval by the community and despite such a sensitive area my actions have never resulted in being blocked). Now let's get closer to the topic. One shouldn't try to cover all the criminal actions of Ukrainian nationalists against Jewish people during WW2 by labeling it \\\"large anti-Ukrainian bias\\\". I feel bad for you that you feel this way, but so far every addition on other Wiki was legitimate and true and backed by sources that were confirmed in separate discussions. I\\u2019ll ignore \\\"large anti-Ukrainian bias\\\", but I'd ask to retain from future insults.  I do love Ukraine. (I don't want to comment on your migration from Ukraine to US as I am not sure how Patriotic this action is towards Ukraine, but unlike other people I don't like to judge others as it\\u2019s your own thing). Now let's get to EN Wiki. First you accused the changes to be wrong because of the content having grammatical errors. Then you have questioned one of the sources that were removed. Now, you try to make up some statements about the person who made the change (which is worse since those statements are not only inappropriate, but false). Let's discuss the content and not people. Would it be ok from your end? I hope it is. Until you can prove that something that has multiple references is wrong it will be in the article. Denial of truth and hidden anti-Semitic views are not a good strategy. Jews are equal people and they (and their memory) do not deserve being discriminated by anyone. I'd ask you not to begin a war of corrections until you have some facts. In such cases you should first provide alternative opinion instead of removing. I'd ask you to retain from removing from Wiki such large portions of text that has sources only because it contradicts to your personal believes. Wiki is not a sand box - people have to have very clear grounds for each one of the actions (both additions and removal). It has clearly defined rules for any action and I'd ask you to follow those. In addition, in the future, please feel free to correct grammar for other people if you see any mistakes and please don't remove the entire block. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. \nGalassi: Read up on [[WP:COATRACK]], and do read the discussion page before adding controversial material. Your edits on the Pidgajnyj article were preposterous, and are only possible on RuWiki, where the antiUkrainian sentiment is acceptable. You might be better off there.--\nLvivske: ''hidden anti-Semitic views are not a good strategy'', Galassi ;) --'''\nAPTOC: Sorry, I see that you are not capable of having a normal conversation.

English style seems to favour uppercase in cases like this (see [[:Category:British cathedrals]] for many examples). \nNixdorf: See [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions]]. \nUppland: My personal inclination would be to regard \\\"Uppsala Cathedral\\\" ''together'' as a proper noun, in contrast with Swedish practice but in analogy with e.g. the names of British cathedrals. I think that would be better English. A Swedish analogy would be [[Uppsala University]], which has an uppercase U, although Swedish uses lowercase for the second word. \nNixdorf: Well I'm not certain as to what applies. The church does not officially call itself \\\"Uppsala Cathedral\\\" The Swedish name is ''Uppsala domkyrka'' unless the church has themselves capitalized the first letter in \\\"Domkyrka\\\". We have a rule in Swedish that organizations are to determine for themselves how their names shall be capitalized. \nBishonen: Hi, Nixdorf. User:Uppland asked me for a second opinion about the capitalization, and I thought I might as well weigh in here. I'm Swedish, too. The rule that organizations determine their own capitalization can't be transposed from Swedish to English usage the way you're doing, IMO. Don't you find Uppland's analogy of Uppsala universitet versus Uppsala University convincing..? I do. The organization itself\\u2014Uppsala University\\u2014has indeed determined both the \\\"Uppsala universitet\\\" and the \\\"Uppsala University\\\" spelling\\u2014both appear on their letterhead. The reason the organization has capitalized itself one way in Swedish and a different way in English is of course that they're aware of the difference between English and Swedish usage on this point.

Not trying to be pushy, you've just got me really curious as to where you were headed with the link... :) \nFainites: Just for alt text. Giving the ''horsey'' colour plus a ''description'' of the colour. Like \\\"Dun (sandy brown with dark points)\\\" type of thing. For ordinary text you can link the colour. \nDana boomer: Ah, gotcha. Yeah, all of us in the discussion are fairly familiar with the various specialized horse colors. It's just figuring out what the alt text gurus (i.e. Eublides, etc) want that is the issue. Also, having a set policy for this sort of thing will make it easier when we're dealing with random editors trying to add alt text to breed articles and using terms that visually impaired readers may not understand, and not being willing to add normal colors to it, as is happening in one of the other breed articles right now. \nFainites: Well alt text for the visually impaired is obviously needed so I suppose there could be an almost standard description of colours. But also I don't think these colours are necessarily the same worldwide are they? Do you have strawberry roans in the US? Do the Brits have cremellos? Do either of those mean a thing to non-horsey types? \nMontanabw: Hee Hee!  I was the lead editor on the last big cleanup of [[Equine coat color]].  For the alt text, we have two issues.  One is the question of using \\\"weird horse words\\\" in general --doe we say  dun instead of tan, bay instead of \\\"reddish-brown with a black mane and tail\\\" or do we do both?  \\\"Golden-colored horse (palomino),\\\" for example.  The UK vs US English question is probably simpler because we can use the same standards for alt text as for article text itself, I think.  If it's UK English, we have a piebald, if US, we have a Black and White pinto.  Yes, we have strawberry roans, by the way, though people, including the AQHA, are trying to call chestnut base coat roans red roans now (I was taught that a bay roan was the red roan, but never mind...)    You may find [[Roan (horse)]], interesting.  We are discussing the terminology question there to sort it all out. Dana, is it OK we are all hijacking your talk page for this?  LOL!\nFainites: Both!

    "400": "Scottperry: After some reflection, I agree with both of you regarding the hope to remove the policing of \\\"unstated conclusions\\\" out of Wikipedia altogether.  I've done some historical research on the WP:NOR article, and it turns out that that \\\"nutshell\\\" template-type box at the top that includes wording about \\\"original thought\\\" and \\\"synthesis\\\" was first placed there in 2006. I think that it is probably safe to say that prior to that, there was no official Wikipedia policing attempting to deal with any unstated conclusions. No  stated policy on this, and not even an implied policy on it.  That template was put there by SlimVirgin, and agreed to by a now banned administrator, Jossi.  Once the template box was placed there stating that Wikipedia does not publish \\\"original thought', I think it was only a matter of time before WP:SYN was developed in all of its now more full-blown amazing contra-logical ramifications.  \n{unknown-4265}: I suspected something of that nature had happened: most people, after months, do not really get stuck-on-an-opinion, but generally, many people will tend to \\\"go with the flow\\\" months later, until they detect some severe mindsets, and then they usually drift away from that trouble. At this point, similar to a [[WP:NPOV_dispute]], I would begin a formal discussion subpage, seeking a new consensus, and meanwhile, if anyone claimed WP:SYN to delete text, I would inform them how the policy has been suspended, pending a revision which all can accept.

It's a great movie though, and I'm enjoying Stone's fleshing it all out. I'm re-reading John Rewald's long essay ''Theo Van Gogh As Art Dealer'' in his ''Studies in Post-Impressionism'' - I just learned that Adolphe Goupil partnered up with uncle Vincent and began to buy and sell original works of art, (as opposed to just his brisk business in high quality prints) and Goupil hired Frenchman Michel Knoedler to open an operation in New York. Which eventually became the famous NYC Knoedler Gallery...\nModernist: The US operation emanating out of the 1860s eventually opened the door to the American market, American collectors acquiring and amassing fantastic collections especially in high quality Impressionism and Post-Impressionism in the 1880s and 1890s...\nTruthkeeper88: I think it's all very fascinating actually and yesterday as I was working through the page, wondered what happened to Vincent's collection.

I visited Silvia Beach's bookstore the same night and stayed in a hotel on the street where Hemingway and Ezra lived - this is before I began working on any of these articles and knew any of this, but it's odd stuff that I love learning about. \nModernist: That's a great link, especially in light of what you were wondering yesterday about those images. It's amazing what happens with our memories. We forget and then we see something that opens the floodgates to our memory, so many things in life change, and wipe clean the circumstances.

For situations like that, can we use the photos from the NRHP nom or are they not Fed Gov't works? '''\nDaniel Case: Add any apparently-no-longer-extant buildings [[Wikipedia:WikiProject National Register of Historic Places\\/NRIS information issues\\/New York#Demolished but still listed|here]].

Mendelson and Son Company Building]], but yours just blows it away. And you got a good one for [[Lafayette Park Historic District]]. Perhaps I should get you down here to take some better pictures at some point :-).<p>As for the Abrams Building pics, there ''has'' been some discussion of the copyright status of pictures filed by states with their applications ... I think the feeling was that they might become free by virtue of being kept as federal government property, but I'm not totally clear about that. You could try seeing if there were any HABS images, which ''would'' be PD-US (but might not necessarily represent the building as it was prior to demolition), and failing all else you've got an unassailable fair-use rationale for the state pics (\\\"building has been demolished; cannot create new image\\\". \nDaniel Case: '''744\\u2013750 Broadway'''. Wow! They look so much better. I was thinking of your images today when I was out with my son, where I got some more images of my own for [[Downtown Ossining Historic District]] (Would you believe that's actually longer than [[Central Troy Historic District) that might make me content enough with it to go to PR and then GA at least, among other things. A few weeks ago I saw that the [[Mountainville Grange Hall]] has been thoroughly renovated into a day-care center, with some small additions and the installation of tan [[vinyl siding]], to the point that I'm wondering if it retains enough historical integrity ... I have a picture of it but I haven't uploaded yet. Likewise, the [[House at 249 Main Street]] has been spiffed up and repainted in tan (it looks that way in the picture but that was because a cloud was covering the sun and I didn't feel like waiting; it was actually yellow). And now those buildings on Broadway have been made to look almost as good as new ... just when you thought you were done, you have to start over again :-). \nCamelbinky: If the missing bridge you speak of is the Whipple cast-iron bridge in the NRHP listings in Albany, NY then I can tell you it is still there. The address listed is technically correct and incorrect- while at one point 1000 Delaware Ave would have been correct, the road today is Normanskill Drive. Take Delaware south heading from the heart of Albany towards Delmar and Bethlehem, cross the Thruway, then on the right, across (and maybe slightly before the entrance) to Graceland Cemetary is a narrow badly paved steep sloping heavily forested road, it is Normanskill Drive, the old route of the Delaware Turnpike. About three-quarters of the way to the Normans Kill, on the right is the Whipple truss bridge, leading into Steven's Farm (Normanskill Farm), a city-owned farm and public park. Photos of the old yellow brick bridge at the end of this road would be appreciated as well, and if you are up to some hiking pictures of the farm and Normans Kill and ruins of the old mills and ice houses would be nice as well. You might get lucky and see some of the police force's K-9 and mounted patrols as both the horses and dogs are kept there and trained there.\nUpstateNYer: Yep, just found it. {{coord|42|38|8.86|N|73|48|1.62|W|region:US|display=inline}} '''\nCamelbinky: I look forward to some more great pictures.

Covering those bricks was terrible, but along the edges and in potholes you can still see the yellow bricks and of course the old bridge still has them along with a nicely maintained section on the Bethlehem side of the stream. \n\nBased on the conversation is Camelbinky an administrator on Wikipedia? \ni) True\nii) False\n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either True or False with without using any other words.",

The tensions between the Morgan-Tian team, on the one hand, and Yau, on the other, are well-known.  This alone would be enough to make Birman's comment irrelevant.  Furthermore, she is certainly a respected mathematician, but her exceptional notability is yet to be established.  In addition, her comments about peer review and refereeing miss the point entirely, in my view.  The whole point is that technically speaking, there was absolutely nothing wrong with Yau's announcement that his students were the first to publish a complete proof.  This was, in fact, correct.  If there is anybody who knows anything about the subject, it is Yau himself, and so no objections could be raised to the publication of their long paper on the grounds that it was not refereed properly.

    "447": "Wehwalt: Why the theory of evolution?  And what transportation?  Agree with the rest of it.--\nMattisse: Darwin was in the group. I have been copy editing Darwin articles lately, like ''[[Origin of the Species]]''. It is impossible to underestimate the importance of this. I copyied the rest of the phrase from the [[Industrial Revolution]] article. But also look at the [[Industrialization]] article. It is ridiculous to assert that Boulton was a major driver of this. Best to remove the implication. &mdash;\nWehwalt: Erasmus Darwin, actually, but I guess he presaged his grandson's work enough from what I can see.  Plainly there are different views of what drove the industrial revolution.  If you read what I wrote, I refer to the engine driving it, not Boulton.  I think it is right.  Causation chains are difficult to deal with.--\nMattisse: Yes, he did presage his grandson.  The Watt engine contributed to the Industrial Revolutions, but so did an enormous number of other things. To say one engine, one version of the steam engine, \\\"drove\\\" the revolution is a massive statement. However, if you want to root around in industrialization articles, to provide your point, be my guest as they say. I feel this is a red herring in the article, but if you feel it is worth holding up the article  to  \\\"prove\\\" this point, that is your choice. I feel that Boulton does not need this extraneous baggage to be an interesting, notable, historically interesting person. A creative businessman, yes. Did he personally design the coins, develop the processes etc. or did those that he hired?  I say ditch the hype about driving industrialization, unless you want to immerse yourself in the history of industrialization in Britain. Personally, I do not think you will find anything. \\\"My view\\\" - disclaimer! &mdash;\nWehwalt: I may make it clearer that it is opinion.  You are correct, how do you say in a myriad of factors which \\\"drove\\\" and which didn't?  And no, Boulton didn't design the coins.  As near as I can tell, he waved the wand.  He may have done designing of the machines, but he made almost nothing with his own hands.--\nMattisse: I am not clear how much he actually \\\"designed\\\". He saw the potential in the design and he encouraged Watt to do it. But mainly, it appears to me, he was a business man who fascilitated others to do the designing necessary for his business. Therefore, how much should the article get into proving he \\\"drove\\\" anything. Even the pictures of the designs suggested are not \\\"his\\\", and therefore unnecessary to the article, in my opinion. &mdash;\nWehwalt: He designed things like the mint machinery; Watt designed the engines and I think Boulton helped make them practical by designing the processes by which they could be made.  Anyway, I think you are right about the Industrial Revolution.  I can't definitively say that the machines triggered, or drove, or whatever, the Industrial Revolution, and so the article shouldn't say it.  I've left a comment on the FAC page.  You keep me honest.--\nMattisse: It's only for your own good!  &mdash;\nWehwalt: That's what they told the tomcat before his operation!

The 4th edition of the IHO's ''Limits of Oceans and Seas'' was never ratified or published - I tried to explain this and give a neutral POV. I would appreciate discussion rather than reversion. Regards \nCkatz: I've re-reworked that section, and would also appreciate it if it could remain stable until we resolve this. Your changes there (and in other ocean articles) are problematic in that they suggest the Southern Ocean is still a \\\"work in progress\\\", when in fact it is an active concept in use by the IHO and other world bodies. Any changes would need to reflect that fact, which is evidenced by the IHO's working groups, other marine organizations, and even the CIA World Factbook, all of which use the Southern Ocean terminology. (You are correct in that the 1953 guide does not include the Southern Ocean, but the problem lies in that your rewrites suggest the Southern Ocean term will not take effect until the 4th editon is published, which does not reflect the actual use today.) Given that the Oceans project has already seen fit to implement the Southern Ocean, it would help if we could seek consensus for the best wording on all the ocean articles ''before'' making changes of the nature you have done to date. (As it is, there is now also a fair bit of rewording necessary in the changes you've made to the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Ocean articles.) --'''\nSatuSuro: ''and also the use by other bodies such as the CIA World Fact Book'' - see also [[Australia_and_the_Southern_Ocean]] - I can see you are both an established user and admin - but I fail to see why you should refer to the CIA World Fact book as an example of a usage of a term - perhaps I am indeed missing something - I thought it had been established years ago on wikipedia that it is ''not a reliable source'' - specially of usage of terms and ''so called facts'' - and to use it as a reason for reverting something you dont agree with in an edit summary?  Perhaps you might explain further?  We have had some very weird arguments about the ocean south of Australia as being the Indian Ocean despite Australian geographic names authorities saying otherwise - I am not convinced that you have the issue solved in your reversions or comments so far - perhaps I have missed something by  having had the southern ocean off my watch list for almost a year \nSatuSuro: ''active concept in use by the IHO and other world bodies'' - could you please provide a diff or source for that - please not the southern ocean talk page standard of ''i read it in britannica'', ''my school teacher'', ''my atlas'' - thanks \nCkatz: Where was it stated that the CIA publication isn't considered a reliable source? It's certainly in widespread use as a reference source in many articles across the project, and I can't see any discussions at [[Wikipedia:Reliable_sources\\/Noticeboard|the WP:RS noticeboard]] that conclude it is unreliable. (The topic has certainly been brought up, for example [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources\\/Noticeboard\\/Archive 18#The CIA taken as an Authority|here]], [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources\\/Noticeboard\\/Archive 3#CIA - The World Factbook|here]] and [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources\\/Noticeboard\\/Archive 9#CIA World Factbook and US Department of State|here]], but the consensus is that the book ''is'' an acceptable source.) --'''\nBazonka: Your comments and thoughts please. \nCkatz: I agree that the resolution of this lies in finding a way to present all aspects of the matter. With regard to the IHO, I'd disagree that that text should be completely removed from the lead. We have to consider the fact that they are the defining body for these matters. We certainly need to present conflicting viewpoints, but we also cannot merely lump them in as \\\"just another viewpoint\\\". (This is similar to Pluto's recent re-categorization as a dwarf planet; while we present alternative views, the definition from the defining body - the IAU - is regarded as the scientific standard.) I think you've put forward some good ideas, though, and will try to respond to them in more detail later today. --'''\nCkatz: --'''\nBazonka: OK then, I think the reference to IHO in the intro should be something like: \\\"The [[International Hydrographic Organization]] (IHO) has variously defined the Southern Ocean as being non-existent, or being south of [[60th parallel south|60\\xb0S]]; the former being the IHO's official position, the latter being the most commonly used (see below)\\\".  Despite your latest edit and reference, you cannot just say that they have \\\"designated the Southern Ocean as an oceanic division encircling Antarctica\\\" - this is POV. \nSatuSuro: Reply - there have been as many threads in the past (prehaps earlier on in the project) that have shown gross inaccuracies such as the article cited above \nCkatz: Sorry, but what?!? How exactly is it POV? They originally defined the Southern Ocean in the 2nd edition, removed it for various reasons in the 3rd, then voted (and passed) a motion to restore it in 2000. They have announced their intention to publish it in the upcoming 4th edition, and it is in use by them and by other reliable sources. Your rewrite strongly suggests the IHO does ''not'' officially endorse their own plans, which is not an accurate depiction of what is going on at all. While the 3rd edition is still active ''pending the introduction of the 4th'', the IHO has '''clearly''' demonstrated their intention to move forward with the reintroduction of the term, and other reputable international bodies have acknowledged this and are proceeding in a similar manner. Our wording must reflect this reality, not obscure it. --'''\nBazonka: It's POV because you are presenting the 2000 definition as a done deal - it isn't. And it's clear that the IHO wants that to be their official definition - but it's not. The intro must succinctly reflect this, showing both sides of the story. Perhaps the following wording is better: \\\"The [[International Hydrographic Organization]] (IHO) officially does not recognize the existence of the Southern Ocean, but has agreed on an as-yet unratified definition of the ocean as being south of [[60th parallel south|60\\xb0S]]; this definition is widely used by the IHO and others.\\\" \nSatuSuro: Whatever you folks come up with there is and will a steady steam of news stories running like this http:\\/\\/www.abc.net.au\\/news\\/stories\\/2010\\/01\\/06\\/2786732.htm?section=justin - I am very sure that the average journalist is '''not''' going to stick to any arbitrary 60 degree story whatever you two might sort out - most journalists are inherently geographically challenged and lazy - and because of that alone - a lack of both sides of the story - will be to the detriment of wikipedia as the curious will see the sea shepherd story and - if they are not careful they are going to find a wikipedia article that tells them that whales and lives are at risk in an ocean that does not exist!  Take care \nBazonka: Well, I have been bold and made the amendments as discussed above. Hopefully they are acceptable to all, but if not, then please discuss. Thanks. \nCkatz: I've restored the previous version for now. (Apologies for being away from this for a few days.) While this discussion is moving along, the text is still not ready for implementation. Your version still has issues in that it strongly suggests the IHO doesn't support its own concept, which is not the case. Realistically, we need to research the status better; we know the Southern Ocean definition has passed a vote, and we know the 4th edition publication hasn't been ratified. The question is whether the lack of publication changes the status of the vote; does the IHO consider the Southern Ocean to be official at this time. Again, we need to hash this out - probably on the SO talk page for greater input - and then have an RfC to get more opinions (given that this has ramifications beyond just the one article.) --'''\nBazonka: I've had one more go at reworking the text. If you're still not happy then we'll take it to a wider debate. But I'm reasonably confident that you won't object too much to this one - I've removed all reference to \\\"official\\\" and \\\"unofficial\\\" definitions, instead referring to \\\"latest published\\\" and \\\"more recent\\\" definitions.  \nFranamax: Drive-by comment: I like the most recent version as it expresses the ambiguity well.

IHO 3rd edition doesn't group water bodies as part of other bodies, but apparently the unratified IHO 4th edition does, or will do. CIA World Factbook apparently is using the 4th ed. definitions but we generally end up using 3rd ed. because we're absolutely sure of its status. The same situation applies here, latest-but-unratified or known-but-out-of-date? The difference is that \\\"Southern Ocean\\\" is a term in undoubted broad use, we're just not exactly sure what the heck it precisely means. \nBazonka: Thanks Franamax. I've just updated the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Ocean articles using similar wording. Also hopefully acceptable.
