    "4": "Blackbox77: Do you consider the MLS Timbers to be one-in-the-same as the NASL and USL Timbers? Or just different teams using the same name and respecting the name's history? --\nDemonJuice: A bit of both. The USL and MLS teams are certainly the same. Same website, same owners, same stadium, etc. In fact, the official roster for the MLS club is now at the exact same link the official roster for the USL club was at. The NASL and WSL\\/APSL teams were certainly different entities but the club operates as if they were not as evidenced by the USL club retiring the number of a NASL player and continuing that on with the MLS club. \nBlackbox77: I think it might end up having to be an either\\/or situation. Either we are going to say that yes, the NASL and MLS are the exact same club, or we believe they are two different clubs with the newer symbolically carrying the torch of the older. In my opinion, the fact that the MLS Timbers are honoring retired NASL numbers and associating themselves with the history of the name doesn't make them one-in-the-same with the original club. When the NASL Timbers folded, it was a definitive end to an organization. Now that MLS Timbers have chosen to pick up the name doesn't instantly mean the very same club has sprung back to life. Otherwise we'd just give them the same article, right? Now there might be an argument for the USL Timbers and MLS Timbers being one-in-the-same but that's probably a discussion for another time. I think most people\\u2013including Merritt Paulson and MLS in general\\u2013view the MLS Timbers as a brand new entity. Something that has never existed before...just with a name that has. They come across as being all the same in name only. --\nDemonJuice: I understand your argument and it has merit. Whatever the consensus turns out to be, I'll comply with it. There's a push to merge the Whitecaps articles and the arguments would be very similar for the Timbers. I'm not married to the template as is and I agree it is divergent from other MLS navboxes. Then again, the Timbers are a somewhat unique situation and what happens elsewhere on Wikipedia has never been a valid sole defense for what happens in a particular article. If we're going to get technical, how come the Earthquakes template lists honors and seasons that should really be attributed to the Dynamo? Again, that argument means nothing towards the Timbers template. Let's discuss it.

Sorry to bother you again, but Asgardian seem to be having an edit conflict again, as seen [http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/w\\/index.php?title=Red_Hulk&action=history here]. I tried leaving [http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/w\\/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAsgardian&diff=310561997&oldid=310363854 a message on his Talk Page] explaining my rationale, and suggesting that we start a consensus discussion. Instead of agree to that, or even responding to my message at all, he went and [http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/w\\/index.php?title=Red_Hulk&diff=310867991&oldid=310835371 reverted the article again], which is against WP policy regarding edit conflicts. I've started a consensus discussion on the conflict on Red Hulk [http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Talk:Red_Hulk#Publication_history here]. I request that you monitor the situation so that if he continues to revert without discussion (the offense for which he was blocked previously), you can offer your assistance. Thanks. \nMangojuice: I am not really active enough to take on new things to monitor closely such as this.  I took a look at the recent behavior and it appears that discussion is underway and reverting has slowed down or stopped, so I see no need for a block right now.  I suggest if you feel a block is merited at some point, that's when it's best to request help.  And [[WP:ANI]] is probably better than requesting my help directly, because I'm not all that active these days.  \nNightscream: See, this is why blocking him outright sometimes appears to be the only option: Every time I try asking people to participate, they come up with some excuse not to. You asked me to contact you, and I did, and now you're finding a reason not to. Yeah, a discussion was underway, and guess what? Four people (I and three others) came to a consensus on three of the four points I brought up (six if you count two others in a discussion on the Comics Project in February--It's in the portion of [http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Comics\\/Archive_38#Stand_up_and_take_notice.21 this discussion beginning on 2.13.09]) and what did Asgardian do? He reverted the article. When confronted, he stated that there was \\\"no clear consensus\\\" on the matter. He even reverted ''blindly'', and in knee-jerk fashion, because he not only changed the disputed content, but even a valid edit in which I [http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/w\\/index.php?title=Talk%3ARed_Hulk&diff=311406305&oldid=311403436 formatted two mentions of the same source with the ref name tag]. He also appears to have [http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/w\\/index.php?title=Talk:Red_Hulk&diff=next&oldid=311417923 edited my post on the article's Talk Page to delink my signature] for some reason, and others in the discussion appear to be losing their patience with him, as seen in [http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/User_talk:J_Greb#I.27m_not_saying_I_told_you_so... this other page].
