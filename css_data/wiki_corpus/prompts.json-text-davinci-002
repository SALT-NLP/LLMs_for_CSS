What\\u2019s wrong with pop as a category? It\\u2019s a perfectly accurate description of The Beatles\\u2019 music circa 1963. --\nPL290: Well, it was discussed, as you say, but surely \\\"rock band\\\" then stuck for a good while as the preferred modern-day parlance? That's why I too took out \\\"pop and rock band\\\" the other day&mdash;I was surprised to see it while considering those other proposed changes to the opening sentence. Sure, they played pop and rock, but if you ask me, rock band describes them perfectly. Rock bands play pop too. \nPatthedog: It might seem only little thing (funnily, I was saying that to Mrs. Patthedog the other day) but it\\u2019s important to me. However, I\\u2019m sure that I\\u2019ll get over it in time. That\\u2019s the way democracy crumbles.

    "2": "Amakuru: I'm curious because the two dates you mention do not appear the same when I look at them, they just appear exactly as coded in the wikitext. Similarly 2010-09-29 appears exactly as coded. I have always wondered what the best way to format a date is and I am still none the wiser! Thanks &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;\nBanyanTree: However, per [[Wikipedia:Date formatting and linking poll#The history of the dispute]], in 2008 linking dates was deprecated, which means they cannot be autoformatted.  ([[MOS:UNLINKDATES]]) As there's no clear guidance on what format is preferred, this leads to the slow motion edit wars on dates you see everywhere.  The wiki is a silly place.

    "3": "Tim riley: Thanks for your tip. I was asked to provide a reference for the sentence in question but couldn't, but I shall bear in mind your sage advice. \nSsilvers: Hello.  Just because Lebrecht said it, that doesn't make it true.  Lebrecht gives no source or basis for this opinion.  It appears, from all the other references, that Lebrecht's opinion is dubious - rumour at best and possibly a spiteful lie.  I don't think this source qualifies as a [[WP:RS]].  -- \nGrover cleveland: If you disagree with Lebrecht's criticism, I suggest that you add other citations that contradict Lebrecht -- right now I don't see any.  I suggest that we put further messages on this subject at [[Talk:Malcolm Sargent]] -- I'll be checking there for any replies.

    "5": "Jance: icles about every other profession, where there is any local media attention, and see how long Wikipedians think that is okay.\nJance: The medical journal is of a medical association, which is a lobbying group for doctors. That is not unexpected. And a law professor is surely the right person to be discussing law topics. Neither of those examples prove noteworthiness.  I surely don't doubt that Shapiro is \\\"over-zealous\\\". I would say downright sleazy. But that does not merit an encyclopedia article, and the verocity with which WAS defended (and even tried to create multiple like articles) shows how NON-NPOV the purpose was.   I did start an article on a medical doctor that was written up in the Washington Post.  WAPO is far more likely to be noteworthy than are the examples you cited.  Yet I find it interesting that Tyrenius implied that somehow WAPO was less a \\\"yardstick\\\" for noteworthiness than a medical lobbying group in an article on doctors, or a law professor\\/lawschool in an article on a lawyer.  Somehow that just boggles the mind. \n\nBased on the conversation is Jance in a position of power? \n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either True or False with without using any other words.",
