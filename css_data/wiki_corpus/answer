62	False	It appears that this conversation took place on a talk page or discussion board on Wikipedia. FkpCascais and Direktor seem to be discussing the coverage of the Chetniks, a movement in the Balkans during World War II. FkpCascais appears to be concerned that Direktor is pushing a biased viewpoint of the Chetniks as a positive force, while ignoring their negative actions. Direktor denies this accusation and claims to have a balanced view of the movement. The conversation also touches on the issue of neutrality in editing Wikipedia articles.

72	False	It seems that there is a conversation about a failed request for adminship (RfA) on Wikipedia, with several users offering their opinions and advice. Pedro is offering some encouragement, stating that it's important to remember that most people are honestly assessing the candidate and not opposing for malicious reasons. Pedro also suggests that the candidate may benefit from gaining more experience in article building. NHRHS2010 expresses feeling hurt by an opposing user, Lucid, who criticized their English proficiency. Pedro acknowledges that English proficiency is important, but not the only factor in RfA, and notes that Lucid is a respected Wikipedian who would not oppose lightly. Phoenix15 adds that Lucid has been more critical since changing their username, but is still a great editor. Hdt83 offers sympathy and suggests that the candidate get involved in other parts of Wikipedia to gain support for a future RfA. Finally, Lucid responds to the criticism, stating that while English proficiency isn't terribly important, it did give them concerns about the candidate's ability to communicate with other editors, and advises the candidate not to take the outcome of their RfA too personally.

Utahredrock has responded by acknowledging their mistakes and expressing their willingness to listen to Tvoz's advice, while also maintaining their right to mention Tvoz's name in relevant discussions. They have also agreed to refrain from commenting on Tvoz's talk page unless given permission to do so.

483	True	The conversation appears to be a discussion on how to present information about the Southern Ocean on Wikipedia. Bazonka edited the Southern Ocean article, explaining that the fourth edition of the IHO's Limits of Oceans and Seas was never ratified or published, and that the article should reflect this neutral point of view. Ckatz reverted the edit, stating that the Southern Ocean is an active concept in use by the IHO and other world bodies. SatuSuro raised concerns about the reliability of the CIA World Factbook as a source and requested a source for Ckatz's statement. The discussion continues with Ckatz asserting that the IHO has defined the Southern Ocean in various ways and announced their intention to publish it in the upcoming fourth edition. Bazonka proposed a new wording for the introduction to reflect the IHO's varying positions on the Southern Ocean.

157	True	This conversation appears to be an exchange between two editors on Wikipedia who are having a disagreement. Fly by Night appears to have made multiple nominations for deletion of a page and has been called out by Uncle G for not doing any work themselves to improve the page. Fly by Night feels that Uncle G's comments are aggressive and unacceptable, and has requested an apology. However, Uncle G is continuing to argue that Fly by Night is not taking any action to improve the page and is abusing the deletion process. The conversation continues with both editors defending their positions.

160	False	It seems that there is some disagreement and tension between the editors involved in the article review process. Moni3 is disappointed with the GA review process and feels that Mattisse's behavior was unacceptable. Mattisse defends her opinions and actions but asks Moni3 to stop posting disparaging remarks. Malleus_Fatuorum suggests that the original review process was flawed and agrees that the article could be improved with further review. Dave souza advises against using aggressive and uncivil language and suggests that a more patient and respectful approach may be more productive. Ling.Nut offers to help Moni3 with sources and believes that their contributions are above reproach. Overall, there seems to be a lack of agreement and understanding, but some editors are willing to help improve the article.
161	True	True.
162	False	This is a dialogue between two editors on Wikipedia regarding the neutrality of an article about an individual. Volunteer Marek is asking for a neutrality tag to be restored to the article, while Cerejota is arguing that there is no neutrality issue present, but rather a verifiability issue. Volunteer Marek claims that the sources used in the article do not call the individual a "Zionist," but rather say that the individual's manifesto has some "Zionist" content in it. Cerejota disagrees and states that the sources used in the article are reliable and verifiable. The discussion continues with other editors joining in and proposing solutions such as peer-reviewing the quotations before inclusion and including an edit notice to warn editors of using primary sources in a manner not permitted by policy.

367	False	This conversation seems to be about a dispute over the deletion of two images related to Pink Floyd and Syd Barrett on Wikipedia. The Parrot of Doom is questioning why the images were deleted and arguing that they cannot be easily replaced with other free images. Meanwhile, Rama is arguing that the images do not meet the criteria for fair use and that they should only be used sparingly for critical discussion. Elen of the Roads suggests that the images should go through a deletion discussion. Xeno indicates that the images were deleted out-of-process but restored. The discussion touches on issues such as the significance of the images, fair use policy, and the availability of free images.

106	True	It seems like you are looking at a conversation between two editors on Wikipedia about the page for "grass." One editor, BD2412, is arguing that the dominant meaning of "grass" is the plant commonly referred to as such and that the disambiguation page is unnecessary. They believe that the page should lead users directly to the article on grass. The other editor, Marshman, disagrees and argues that the purpose of disambiguation pages is to avoid disputes and that by ignoring the other potential meanings of "grass," BD2412 is setting a troublesome precedent. Marshman also argues that disambiguation pages serve as a release valve for different users' perspectives and that BD2412's changes could be creating more difficulty than they solve.
