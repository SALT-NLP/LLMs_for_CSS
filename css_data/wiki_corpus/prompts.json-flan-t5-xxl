    "0": "173.60.201.35: My post on [[Presidency_of_Barack_Obama|Presidency of Barack Obama]] is not vandalism. The awarding to him of the Nobel Peace Prize is highly controversial, so I mentioned that fact in the article. I put a reference to a reputable website (http:\\/\\/online.wsj.com\\/article\\/SB125509603349176083.html), so this information is obviously true. Stating true information is not vandalism.[[Special:Contributions\\/173.60.201.35|173.60.201.35]] (\nBigtimepeace: That's not what I was reverting, rather I was reverting [http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/w\\/index.php?title=Presidency_of_Barack_Obama&diff=prev&oldid=330606588 this] edit were you made reference to \\\"Communistic intentions\\\" (whatever that means). Your previous edit was reverted in the process, and while not vandalism it was highly [[WP:NPOV|POV]]. Obviously don't add the \\\"communistic intentions\\\" garbage back in, and if you want to talk about the controversy over the Nobel Peace Prize discuss it on the talk page first. I would have no problem with a section on the awarding of the prize including the controversy, but we can't describe it in a POV fashion in the lead, so I'll again be reverting you in a moment. --\n173.60.201.35: You reverted my edit saying the awarding of the Nobel Prize was controversial, so don't say you didn't. Go look at the page history. It is neutral point of view to say it was controversial, because it is controversial. Simply stating the facts is neutral. Go look at [[WP:NPOV|POV]]. It says \\\"All Wikipedia articles and other encyclopedic content must be written from a neutral point of view, representing fairly, and as far as possible without bias, '''''all significant views''''' that have been published by reliable sources.\\\" There is a major point of view that he shouldn't have received the award, so it is very controversial. I referenced a major, reputable website (http:\\/\\/online.wsj.com\\/article\\/SB125509603349176083.html). In the edit summary you said \\\"Reverted 2 edits by 173.60.201.35 identified as vandalism to last revision by DD2K. using TW\\\". Don't say it is vandalism if it isn't.[[Special:Contributions\\/173.60.201.35|173.60.201.35]] (\nBigtimepeace: Again, I fully agree that we can discuss the Nobel as being controversial, but we need to do so in the body of the article, not in the lead. There are many adjectives that could be applied to Obama's Nobel Peace Prize (\\\"deserved,\\\" \\\"surprising\\\", \\\"controversial,\\\" \\\"undeserved,\\\" etc.) and many sources which could be found to back up those adjectives. We do not pick one of those at random and stick that in the lead. Please continue this conversation on the article talk page since that is where it belongs, and at least own up to the \\\"communist intentions\\\" edit you made which was clearly ridiculous and not in good faith, and is the whole reason you were reverted by me, even if another edit got caught up in it. --\n173.60.201.35: Controversial is the most descriptive word, and is accurate. If I instead said \\\"deserved\\\" or \\\"undeserved\\\", it would not be neutral because it represents only one group of people. By saying \\\"controversial\\\", I simply say that there are many disagreements on the subject. Stating it is controversial doesn't support or object to the awarding of the Nobel Prize, it simply states that there are vast disagreements on the subject. There is no reason why it shouldn't be mentioned where it states he received the prize. It isn't taking a up a lot of space, and it isn't making the introduction significantly longer. It is one word that makes the sentence much more descriptive. As for the communistic intentions, it is not vandalism. Before the election, he said \\\"I think when you spread the wealth around, it\\u2019s good for everybody.\\\" Redistribution of wealth is communism. That quote proves Obama supports redistribution of wealth. Therefore he must be a communist.[[Special:Contributions\\/173.60.201.35|173.60.201.35]] (\nBigtimepeace: And as I already said, take the conversation about the word \\\"controversial\\\" to the article talk page.

What it seems to be referring to, though, is a phenomenon I've often watched in disputes where an editor assumes ''good faith'' of one party by imputing ''bad faith'' to the other.  If editors want to live by the spirit of [[WP:AGF]] then what they really ought to be doing is making their best effort to assume positive motivations of the people who aren't already in agreement with them.  Sometimes disagreements are a matter of priorities or perspective.  Does it make more sense to think of it that way? <font face=\\\"Verdana\\\">\nCimon Avaro: I do find it kind of amusing to see you think you can claim to be among the audience, after so vociferously claiming affiliation with the people pulling the strings amongst the backstage workings. -- \nCimon Avaro: Just to be crystal clear where I stand. When *I* approached Jimbo Wales to the effect of asking him to remove editing priviledges from someone, that *someone* was not a new editor much later arrived than myself, but a much more senior editor, in far better standing than myself (and he still continues to edit, to my great pleasure), and furthermore, in asking Jimbo to consider whether that editor should be barred from editing wikipedia, I made a specific stipulation that should Jimbo feel it useful, each and every word I used in the e-mail, was his to use as he saw fit, attributed to me, claimed as his own or whatever. None of it I claimed private or priviledged communication. This I think very much illustrates a highly divergent perspective from one you seem to have been blessed with. I hope you see where I am coming from. -- \nDurova: I'm afraid that's not very clear at all.  I never used IRC, not on any channel.  I did join a list called cyberstalking because - well - the name should be obvious.  I wouldn't wish that on anyone.  A lot of things have been said about me and attributed to me that I never actually said or did; it's like looking at a caricature of myself to read it.

I won't enter into shadow boxing matches, but I will not in anyway let anyone think that your and my situation are comparable.

If you want to have them at some other name, I suggest a WP:RM block move proposal.  --\nDoncram: Thanks for pointing to that Category of neighborhoods in Connecticut.  They are not consistent, but which way to go is not clear from just looking at current state there.  The trend has been towards \\\", Connecticut\\\" naming, in moves i have seen by other editors in Connecticut.

At least CT seems to have it's own convention for naming neighborhoods, and the conventions also seem to differ for various cities.  --\nDoncram: There is no \\\"convention\\\" for CT neighborhood names;  there was just Born2cycle discerning a pattern, while others would discern a different pattern or, with view over time, a trend in fact opposite to pattern Born2cycle discerned.  There are a lot of neighborhood names created by one editor who has occasionally disavowed any rhyme or reason in what he did, when questioned.  There are occasional moves of some of them.  All embroiled in other issues, such as whether to force mergers with articles not about the neighborhoods.

Notice how French building pictures [[:File:Tour-Total.jpg]] and [[:File:Areva1.jpg]] are at Wikipedia, not Commons, under an ''unfree'' fair use license.

The same applies to the scanned images. \nwknight94: That is all irrelevant in multiple ways.  First, your photograph is of a ''three''-dimensional building.  Second, the original art objects (paintings, photographs, book illustrations) are still ''themselves'' copyrighted, so any reproduction of them could be violating the original artist's copyright.

If you want to draw on it as a source for other edits in the article, please feel free. But you are actually doing more harm to the article than you are good at the moment, and if you are not willing to do the work to add the relevant content and make it work with the article, then you should not expect that others are eager to do it either. --\nFastfission: Of the two images listed below, one ''clearly'' has an incorrect copyright tag and the other one, from what I could tell, had no evidence of being tagged correctly either. Do not lecture me on not deleting things without looking them up first -- I did check on both images and found their copyright information to be incorrect. ''You'' are the one who should be checking up on them more thoroughly if you don't want them deleted. It is not ''my'' job to make sure that ''you'' do not post copyright violations. If you do not understand our image policy, please let me know, and I can direct you to pages which explain it. I spend 90% of my time on Wikipedia adding article content and free images, and only about 10% cleaning up after people who do things in disregard to article content or copyrights, so I don't need you lecturing me on that, either. --\nFastfission: And speaking of which, please '''stop''' posting blatant copyright violations, such as at [[STED microscopy]]. --\nFastfission: It's not my job, because '''you''' are the one who is supposed to be following the policies. If you add more blatantly copyrighted images or text to Wikipedia, you will get '''blocked'''. We take copyrights '''very''' seriously around here, and if you cannot learn our policies then you cannot be an editor here. It is really pretty simple -- the bottom of the editor window says pretty clearly that \\\"content must not violate any copyright.\\\" Wikipedia is indeed comprehensive, and can only stay that way based on the hard work of people who make new content. If we violate copyright we will get legally in trouble and then there will be no more Wikipedia. So please try to respect this aspect of things. --\nGeorgewilliamherbert: Slicky, I have to agree with Fastfission here; what you're doing here is blatantly against WP policy, and if you keep it up you're going to get yourself in trouble.  You can't just lift large sections of other peoples work and include it without proper credit.  GFDL or government works origin doesn't mean we can get away with grabbing without attribution.  Please knock it off.  Thank you.  \nSlicky: It's not that i absolutely resent his ideas. But from my POV it is favourable to have at least a stub even if blatantly copy-pasted (as long as it is only an excerpt) for as long as someone else finally has the time, and in most cases it is me anyways, to write the article in his own terms with further research. e.g. [[STED microscope]] is now fixed. So gimme a break. Each and everyone here is entitled to his own opinion, and although you are right in principle, there is now way someone would ever make a law suit for a small excerpt that is equipped with the according link, along with the fact that wikipedia is non-profit etc. Proof me wrong and show me a precedence-case, if not i'll stick to it, in good hope that more people get to more information faster, which is all i am interested in, as i expect the same from wikipedia. \nChristopher Thomas: I'm afraid you're going to have to take the five minutes to write at least a single-sentence stub on your own. Cut-and-pasted material is 1) against policy, 2) usually illegal, and 3) something that will get an article deleted on sight. GWH is correct in noting that you're going to get banned if you keep doing this. --\nSlicky: Okay, in a way a self-formulated stub one-liner along with relevant links does a way better job at satisfying one's ego anyways ;)\nSlicky: That i do not even dispute and as far as that goes we are on the same page, although any rational person can infer that. However in the long run the article SHOULD get ammended, and as there is no such thing as a work-pool for intermediary content i am convinced this is the best way. Just look at the quality of most new articles and how well researched and objective they are in about a year. However you are doing even more harm by not trying to be more constructive. e.g. the licencing. You're already on the page and it would demand 10 more key presses but instead you favor the way to induce long lasting discussions etc. Should i always contribute A-style content over vital quantity...... well here's an idea: teamplay-each his own. \n\nBased on the conversation is Fastfission in a position of power? \n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either True or False with without using any other words.",

Finally, if there is anything that I can assist you with - please don't hesitate to ask. Cheers \nSplash: ''Please'' don't call it that. I unprotect what others forget to is all. (Plus the occasional difference of opinion.) Interesting data, though. -\nTawker: What would you say to an expiry option on the protect button, similar to the block expiry? -- \nSplash: Perhaps. I talked about this with FoN a while back. I can certainly see the sense, since admins are very forgetful (and then get upset when I remember for them...). But I rather fear we'd finish up with a similar situation to what happens when someone shortens a block. We'd also likely legitimise the \\\"indefinite\\\" option which is something I am deeply uncomfortable with. I know that all protections are indefinite at the moment, but not in the same way as having a menu option for it. -\nTawker: I think the issue with having to keep the infinite button around is some pages have to be fully protected all of the time.  Imagine if we unprotected the front page or the [[WP:AWB|AWB]] checkpage.  All that being said, protection is a necessary evil sometimes, something best avoided. I don't know about people complaining about shortening of an protection, the protection really is a stop gap measure (that can possibly stop a lot of godo faith editors from editing) whereas the block restricts (hopefully) one person.  It's food for thought, if I have time I might draft up a proposal for it.  On a second note, if you have itme could you take a look at [[User:Tawkerbot2\\/FAQ]] - its an FAQ page for the bot that hopefully explains what it does in a newbie friendly way, I don't know how it reads from someone who doesn't know its inner workings, and I'm a little concerned it might be too \\\"geek speekish\\\". Cheers -- \nSplash: Those examples are true; I hadn't considered those. Actually, I think people would take the appearance of the option as sanction for the ''use'' of the option, when even on [[George W. Bush]] there is at best an uneasy truce regarding this rather than any consensus supporting it. If you decide to make a proposal, taking it to [[WT:SEMI]] would be the place to start, I guess. Or maybe [[WP:PPol]]. I copyedited the FAQ. I think it's good. -\nBD2412: Here's a thought - how about a button that allows a maximum protection time of seven days for things in the article space. That way, continued protection after the expiry would at least have to be someone's conscious act. \nCan't sleep, clown will eat me: It would be nice if there was an optional protection expiration date, similar to how administrators are able to block for a definite amount of time (15 minutes, 24 hours, permanently, et cetera).  Are the developers able to implement this?  \nTawker: With respect to the hard limit on protection, the only disadvantage I see to this is the deleted pages that we protect to prevent re-creation, maybe an override for 'bcrats and ArbCom \\/ Stewards \\/ Jimbo might be necessary. I was just on the tech channel and Rob Church says there's a bug report for it somewhere (and being stupid and not finding the right keyword, I haven't found the URL yet) but it looks like it might be dooable (though probally on the list of bugs to fix its faster 550 or so) -- \nSplash: I like the idea of having to consciously renew protection in article space. Tawker's problems remain, though and I'm not sure that handing it to bureaucrats is necessarily desirable given their marginal activity levels, but they'd have very few pages per day\\/week to actually handle and they'd not be critical immediately. Perhaps a function to mark as a {deletedarticle} is the way to handle it, though we're left with [[Main Page]] and the other mission-critical pages to deal with. So maybe, as cscwem suggests, just port the blocking interface to the protection interface; presumably the additional code is small. I'd like to see \\\"indefinite\\\" suppressed from that list, though. Or maybe we'd have to SHOUT about a new convention: in the same way we don't indef-block IPs even though we could, we don't indef-protect articles. I'm thinking out loud here, really. -\n{unknown-5202}: Or it could be easier to create a dynamically-generated Special: page, like [[Special:Longprotected]], that would list all the pages that have been left protected for, let's say, 30 days or more. The problem with the current category scheme is that you can't figure out which pages were protected ten minutes ago and which ones are permanently protected. \nKelly Martin: It would be relatively easy to write a query on the toolserver for that purpose. \nSplash: Oh, that'd be great. Something like the PROD listing, maybe. It'd making cleaning [[CAT:SEMI]] much less painful and time-consuming than it is at the moment. I guess, if that can't be done by some willing toolserverite, that we could use the auto-dating that the {{tl|nsd}} uses, although it would mean substing the template into article space which is suboptimal. -\nBD2412: '''''GENIUS''''' - a prod for seeing articles that have been semi'd too long (though I'd make them show up before 30 days). \n{unknown-5203}: I'm not sure running it on the toolserver is a good idea, as we're killing it... it has a 1.5 day lag already.

I've started a consensus discussion on the conflict on Red Hulk [http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Talk:Red_Hulk#Publication_history here].

He reverted the article. When confronted, he stated that there was \\\"no clear consensus\\\" on the matter.

    "68": "Fæ: Picking up on Epeefleche's recent comments, the original discussion in February ([[User talk:F\\xe6\\/2011#speedy vs too speedy|here]]) and knowing that you have strong opinions on this topic, I was wondering what the best practice was to help someone improve their practical interpretation of the CSD guidelines. I could, say, easily forswear any use of A1\\/A3 for six months while I think about it, however it can also be argued that if I am to improve my practical interpretation then it would be a good idea to show my use of these CSD categories appropriately. Is there an existing consensus about the best approach to improvement? Thanks \nWereSpielChequers: Hi F\\xe6,I don't think it would be a good idea to forswear use of a particular CSD category as they all have their value. But a promise never to tag A1 or A3 in the first ten minutes might be helpful. I'm very cautious both with CSD tagging and deletion, I suspect I'm rather more cautious than the majority of the community. Mostly I use CSD to deal with bad faith edits, author requests for deletion and articles that effectively assert non-notability. I decline a sizable minority of tags that are incorrect, and there are loads of quite legitimate A7 tags that I leave because in my view speedy shouldn't mean instant when it comes to goodfaith articles. There are a whole set of essays and at least one survey on my userpage. You might also look at [[wp:NEWT]] when a bunch of us created alt accounts that then submitted articles, we had enough not deleted to rebut the original press criticism that any new article was guaranteed to be deleted. But a lot were tagged, so it did yield an interesting list of incorrect tags. ''\nFæ: Thanks, when things are quieter I'll take time to ponder the essays and absorb them properly. In the meantime I'll think about adding a commitment about it to my talk page (though I don't plan say anything about commitments in my RFA as I probably should be judged on my edit history rather than promises about the future). Cheers \nWereSpielChequers: I think that commitments can play a part in RFA. In my first RFA I shifted my settings from a default to minor edits to the reverse, other people have amended signatures and created alt accounts. A promise not to tag A1 and A3 articles in their first ten minutes is in my mind a credible RFA commitment - we had another candidate recently who had been tagging G10s as A7s and that wasn't something you could fix that quickly - they'd have needed a b period of editing where they'd demonstrated better tagging. ''\nFæ: I have made a commitment on my talk page, let me know if you spot any wording improvements that could be made. If asked another question I'll bring it up but otherwise I'll just point to it in discussion away from RFA. I would hope that if this is considered a good thing, then it will be mentioned by someone else spontaneously anyway.

In the unblock discussion I had with him, I did state he could report possible Merkey socks to the appropriate noticeboards. If I remember, he was going through old edits by possible socks and reverting them needlessly, which was the problematic behavior. I'm not sure what I should do here. He's not violating the letter of the unblock, but perhaps the spirit. Looking through his report, he's likely right. Those were Jeff Merkey socks. Is reporting socks disruptive in and of itself disruptive. I'd say no. The action of going through every old article that Jeff Merkey ever edited was the disruptive action. If you'd like a total interaction ban between the two including reports, I think that needs community consensus. I wouldn't oppose, though. <font face=\\\"Herculanum\\\" color=\\\"black\\\">\nSlimVirgin: Since then he has made nine edits to articles and talk, and 14 edits related to Merkey.

That should give you pause. I agreed to your unblock on the understanding that you'd be editing in general, and not about Merkey. You've violated that, and so I hope Animate reinstates it. <font color=\\\"blue\\\">\nAniMate: IMO, the only reason this latest round of Merkey related editing occurred is because Merkey, or someone with an IP in his area, added tags to accounts accusing them of being Pfagerburg's socks. If he had gone after Merkey's edits apropos of nothing, yes I would block. However, responding to sock allegations isn't unreasonable. I'm not going to reblock. <font face=\\\"Herculanum\\\" color=\\\"black\\\">\nSlimVirgin: Pfagerburg said above that he started the latest round when he tagged what he thought was a Merkey sock on September 7, then the next day posted to have an article deleted that he thought Merkey wrote. [http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/w\\/index.php?title=Special:Undelete&target=MDB+%28Linux%29&timestamp=20100908022130&diff=prev] That's not what people do if they don't want to have anything to do with someone. Animate, this issue was settled. He had been indefinitely blocked and was unblocked ''on the understanding that he was here to edit Wikipedia''. He hasn't done that. What is the point of laying down conditions then ignoring them? The Pfagerburg account is one that has been used almost exclusively in pursuit of a named person for almost four years. I don't understand why any admin would feel that was an appropriate use of Wikipedia. <font color=\\\"blue\\\">\nAniMate: The article that set this off was created by the user name PaulFagburg. I see [[Wikipedia:Username_policy#Real_names|impersonation]], [[WP:NPA|homophobic slurs]], and [[WP:SOCK|socking]]. If this is the account that started it, they went after Pfagerburg first. No, I will not block for this, and frankly I don't see why any admin would consider the actions of the user behind PaulFagburg and the various other IPs an acceptable use of Wikipedia. <font face=\\\"Herculanum\\\" color=\\\"black\\\">\nSlimVirgin: You have the chronology confused. That account was created on September 20, ''after'' Pfagerburg had resumed hostilities. And anyway that's missing the point and playing his game; two wrongs don't make a right. The interaction has to end on Wikipedia, no matter who started what. I've asked on AN\\/I for the block to be reinstated.

I did not refer to every type of work you do, obviously, and was simply pointing out that you have done a lot of good work creating more off-beat articles. I'm not familiar with your every contribution, but your user page shows that you like to write on semi-quirky food-related topics and that you do a lot of it&mdash;pointing that out was not meant as a slight or minimization in any way. The flip side to that was that you run into a lot of trouble in political areas, and I think most readers would see that I was contrasting what I see as a problematic editing pattern (relating to politics) with a very constructive one (creating new articles in one topic area). I know you make contributions all over the place and I never said otherwise. I hope that clears it up and I'd like to now consider the matter closed. --\nChildofMidnight: Statements like \\\"ChildofMidnight writes a bunch of articles about strange food items and other off-beat topics and that's great\\\" have been used repeatedly to try to minimize my contributions and to make it look like my only useful contributions are to fringey areas of the encyclopedia. That is grossly inaccurate. I make exceptional contributions across a wide swath of articles including MANY political subjects where editing is often difficult and contentious. If editors were encouraged to focus on article content and sourcing issues, instead of ad hominem attacks we could get a great deal more done. Your statement plays into the character assasinations and pigeon holing. As you haven't amended or clarified it we're not done.

    "108": "MelanieN: Based on this, I believe that significant reviews on publication are sufficient to establish notability in the opinion of most editors, and furthermore that significant reviews on publication are exactly what [[WP:NB]] has in mind when it calls for \\\"multiple, non-trivial published works whose sources are independent of the book itself.\\\" I think your interpretation is novel - not an approach I have ever seen before, or found in a search of past discussions. So if you want to apply it you should probably first look for consensus at [[Wikipedia talk:Notability (books)]]. If you want to start a discussion there, feel free to copy our conversation over there as a start. In any case, thanks for a stimulating discussion! --\nMelanieN: P.S. Another thing that occurs to me: if we adopted your rule that contemporary reviews don't count, it would completely preclude us from covering ANY new books, because we would be required to wait a few years to determine if the book turned out to be notable or not. --\nFT2: Thinking about these would probably help us (as a community) to agree on principles in this area, and clarify [[WP:NB]] for future. \nMelanieN: ## Is \\\"significant publication review coverage\\\" enough by itself to make a book notable? ## Yes, I think it is. And IMO [[WP:NB]] already says that it is. But if you want to clarify that, the relevant talk page would be the appropriate place to try to do it. Please let me know if you do start a discussion there. --\nMelanieN: P.S. What is your response to my comment that according to this criterion you are proposing, recently published books could never (or hardly ever) be listed? Is that what you have in mind, or am I distorting your intention? --\nMelanieN: P.S. Again: the reason I included the past AFD closes is to show that up to now, reviews on publication have been accepted by consensus as evidence of notability. Wikipedia operates by consensus, so if you want to impose this additional requirement, you will have to find others who agree with you, or convince them to agree with you. --\nFT2: As you rightly say, we work on consensus. I honestly don't mind if [[WP:NB]] is amended to say \\\"review coverage alone is sufficient\\\" or is sufficient in some cases (which?), or is usually insufficient. I want to clarify the issues as best we can between us though, and if necessary then get eyeballs and become clearer one way or another how it's viewed by the wider community. \nMelanieN: I don't pretend to know anything about the bands\\/musician criteria here; that's not my thing. But I note that the wording at [[WP:BAND]] is identical to the wording at [[WP:NB]] and so I would assume that mainstream reviews of the band in major sources would qualify it, yes. The same identical wording also applies to [[WP:WEB]]. The fact is that new bands and new websites don't usually get written up in major reliable source publications without good reason. (If a brand new band that has never charted, gets major reviews, it is almost certainly because it IS notable for some reason.) <br> From your \\\"answer-a-question-with-question\\\" response, do I understand you to be confirming that, indeed, newly published books (and websites and musical groups) should not have Wikipedia articles, no matter how many substantial reviews they get? <br> We are talking in circles here. You are trying to apply this new criterion of yours to an increasing number of categories, all of which do seem to currently allow major reviews in mainstream reliable sources as evidence of notability. I accept that as the status quo and I don't think the criteria need to be amended, because I think the admissibility of reviews is clear enough as the guidelines stand.. --\nFT2: My reading of policies and guidelines is to be very wary of \\\"on release\\\" reviews of commercial offerings, which may not show any kind of enduring significance (\\\"Wikipedia is an encyclopedia\\\"). Many users mistake or equate \\\"significant coverage\\\" for \\\"encyclopedic topic\\\", but verifiability, including verified or brief widespread coverage, isn't always going to be the same as encyclopedic significance or notability (as repeatedly noted in discussions). For the sake of future AFDs I'd like to be clearer on the extent to which we take publication or release coverage of commercial or media products as evidence of encyclopedic significance. I feel fairly strongly that we should obtain views and see what consensus is, and my personal view is that publication coverage should be taken very warily if it's the sole evidence. That said, I don't feel hugely strongly on the specific decision such a discussion should reach, my concern is more that we probably should discuss it. Whichever side consensus ends up on is fine preovided it's had careful thought and results in clarity of the area. \nMelanieN: Be my guest. I think you and I understand each other's position pretty well by now and further discussion here would just be repetitious. Will you incorporate our discussion into your proposal to amend the guideline, or start fresh? BTW since you seem to feel the same criteria apply to music and to web pages (and maybe other areas), do you intend to start a discussion on those talk pages too? Because if [[WP:NB]] is amended, all the other pages that have identical wording should be amended as well.  -- \n\nBased on the conversation is FT2 in a position of power? \n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either True or False with without using any other words.",

If you disagree with this, you need to take it up at the appropriate forum. However, we cannot simply revert a banned user's material back in. --'''\nSkomorokh: I in turn am sure you are proceeding in good faith, but you don't know the stupid policy you're misguidedly trying to enforce \\u2013 have [[WP:BAN|a read]] and don't make any further detrimental edits to our articles on its account. I take responsibility for the content. \nCkatz: You can take responsibility for the content, but the link has to stay out. Furthermore, please note that the policy clearly outlines that \\\"bans apply to all editing, good or bad\\\". Also, with respect to \\\"edits by and on behalf of banned editors\\\", note the text that states: ''\\\"Wikipedians in turn are not permitted to post or edit material at the direction of a banned editor (sometimes called proxy editing or proxying) unless they are able to confirm that the changes are verifiable and they have independent reasons for making them\\\"''. You may have your own opinions about Mr. Damian - I can't speak to that - but it does not override the fact that his behaviour has led to a ban from Wikipedia. Quoting from [http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/w\\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard\\/Incidents&oldid=305734197#Peter_Damian the discussion regarding that ban]:<blockquote>''\\\"He's banned, full stop - his accounts are blocked. Any socks are blocked. Any IP addresses or additional accounts linked to him after the ban passes are blocked.\\\"''<\\/blockquote> --'''\nSkomorokh: Peter Damian could not collaborate productively with Wikipedians under our terms \\u2013 something I had significant negative experience of first-hand \\u2013 and was banned as a result. The purpose of this ban, ultimately, was to prevent him from ''making unconstructive contributions''.

    "132": "Kingpin13: You welcome thoughts on this. Mine are that you are jumping up to this much too quickly, and I don't think you really understand the issue yet. We have already discussed mediation\\/closure of this phase, and have Newyorkbrad and WJBScribe lined up to do this (and actually discussed among ourselves about who would do this). We really do not need further mediation here. I would explain further, but as I said, this is going way too fast, and needs to be considered much more carefully. So for now I would appreciate if you put this on hold, rather than offering (although appreciated) to mediate this yourself. I really need some time to collect my thoughts. You may also be interested in [[User_talk:Newyorkbrad#Wikipedia:Pending_changes.2FRequest_for_Comment_February_2011|this discussion]] which Beeblebrox neglected to mention, where we discussed who would close the request (this was also previously discussed at the RfC), and where I, and other opposition, are compared to terrorists, something Beeblebrox apparently has considered in the past, and appears to be what prompted him to open the request. Sorry for the rushed comment, as I say I really need time to collect my thoughts, you guys are moving way too fast. Best, - \nNicholasTurnbull: Thanks for your thoughts, Kingpin13. Please don't worry. I will investigate the dynamics of the RfC fully as this progresses and if it does indeed transpire that no further mediation is necessary (and the requesting parties have specified this), it will be either held or closed as such. However, I should say that the requesting individuals for the Mediation Cabal case are permitted to request the Mediation Cabal to look into mediating it; but please, don't be concerned this means I am instantly assuming a general agreement from RfC participants to have the Mediation Cabal mediate. If there is no consensus for mediation it will, as I said, be closed as such, or else the mediation will be confined to being between the parties that wish to mediate. Nobody is forced to participate in the Mediation Cabal process. --\nKingpin13: Thank you for the cross post, however, I have removed it for now, as I wish to have absolutely nothing to do with this pathetic attempt to circulate the consensus we ''already established'' on the RfC talk page about how we would close this RfC. This request is a display of certain users acting on a whim and completely ignoring what we already discussed and decided on, instead imposing their own personal views on what the object of the RfC is. Obviously I am still rather flustered about this, I suppose I'm not at my best composure after being accused of holding hostages and being likened to a terrorist. I am upset that you plan to plough on with this, as I said I do not think that is the best way forward. Instead it should be put on hold ''until'' you have a clearer understanding of the dynamics of this case, which I do not feel you currently grasp, as evidenced by your approach to this. I appreciate that you feel you should be able to \\\"learn on the job\\\" as it were, but I am of the strong opinion that this will result in conflict with the already agreed upon course. Please ''please please'' place this on hold until you have properly reviewed if it actually needs further mediation (which I assure you it does not, and will simply lead to more harm being done) - \nNicholasTurnbull: I'm sort of between a rock and a hard place with this. The trouble is, the Mediation Cabal doesn't have a rule (unlike the MedCom) that says that all participants must sign agreement to mediation; therefore, I can't just put it on hold based on your objection to the request. The parties who have communicated on the page do have a right to have their case considered by a mediator and discussed. Arguably, also, it is not in fact up to me as a mediator to understand the dynamics of the case; it is up to the parties to discuss it amongst themselves, albeit in a structured (or semi-structured) fashion that produces more driving force than heat. I really do appreciate your concern and for all I know you may be right, but it would be remiss of me to suddenly put what appears to be an urgent request for assistance on hold simply because of your misgivings. If it is apparent that there is no mediation work to be done, or it would be harmful, I will terminate the mediation. --\nNicholasTurnbull: Alright, how about a compromise. I will post on the MedCab page to say that a view has been put forward that consensus has already been reached as per the talk page for the subsequent actions to take on the RfC, and state that until this has been investigated fully the mediation will be kept open, but no direct involvement with the RfC talk page should occur nor any presentation of proposals for action to take on the RfC. --\nKingpin13: That would be very much appreciated, as I say the problem here is that everything is going way too fast. Yes, I agree entirely with your point that they \\\"have a right to have their case considered by a mediator,\\\" however, this particular case is full of controversy, and - no offence to you - an arbitrarily selected user mediating is not going to make the cut. It is of extreme importance to me that it is mediated in such a way that all participants agree on via consensus. This mediation request did not reflect the wishes or feeling of the participants. Newyorkbrad seemed perfect for this, indeed even Beeblebrox supported having him close the RfC. I feel that we should leave the mediation\\/closure up to him. Best, - \nCycloneGU: Now, my intent was not to compare 200 or more users to a group of terrorists (I did accidentally use that word at first, that's what is crossed out as withdrawn).  However, Kingpin made a block threat calling it a personal attack.  I did have initial doubts about posting that comment, but decided to [[WP:BEBOLD|be bold]] and make the observation.  [[User:Beeblebrox|Beeblebrox]] agreed with my observation, and I think that is why the mediation appeared.  I'll await your further determination on what to do with it, and if it's determined unnecessary, I will accept your judgment.  \nNicholasTurnbull: Perhaps, in which case, there may be a case to be made for this going to [[WP:RFM]] if it's mediated at all by a process rather than the MedCab. (The only trouble with that is, ironically, you'd probably get me again.) But, are you aware that it is general Wikipedia precedent that users cannot select their mediators (it is specifically in the mediation policy that they can't), no more they can select the members of the ArbCom who decide their case? If there is a contingent of editors who wish to apply to one of the [[WP:DR]] processes on their own steam aside from a page discussion, they aren't doing anything wrong to request dispute resolution. --\nKingpin13: {{ec}}Originally the quote read \\\"terrorist group\\\" as oppose to \\\"hostage situation\\\". CycloneGU did indeed strike this, saying at the same time as doing so that he stood by his analogy (which consisted of describing a situation wherein a person is blackmailing and threatening to murder (see the quote above) and using that as a way to describe the opposition). Naturally being compared with a terrorist (or alternatively, if that word was a \\\"mistake,\\\" being compared to a person who blackmails and threatens murder (i.e. a terrorist)) was taken by me as an attack. And, as CycloneGU says (and I already stated), it does indeed appear that the mediation request was prompted by the discussion there, where Beeblebrox also agreed with CycloneGU's pre-struck comment about likening the opposition to terrorists. How or if this personal attack justifies the request, I am unclear on. -  \n\nBased on the conversation is Kingpin13 in a position of power? \n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either True or False with without using any other words.",

I spend a lot of time on Wikipedia trying to improve articles [yes it\\u2019s mainly on Turkish immigrants and minorities, but that\\u2019s '''my personal interest''', it has '''nothing''' to do with nationalism] and I have never been threatened with being blocked. Thus, I am offended by the way you have warned me, especially when I have spent hours using reliable academic source to improve this article. The only thing Takabeg is interested in is lowering the population of the community; if you looked at the history of the article you would have known this [or maybe you have misunderstood the dispute- or so I hope]. I am willing to discuss this issue with mediators etc. if required, but it's a shame that academic sources in all my contributions is not enough for you all. Good day to you.\nTurco85: So to sum up this confusing census debate, the 1957 census counted 567,000 Turkmens. However, due to political issues, the Iraqi government claimed that there were only 136,000 Turks. Furthermore, a year later they admitted that the '''very same census''' actually counted 567,000 Turkmen (more than 400% from the previous year\\u2019s claim). The census itself was published in '''1959'''. Thus, the published census says that there was 567,000 Iraqi Turkmen in 1957 not 136,800.\nTurco85: If we all know that the '136,800' figure was corrupt [as all the sources show], and we have sources which clearly state that the Iraqi government admitted that the population was actually 567,000, why on earth should we place a corrupt number in the info box? I think it is very misleading. \nBuckshot06: Thankyou Turco85. I apologise for my threats. Now, the book you said Takabeg cited says that the 136800 figure is the figure the Kurdish authorities claim. Would you please be very clear about which political agendas wish to cite which numbers, and please confirm exactly which agendas are involved. I need more than 'political issues' to try and thread the needle on this dispute. Kind regards \nTurco85: The political issues are quite complex, but here is an article which '''Scott Taylor''' (the author of the source above, which Takabeg provided), I'm sure [http:\\/\\/merryabla64.wordpress.com\\/2009\\/07\\/13\\/the-massacre-of-turkmens-in-kerkuk-on-14th-july-1959\\/ this article] will answer your questions. \n\nBased on the conversation is Buckshot06 in a position of power? \n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either True or False with without using any other words.",

It was only on January 23, 2011 that '''Paralympiakos''' reverted the changes without discussing them before doing it, which by the way [http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/w\\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:WikiProject_Mixed_martial_arts&diff=409813482&oldid=409597801 he did again]. \nL'Aquatique: I just noticed that, it was sort of a ways up the talk page so I didn't see it before. I warned [[User:Paralympiakos]] about edit warring, so if the issue continues to persist please let me know and I can intervene further. As far as I can tell from your discussion, this is a MOS issue, yes? \nJfgslo: Correct, mainly with capitalization ([[MOS:CAPS]]) and to a lesser degree with flag icons ([[MOS:ICON]]). Since it's an style issue, most editors appear to simply ignore the discussion and the Manual of Styles. Any suggestion to get more editors involved in this discussion? \nJfgslo: By the way, I mentioned the revert that '''Paralympiakos''' did because I didn't notice the warning in his talk page since it was removed. I thought you had forgotten to put it or that it was placed before the revert. \nL'Aquatique: In any case, you have a few options for getting more minds involved. I would start with a post on the [[WP:MOS|MOS]] talk page. We also have a [[WP:3|third opinion]] mechanism that brings an uninvolved editor into the arena, but that is essentially the purpose I am serving for you here, so you may not want to go down that route. You could also try opening a [[WP:RFC|request for comment]], but try the MOS talk page first because this seems like a pretty open and shut dealio. Hope that helps, let me know if there's anything else I can assist with. \nJfgslo: It's been already 3 days since I requested help at [[WT:MOS]] and there have been no responses so far. Even '''Paralympiakos''' has commented nothing on the issue, only leaving me a message in my talk page to stop correcting capitalization because it looks ugly. So far, only [[User:LOL|LOL]] has added something to the discussion. I still want to revert the changes made by '''Paralympiakos''' since he did not give solid arguments for doing it and I firmly believe that the way it is right now, [[WP:MMA]] is contradicting [[WP:MOS]], [[MOS:CAPS]] and [[MOS:ICON]] and wasting bandwidth unnecessarily, but I believe that if I make changes he will simply revert them back without discussing in the talk page of the project. What do you suggest that I do now? Do I wait, do I request help at [[MOS:CAPS]] and [[MOS:ICON]] or something else? \nL'Aquatique: I would make the change one more time, and if he reverts it open a [[WP:RFC|request for comment]] to bring more eyes to the subject. Also, make sure to mention [[WP:MOS|the MOS]] in your edit summary and keep it really low-key. If you open the RfC, avoid any sort of blame placing and word it something like, \\\"there's a dispute between several editors over interpretation of the Manual of Style.\\\"  \nJfgslo: I have followed your advice. I have once again [http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/w\\/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AWikiProject_Mixed_martial_arts&action=historysubmit&diff=410676899&oldid=409855759 changed the text of that section]. Now I'll wait to see if it's reverted again. \nJfgslo: I have a request. Could you comment on [[WT:MMA#MMA record table problems]] in response to '''Paralympiakos'''' most recent comment? I'm afraid that it might seem too personal if only I responded to him, since he, in my opinion, gave no valid reason and seems to simply want to ignore every guideline that he doesn't like. Please read his comments and let me know what you think. I honestly don't see what was the point of them other than expressing that he doesn't like those guidelines and that they should be ignored.  \n\nBased on the conversation is L'Aquatique in a position of power? \n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either True or False with without using any other words.",

    "206": "Jehochman: Sarah, unfortunately, left nebulous criticisms for me.  I have asked her to provide specifics.  I am disappointed that her prior support for me, and now opposition, appears to be unconnected to anything related to articles.  Fundamentally, we are here to write articles.  Every decision I make resolves down to the question of ''how will this affect the articles.''  Many during this election have said that they can't figure me out.  That's because there's nothing to figure.  Over time I have learned to reject all ideas of alliances, loyalties, animosities, or voting blocks.  Instead, I base decisions on what will be best for the articles. One day I may support somebody in one matter, and the next day I might oppose them in a different one.  If this upsets some people, so be it. \nJehochman: It's very bad when people get so overheated that they cannot even talk to one another. I am sad that it came to this, and I have withdrawn from the election as a result. \nOrderinchaos: Likewise I do not believe in alliances or loyalties - people earn my support through merit, even if they are friends, and I'm not averse to agreeing with an adversary if they are right, and have done so on at least two occasions. At times I know that I have upset friends through opposing them on here on various issues (sometimes even getting blocked on MSN for it), but if I strongly believe that they are wrong and that there's a wider principle involved, I would not be doing my duty to my own conscience (or to the project, arguably, as it voted for me to be an admin and hence expects me to do such things) if I did not act. People will obviously disagree about right and wrong, each person has their own barometer for what issues are critical and which can be left, etc. Certainly at this end I have not felt overheated - stunned, yes, in some ways disappointed, yes, but I've felt relatively little intense emotion about anything to do with Wikipedia for quite a while now. \nJehochman: Let's talk about things.  I recognize that I acted out of frustration and should not have posted my remark to Sarah's talk page.  I'd really like to understand why she mistrusts me.  Then I'd be able to address her concerns or change my behavior.  As things stand now, I am just left with nebulous criticism that is unactionable. Specific criticism has value. \nOrderinchaos: I agree that it's better to know what to change in order to change it, rather than just be aware there *are* concerns, but I'm probably not the most helpful person here, as you're asking about her concerns, not mine. \nJehochman: Of course.  Hopefully she'll let me know some day.  I've heard through the grape vine about some rumors that were circulated about me.  This leads me to believe that some folks may have heard stuff and made judgments without asking me.  Hopefully the word will get out that I am approachable and do not mind specific criticism.

Are these not important? \nFvasconcellos: No, that was a poor representation (having the wedge bond on only one leg), which really does suggest that the bridge is \\\"staggered\\\", although the stereochemistry was correct (and remains the same). The peroxide bridge pointing up vs. down is not an error. In my original structure, which I have since corrected and now matches Luk\\xe1\\u0161's in orientation, the entire molecule was flipped \\\"upside down\\\", so naturally the peroxide bridge would appear to be on a plane above rather than below the backbone of the structure. \nAxelBoldt: I understand that your original structure was flipped and that therefore the bridge was above rather than below, which is fine. However your methyl group at the base of the bridge was also above, and I think it should have been below. In any event, that has now been corrected. There's only one difference left between your structure and the structures in the books: the books show one bond of the lactone ring as a wedge going inside, whereas in your structure the lactone ring is shown to be flat. I don't know whether that makes a difference or not. \nFvasconcellos: Actually, that does make a difference; this structure (the one in the books, showing one bond of the lactone as a wedge) is not compliant with IUPAC rules\\u2014and is probably inaccurate. See page 300 of [http:\\/\\/vsites.unb.br\\/iq\\/litmo\\/qui_med\\/variacoes_modernas_farmacos\\/structure_activity_relationships_antimalaria_agent_artemisinin.pdf this article] for a 3D model of the crystal structure of artemisinin, showing its absolute configuration: the D ring is flat. (If we wanted to be fully compliant with IUPAC rules for representation of stereochemistry, the methyl group adjacent to the peroxide bridge should not be shown as a wedge either. See [http:\\/\\/www.rsc.org\\/Education\\/EiC\\/issues\\/2006July\\/Artemisinin.asp this article] for the most accurate structural formulae of artemisinin I have found so far.)  \n\nBased on the conversation is Fvasconcellos in a position of power? \n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either True or False with without using any other words.",

    "226": "Nsk92: Hello, Cgoodwin. I saw that you left messages at the talk pages of Ceranthor, Ret.Prof and Montanabw, where you seem to be talking about the RfA as being over already. Officially, your RfA is still open and is schedule to run until 08:10, 8 August 2010. If you wish to withdraw the RfA (which, IMO, would be a good idea at this point), the technical way to do that is to post a note at the RfA page itself, directly below your original acceptance note. \nJ04n: Hang in there and keep your chin up.  [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship\\/J04n|If at first]] you don't succeed [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship\\/J04n 2|try again]].  Take your time and answer the questions, you will only learn from the experience. <font face=\\\"Century Gothic\\\">\nHeymid: {{Edit conflict}} Comment to Nsk92: An RfA can't technically be withdrawn. The users make their decision, whether to support, oppose or be neutral. Then if the user gets a support percentage of all amount of users voting in the RfA after it is closed that is high enough, a [[Wikipedia:Bureaucrats|bureaucrat]] will assign the nominated user the administrator privileges. \\/\n{unknown-3723}: An RfA ''can'' technically be withdrawn by the candidate indicating he wishes for it to end. Then someone uninvolved can close it at that time. \\xb7\\xb7\\xb7\nHeymid: OK. I think I misunderstood him. How does it work when a bureaucrat closes an RfA? \\/\nNsk92: See reply at your talk page, [[User talk:Heymid]]. \nExcirial: Just work a bit as an editor in the administrative related area's such as vandalism and newpage patrol, and get some working experience and affinity with the policies related to them (I can guarantee you that they vary quite a bit from FA related rules, and that there are a lot of details). Once people see that you are knowledgeable in those area's you will breeze trough the next RFA. Or alternatively you might conclude that you don't like the maintenance work, and that you prefer writing article's. Either way, keep in mind that an admin is simply a Wikipedian-style cleaner with a bucket on his head, a mop in his hand and some sponge's under his soles. I know it sounds comical, but it is really quite accurate (In a figurative way). An admin is in no way more important or valuable then any other Wikipedian. \nBwrs: Sorry to see your RFA fail.  I was hoping that you could explain yourself better; you could have gotten my Neutral to turn into Support easily. \nOttawa4ever: same here, I voted neutral but that could have easily been a support. There were alot of queries thrown your way. I guess the trick to those is quality in answers over quantity. I hope you decide to run again in the near future. a little bit of tweaking, only a little and you should be fine, just take some time to read what people were looking for and you nail it next time. If you want to join the fight against the vandals there are many editors(myself included) who can teach you a few quick pointers to be up on on your way to build up a bit of experince. Any queries fire away, But do give RFA another shot down the road, youd be a fine admin one day :) \nAcps110: I'm very disappointed your RFA failed. You would definitely be a good admin for Wikipedia. Please shake it off and continue your excellent work here as an editor! I hope you will take the suggestions of your opposition to heart and put them into practice. I hope you will consider running for admin again in the future.  \n\nBased on the conversation is Excirial in a position of power? \n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either True or False with without using any other words."
