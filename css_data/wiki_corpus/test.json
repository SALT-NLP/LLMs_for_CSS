I must add however, that I'm still not persuaded that I personally will be able to work constructively with Blechnic, and I'm pretty unhappy about the current proposal floating around to have Blechnic checking the next update page for plagiarism. If that's what the current proposal is, then I think I might just sit on the sidelines for a while to see how well that works out. If that is not the current proposal, then I guess there is either going to be a discussion about what needs to happen as an alternative, or else it's business as usual. Whatever the case, I'm thinking that I myself might be taking a break from DYK for a few days anyway, as I'm afraid the drama over the last few days has, one way or another, managed to somewhat diminish my enthusiasm. Regards, \nIrpen: I tried to be more involved in helping ensure DYK quality but I stopped doing this since it is too stressful to deal with the authors of contentious articles who are committed to ensuring their stuff gets to main page whatever it takes. Some examples of my past attempts can be found at the archives of another DYK admins [[User_talk:Carabinieri\\\/Archive8#DYK_checking]], [[User_talk:Carabinieri\\\/Archive8#Relevance.3F]]. If there is any hope that we may see an improvement, I will try to help again. --\nBlechnic: --\nJayHenry: And I want a hippopotamus for Christmas.  I find it frankly incredible that you ''demand'' that Gatoclass do a job that you're unwilling to do yourself.  He is not your employee.  What's more, Gatoclass is ''demonstrably'' the one who cares about plagiarism and about the quality of DYK as he spends hours working on it and I've personally witnessed him stop dozens if not hundreds of flawed articles from reaching the main page.  His actions speak much louder than your words.  You are allowed to fine tune and review the process, but that has nothing to do with barking orders and insults at ''other volunteers''.  Brainstorming how to fix it is very welcome.  Blechnic, please, I completely agree there's a problem.  It's obvious to me that Gatoclass cares ''the most'', and that you care, and that the rest of us care as well.  We agree there's a problem; it doesn't mean we will agree with every proposed solution.  I can state with a great deal of certainty that yelling at Gatoclass is not even a small component of a solution (nor him at you).  He has agreed to no longer make this personal, can you please do the same, so that we can move forward? --\nBlechnic: And, yes, that makes perfect sense, Wikipedia's virus articles are a disaster, so take the viral editors and force them by being as disagreeable as possible to them to do something outside of their area of knowledge that no one already working in the area is doing.  Maybe if I'm the only one who can do DYK plagiarism checks it ought to come off of the front page.  --\nJayHenry: My intention was not to ''damn'' you.  I disagree with some of the things you're saying.  But just because I criticized aspects of your behavior does not mean my intent is to crap on you.  I want to discuss this, and I want to fix it, and along the way there will be disagreement.  When I disagree I will express this -- something I've done to Gatoclass many, many times on the DYK talk page in the past.  As for nobody sticking up for you, Carcharoth made a sincere and concerted effort to get people to back off of you.  I also made an attempt to de-escalate, even though I was angry that you accused me of not caring.  I really care a lot, and I really am trying to move this forward to finding some solutions.  I want to get this focused back on how to improve DYK, but I don't know how to do that at this point. --\nBlechnic: And, you know what else can't seem to make a dent?  If you have someone who writes well about a topic that they know that is poorly developed on Wikipedia, don't have them do tasks that other editors can do.  The articles I've added details on about plants and viruses have sat around underdeveloped and wrong for ages.  Articles about big major African trees that no one on Wikipedia knows are trees.  Rare hippo reserves that appear in articles, but no one knows these are places where hippos live.  Want a hippo all you want, but if you never know where to find them, you're not getting one.  --\nJayHenry: Blechnic, I am truly and sincerely sorry that I insulted you in the course of this.  My anger at being accused of not caring clouded my judgment.  I did not intend for my disagreement to ever come across as picking on you. --\nBlechnic: It's the primary reason I don't want to check for plagiarisms there: the plagiarisms will still be posted, and I will be part of it.  For all I've been accused of, you don't think I get a little angry, too?  --\nBlechnic: PS That little edit conflict with Bidgee was a good idea of the crap I get accused of and hounded about on Wikipedia.  You know, it's hard to get over a bad attitude, when what led up to it never ceases.  --\nJayHenry: I guess from an insider's point of view it seems like we get accused of not caring at all every time a mistake slips through, and get no credit for the thousands of mistakes that the project fixes. At one point I promoted an update where almost all the hooks were related to America. Because of my mistake everyone in DYK took a lot of criticism for not caring about the rest of the world, for perpetuating American hegemony. I have made other mistakes in doing the next update and I find it ''profoundly'' humiliating. Because I really do care, and I'm personally ashamed when I make a mistake, both because I've failed my own standards and also let down the rest of the project as well.  --\nBidgee: I've got this talk page in my watchlist (May have left a comment here in the past).

Or just different teams using the same name and respecting the name's history? --\nDemonJuice: A bit of both. The USL and MLS teams are certainly the same. Same website, same owners, same stadium, etc. In fact, the official roster for the MLS club is now at the exact same link the official roster for the USL club was at. The NASL and WSL\\\/APSL teams were certainly different entities but the club operates as if they were not as evidenced by the USL club retiring the number of a NASL player and continuing that on with the MLS club. \nBlackbox77: I think it might end up having to be an either\\\/or situation. Either we are going to say that yes, the NASL and MLS are the exact same club, or we believe they are two different clubs with the newer symbolically carrying the torch of the older. In my opinion, the fact that the MLS Timbers are honoring retired NASL numbers and associating themselves with the history of the name doesn't make them one-in-the-same with the original club. When the NASL Timbers folded, it was a definitive end to an organization. Now that MLS Timbers have chosen to pick up the name doesn't instantly mean the very same club has sprung back to life. Otherwise we'd just give them the same article, right? Now there might be an argument for the USL Timbers and MLS Timbers being one-in-the-same but that's probably a discussion for another time. I think most people\\u2013including Merritt Paulson and MLS in general\\u2013view the MLS Timbers as a brand new entity. Something that has never existed before...just with a name that has. They come across as being all the same in name only. --\nDemonJuice: I understand your argument and it has merit. Whatever the consensus turns out to be, I'll comply with it. There's a push to merge the Whitecaps articles and the arguments would be very similar for the Timbers. I'm not married to the template as is and I agree it is divergent from other MLS navboxes. Then again, the Timbers are a somewhat unique situation and what happens elsewhere on Wikipedia has never been a valid sole defense for what happens in a particular article.

It is, however, not ''your'' place to decide whether it is the case. There are only two ways in which the incompatibility of a lower level guideline with a higher-level policy can be determined&mdash;the community discussion and the ArbComm decision. As a member of the Wikipedia community, you have the same right as anyone else to identify the problems and fix them in the articles, being mindful to the fact that if your identification is challenged, you will need to [[WP:BRD|initiate a discussion]] nevertheless. You also have the same rights as anyone else to pinpoint the incompatibilities between the individual policies and guidelines. What you do ''not'' have a right to do with the guidelines is to unilaterally act on your own judgement&mdash;especially not when the discussion between ''other'' members of the community is ongoing. That is neither right nor civil. With that in mind, please revert your changes to the pages in question and kindly let others discuss the issue in a calm environment.\\u2014\nPmanderson: On the contrary, it is ''everybody's'' business.

I continue to enjoy creating some articles and editing others, and normally have good relations with other editors who improve the articles I create as well as those they and I mutually work on for improvements.  My question now is about the way one editor (Beyond My Ken) has deleted a number of images in the gallery I included on the article I created, \\\"Staten Island Ferry Whitehall Terminal.\\\"  (This is an editor who admits he went through a series of screen names because of problems during the time he used earlier ones.) Anyway, he deleted them as \\\"inappropriate,\\\" and I reinstated them (reverting his edit) asking that he explain why he thought they were inappropriate on the discussion page. His explanation was that \\\"wikipedia is not a gallery,\\\" and asked me to check \\\"WP:NOTGALLERY,\\\" plus \\\"WK:OWNERSHIP.\\\"  I understand ownership...and that all articles are collaborative, but when I checked \\\"not gallery,\\\" what I read was that no wikipedia article should be a \\\"mere gallery of photos,\\\" with just a little text thrown in. In this case, it's a solid article, which included a few photos in the article itself, but then I thought I enhanced it with additional photos.  I don't want to engage in an edit war by reverting his edit again - and besides, I'm not sure who is right. If you could take a look at the article and its history, and give me your opinion, I'd accept that view as authoritative. Thanks as always! (PS - I also did an article on the architect who designed the memorial, Frederic Schwartz. You can see from the history of the articles I create that when I do one, the next one is often one that \\\"flows\\\" from the research I did for an earlier one.  So I have done an article on a film, and then one on the director. In this case, I did on on the architect, and then on some of his works.  Anyway, the same editor struck out \\\"award-winning\\\" from the phrase \\\"award winning architect\\\" in the lead...even though the article includes a list of awards that the architect won.

A lot depends on how the current mega-debate at DYK turns out, but I've no doubt that wider attention will eventual turn to ITN once DYK is deemed to have been \\\"sorted out\\\" ;) \nMwalcoff: You're right -- there's a lot to do on WP, and there's no reason to get bogged down in something if it's stressful. I get enough stress in the rest of my life to worry too much about something like ITN. -- \nPhyschim62: Exactly! And I quite admit that I should maybe take my own advice sometimes ;) Best wishes, and hope to see you around somewhere soon! \nKehrli: -\nKkmurray: Thanks for the offer to help with informal mediation at [[Kendrick mass]]\\\/[[Kendrick (unit)]]. I will wait for what looks like a denial of my amendment request at ArbCom and then file a request for informal mediation if that seems appropriate. --\nKkmurray: I set up a Mediation Cabal case here: [[Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal\\\/Cases\\\/2010-11-21\\\/Kendrick_mass]] --\nPhyschim62: Thanks. I'm still waiting for a reply from Kehrli, but I do some background reading in the meantime. \nKehrli: Hi Physchim. I was not aware that you are waiting for a reply. Did I miss something? Sorry. What should I reply to? -\nPhyschim62: Sorry, I did wonder if you'd missed something. I made [[Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_arbitration\\\/Kehrli#Statement_by_Physchim62_2|this comment]] at the arbitration request, basically saying I don't agree with either side and that the dispute seems so minor (and technical) that it would be best resolved by mediation. Could you read through my short analysis (whether you agree with it or not, I'm not imposing that as a solution) and Kkmurray's summary of what s\\\/he sees as the dispute, and then let me know if you think mediation is a viable option? \nKehrli: \nPhyschim62: They're ratios of masses, of course. But be careful! A measurement of mass under SI is related through traceability to a ratio of the measurand to the mass of the International Prototype Kilogram. This goes to the basis of the definition of a unit, and is where I think both yourself and Kkmurray are mistaken in your arguments. \nPhyschim62: ''m''\\\/''z'' is unmeasurable at the molecular scale, at least in SI units. ''m''\\\/''z'' can be measured if you measure ''m'' in daltons, but this is equivalent to saying ''m''<sub>r<\\\/sub>\\\/''z'' in the International System of Quantities. \nPhyschim62: Disagree. \nPhyschim62: I didn't exactly want to write paragraphs on the topic. \nPhyschim62: Yes, my formula seems to be wrong. Such things happen, especially in a tense editing environment. \nPhyschim62: No, mass spectrometers work in the real world, where charge is quantized, and their output is interpreted on the basis of quantized charge, not continuous charge. \nPhyschim62: ''Q'' is continuous by convention, that is we can (and do) write differential equations involving d''Q''. Of course electric charge is quantized at the molecular level, and this was the distinction I was trying to get at. \nPhyschim62: I stand by my statement. The three different systems of units are related by experimentally determined physical constants; the relationships to those physical constants must be made explicit in order to express the uncertainty budget. However, I think there is a disagreement as to what constitutes a \\\"constant\\\" and what constitutes a \\\"unit\\\", so let's discuss this further. \nPhyschim62: But, before you accuse me of shying away from your second to last question, my PhD is in inorganic chemistry, homogeneous catalysis to be specific, but my latest scientific paper was submitted (still with the reviewers) to ''[[Metrologia]]'': it touches on the metrological consequences of the microscopic quantization of ''Q'', as it happens, although that is not its main thrust. So, do you want to thrash this out among scientists, or would you prefer to waste your time with ArbCom? \nPhyschim62: I dispute that the Ke is a unit of mass. It is only a unit of mass if you assume ''z''&nbsp;=1 (which, for all practical purposes, where the Ke would be used, is true). \nPhyschim62: \\\"Measure the magnetic field\\\" might be an unfortunate oversimplification: you measure the response of your apparatus for an ion of known  ''m''<sub>r<\\\/sub>\\\/''z'' (which depends on uncertain electric fields as well as uncertain magnetic fields). I was assuming negligible uncertainty in '''''E''''', which I admit is unphysical. Nevertheless, it is well known that it is easier to generate a precisely known '''''E''''' than a precisely known '''''B'''''. \nKehrli: \\\"... quantization of ''Q''\\\"? I really like that. You actually agree that ''Q'' is quantized. Ok, let's thrash this out. You are right, this will be much more fun than ArbCom ","84230":"Rjanag: I've left some comments at '''[[Wikipedia:Peer review\\\/The Time Traveler's Wife\\\/archive1]]'''.

As I've seen that you've amended the footnote, I thank you, but would you be willing to take it a step further to highlight that Adams has denied this?

Also, it is not an improvement, I do not intend to do anything upon your order, I have no obligation in working in your way under your request.  If you are not going to try to read this, so be it, it is not my fault.  It is on the other hand you fault to not be able to comply with the request I made here, on my talk page, that I do not want you to bother me anymore, and failed to understand the comments I made.  If you are failing to comply with my request, why should I try to comply with yours?  The world does not run around you, and you are not always right, I hope at least you have this knowledge.  Obviously, you are wrong this time, and if you wanted to accuse someone else, you are not going to have it your way.  I will give you an example, back in the days when people have not much knowledge, when a person came out and said the world is flat, it is the majority view.  Others do not have to write their own assertion on the view to make the view major.  It is not the truth and you are probably not going to find a lot of documents in the early days when people simply believed what they were told.(slight differences could be found in different mythological versions throughout the whole world)  That single view point was not minor at the time, yet you do not have other sources supporting them.(publication were scarce in those days as well.)  This is a very good example of why a single source is not necessarily a minority view.  If people agreed to it, they will not bother to write more on the topic.  Therefore, if one is claiming a present view point being minor, the best way to prove it is always bringing up the major view point s\\\/he claims, which you failed to do.  You might not agree with this, and I am aware of it, you do not have to answer this, you only need to know that I do not agree with your view point, and you are not going to get anything different here.  You can stay in your own private and comfort zone and THINK ALL YOU WANT that I did not answer your questions, and I cannot do anything about it since I am very sure that I have addressed everything you asked me, it is simply that you do not agree with my view points and we have no grounds of compromises and consensus.  You do NOT have to address that either, as I have told you earlier, all of these discussion are only your problem of not understanding the world does not revolve around you and others can well be opposing your view point and they do not have to follow your instructions.  You do not have to reply to any of these, as long as you understand I have replied your questions and you do NOT agree with my points, while the fact is that I do not agree with you and if you keep repeating the same thing, even if you are only stating I did not reply your points, you are bothering me, on my talk page, drawing unnecessary attention of me since there will be a new message alert whenever I login, and I will have nothing you will ever accept since I have answered your questions, you never accept it and I am not going to change my position since I do not see anything I did wrong.  It is fully understandable that you are in the same view as I do, your position is opposite of mine, thus you will not admit what I said is correct since that will put you in a position saying your actions are wrong.  I will further put it to you that your actions are not supported by others as well, so you may want to think over the matter and reconsider it thoroughly, yet that is not my request nor is it my concern that you will do it or not, I do not see any chance of you doing that and as long as you understand fully that I do not concern if you do it or not as long as you stop bothering me with your own view on things, unless you have changed your view point.  <small>\\u2014Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|signed]] comment added by<\\\/small> ","81741":"Grahbudd: --\nAwadewit: You're welcome.

But see what happens when you're willing to compromise the general [[WP:COMMONNAME]] guideline in the name of consistency with a more specific naming convention like [[WP:NC (flora)]], or dare I say it, U.S. cities?

Please bring my attention to any conflict where WP:COMMONNAME is being compromised.  Thanks. --\nBorn2cycle: By the way, I would prefer '''Bristlecone Pine (''x'')''' to [[Great Basin Bristlecone Pine]].  The most common name for this tree is simply Bristlecone Pine, and the title of the article should reflect it.  The fact that that name is ambiguous is a separate issue.  I don't know if the Great Basin species qualifies for primary usage over the other uses, but I doubt it.  That means [[WP:PRECISION|more precision]] is necessary in the title, and adding \\\"Great Bristlecone\\\" at the beginning is one way to do it, but it also wrongly implies that that is the most common name.  So I would prefer '''Bristlecone Pine (''x'')''', with ''x'' being ''Great Basin'' or even ''Pinus longaeva''. [[Bristlecone Pine (Great Basin)]] or [[Bristlecone Pine (Pinus longaeva)]] would correctly specify the most common name used to refer to the topic of the article, and still appropriately disambiguate from the other uses.  --\nHesperian: When people say \\\"Bristlecone pine\\\" they are referring to a taxonomic section comprising three species. They might not know that there are three species, and they might not know that together they comprise a section, but the fact remains that when someone says \\\"Bristlecone pine\\\", the set of plants they are circumscribing comprises a section not a single species. You might just as well argue over which species of ''Acer'' is meant when people say \\\"maple\\\". The fact is they are not referring to a particular species at all; they are referring to the genus. \nRkitko: Apologies to Vegaswikian for butting in on this talk page, but I had some things to offer. First, calling us a cabal is simply a mischaracterization. The naming guideline we produced is the only logical guideline you can readily agree upon when you know ''anything'' about this subject. To back up that assertion, I submit the plethora of [[User:AlexNewArtBot\\\/PlantsSearchResult|new articles]] that are added to the project daily. I've watched this list for as long as it's existed and new editors, anon editors, established editors who took a chance and created a flora article all probably without knowledge of [[WP:NC (flora)]] invariably create their article titled at the species name. It's [[WP:UCS|common sense]]. You clearly are off the tracks of common sense if you think that [[Bristlecone Pine (Pinus longaeva)]] fits the naming convention guidelines better than ''[[Pinus longaeva]]''. You seem to be forging ahead on a misguided attempt to fit all naming conventions into the restrictions of a few sentences, forgetting others like \\\"Titles should make linking to the article simple.\\\" Your wikilawyering is tiresome. When we created the flora naming convention, we weighed the provisions of the policy and came up with something that fit as many as possible and that used our common sense. The fact that it doesn't fit into your world of perfectly aligned conventions to one of those policy provisions is irrelevant. For the sake of brevity, I will simply say that I completely understand your position, but I disagree with your conclusions. It's overwhelmingly and painfully obvious, however, that you simply do not understand what I and others like Hesperian are arguing for. How can we have a discussion over a convention that you don't understand when all attempts to educate you on our reasoning have failed?

I'd forgotten about my follow-up comment above (dated 04:25, 16 December 2009 (UTC)), but it's as true today as it was then. Ottava simply can't (or hasn't demonstrated a way to, at least) effectively contribute to the English Wikipedia. Thousands of people have found ways to edit here without incident; several thousands more [[Special:Log\\\/block|have not]]. I don't see this as a strike against Ottava necessarily, but I do see it as the reality. I don't think the passage of time has changed his behavior or attitudes, having read some of his writings elsewhere in the intervening period.

While I haven't exactly been away, I tend to shy away from disputes not directly related to pages I am heavily involved with, and I haven't been heard from on this page in nine months. But I am now breaking my silence. There were certainly strongly positive aspects to my collaboration with Ottava when he was active (anything negative I will let rest among the bygones), and I would welcome him back ''if and only if'' he (1) formally requests his unbanning according to whatever official procedures there are, and (2) the kinds of restrictions suggested above by Moni, iridescent, and others are applied. Under these conditions, I hope to be able to say, \\\"Welcome back, Ottava! and let's get back to working together to provide the world with all kinds of interesting facts about English literature of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.\\\" --\nJack Merridew: '''Question:''' Did I miss a {{tl|wikijoint}}??

I find this statement most perplexing and perceive it as being demonstrably false. Perhaps you meant to say something else? Like Ottava hasn't exhibited a consistent attitude conducive to collaboration? Simply writing an article to FA standards exhibits the ability to contribute effectively to English Wikipedia. What's your definition of contributing effectively? --\nMZMcBride: Apologies, that sentence is really ambiguous. I meant \\\"effectively contribute\\\" in the sense that he hasn't been able to do so without getting himself banned. It isn't a matter of the quality of his content contributions at all. But there is a social component here. We have a lot of editors who aren't the most social people, but who are able to contribute content without making a fuss. Ottava clearly isn't one of them. --\nGatoclass: '''Conditional support''' - I was always of the opinion that the original ban was unduly harsh, but if there is to be a move to reinstate Ottava's editing privileges, they must come with clear conditions. One condition I would want to see is to have Ottava banned from any discussions that do not directly concern article content, as he has shown far too much interest in wikidramas and meta-discussions that do not concern him in the past. I would also like to see the bar lowered for blocks, so that admins can block him for brief periods (of, say, up to a week) when he starts filibustering or making personal attacks. \nLing.Nut: +S, perhaps conditionally. It would be nice to see one of these rehabilitation movement thingies actually work. However, if conditions are laid on the unban, I strongly support the idea that OR should follow the program (or whatever ya wanna call it), since Wikipedia as a community deserves to be listened to at least as much as any individual Wikipedian. Whatever the hell that means. &bull;&nbsp;\nYomangani: '''Oppose'''. I can't be arsed to read the small print of the (no-doubt interminable) Arbcom case, but presumably if he serves out his full ban he can return unrestricted. If so, why would he want to return early and put up with months of cap-in-hand-begging-your-pardon-your-worship when it appears that he has no problem contributing to the encyclopedia from afar? If he is still the same intractable hornet that the community found so unbearable previously, then why imagine that he will pay attention to any conditions imposed? If he has reformed, then why would any conditions be necessary? Lift the ban unconditionally and deal with him if he starts playing up, the same as with any other user; Arbcom has already shown it has no problem with banning him should he become even slightly irksome. (This is mind-reading of course, he may be only too keen to return under the cosh).\nGatoclass: Allowing him back with no restrictions will eventually just lead to another ban in my opinion. IMO it would be better to let him back with some restrictions and see how that works out. \nYomangani: Either he is reformed or he is not. If he is reformed there is not a problem. If he is unreformed then your choice is have him kick against his restrictions or against the wider system. Both eventually lead to a ban. Restrictions only have the advantage of belittling him. \nIridescent: For the benefit of those who aren't aware, [[Wikipedia:Arbitration\\\/Requests\\\/Case\\\/Mattisse\\\/Monitoring|there ''is'' a precedent]] for \\\"return under strictly controlled conditions\\\". Yes, that particular case didn't work out too well, but the structures are there.&nbsp;\\u2013&nbsp;<font color=\\\"#E45E05\\\">\nMoni3: \\\"Didn't work out too well\\\" in English is \\\"zOMG! spectacular FAILBOAT!!1!\\\" and I'm aware that I was involved in that case and none too happy with how it was carried out. I think it might have worked out well if several aspects of the case were different. I understand where Yomangani is coming from, however. It's a matter of economics: how much time does the community, and really, a handful of admins, want to spend watching and attempting to curtail the nutty behavior of one prolific content editor? How much does that content editor want to participate in Wikipedia? I think it's worth trying out for a bit. If it fails, it fails. --\nYomangani: Yes, but the time the community (or those admins) spends trying to enforce the restrictions is the same or more than would be spent curtailing other unacceptable behaviour. Most of the Matisse mentorship revolved around determining restrictions, proper forms for raising issues, limits of responsibilities, requests for clarifications etc. etc. There were probably only a handful of incidents in those months and reams of arguing. It's a wikilawyer's paradise. The restrictions are already in place - they are the same restrictions that all other editors face. \nLing.Nut: Actually, I see Yomangan(i)'s point: we cannot control the behavior of others, despite our best wishes. <s>If there is any<\\\/s>One value in restrictions <s>at all, it<\\\/s> is a symbolic one: that the editor is willing to be bound to them is a show of good faith. Etc. Another is the hope that such restrictions lead a person to a new self-awareness etc. But... if the ban hasn't already done that, will the restrictions? I give up. Just make sure I'm not on any d*mn mentor list. Over and out. &bull;&nbsp;\nCool Hand Luke: Ottava can write his articles wherever he wants. From my perspective, expressly allowing intermediaries to imports his articles from off-site is a win-win for the project as we get his good works without his bad behavior. I wish this status quo was expressly endorsed by ArbCom. (Note: I'm recused on the Ottava on ArbCom, and I'm happy to once again find myself in agreement with MZMcBride.) \nElen of the Roads: I don't either - just wanted to make that clear.  But I bet someone suggests it for real. --\nGatoclass: In a sense, Ottava is ''already'' \\\"editing with restrictions\\\", since he's still making contributions that are just being posted by his buddies. So some restrictions really ''do'' work. I do think though that the current de facto \\\"system\\\" is far from ideal and that we'd be better to let him back with some clear restrictions on where he is and isn't allowed to post in order to limit his potential for disruption. If in addition, we say, added a condition that he is not permitted to appeal a ban of a week or less, he might be sufficiently defanged to be considered a net asset. \nTony1: '''<s>Support''', but only with high expectations of a fresh approach to avoiding drama.

I said it before and say it again: the idea of mentors who are selected because \\\"they have tangled with this person before and will drop the hammer\\\" is moonbats at best, and sneaky\\\/vindictive at worst. The idea of a friend being a mentor is just a really good way to break the mentor's heart and cause burnout. The mentor would have to have '''no''' relationship to the telemachus, can't be too kindhearted, but can't be too hangin' judge either. The mentor must deal with shit. It's a thankless task and a burnout generator. &bull;&nbsp;\nSlimVirgin: The problem with the mentoring system is that the mentors often end up as advocates, because relationships form and empathy deepens. That's why, as Tony said, it would have to be someone able to maintain complete independence, but in a situation like this that would place the mentor under a great deal of pressure from the mentoree, to the point where it would be unlikely to work. <font color=\\\"blue\\\">\nLing.Nut: The problem with the mentor system is that no one on the planet knows the correct things to say or do to help someone fully realize and (more importantly) fully accept that their view of reality is fundamentally and destructively incorrect, integrate this knowledge into their worldview, and emerge a more whole person... I'm not talking about insanity; just about gaping blindspots and\\\/or colored glasses of various types. The latter in particular, I suppose.

Also, it makes it look like all or some (impossible to tell which, which is a major part of the problem) of the operettas in the Operetta Category have not been subcategorized. \nSsilvers: English.  The piece is loosely adaptated from L'Oncle Celestin by [[Edmond Audran]], a French piece.

I believe that Wikipedia's userbox guidelines are ''too restrictive'' according to what you have stated.  Those guidelines [[WP:CSD#T1|only apply to Template namespace]] and in the [[Wikipedia:Userboxes]] gallery.  They do not apply at [[Wikipedia:Userbox migration]] or userspace.  You have strict standards yourself, and they are stricter than what the Wikipedia policy pages say.  You are ignoring the purpose of [[Wikipedia:Userbox migration|User namespace]].  Not only that, but also I feel that Wikipedia policies are going out of hand.  The userboxes containing the word \\\"prefers\\\" that I created are ''not'' intended to be divisive or to lend itself to negative comparison.  Those are only opinion, not blatant criticism.  Not all negativity is divisive, and those that connote dislike are not necessarily intended to be divisive.  If I disagree with the deletion of that userbox on the grounds of being considered divisive, I put on there \\\"not intended to be divisive.\\\"  Most Internet forums teach that one has to respect others' opinions.  If I dislike something, that does not mean that I will attack someone who likes something I dislike.  The phrase \\\"can slightly tolerate\\\" is a neutral verb phrase, meaning neither positive nor negative.  The words \\\"believes\\\" and \\\"thinks\\\" are not always divisive or used to suggest negative comparison.  One example is \\\"This user thinks that ... is the best ... of all time.\\\"  That is considered positive, because it is using a positive superlative adjective, basically stating that it is one's favorite thing in a field.  I do not create userboxes in Template namespace in any way.  I believe that the Userbox policy is going out of hand, by spilling the policies into User namespace.  I decided not to userboxes I created into [[Wikipedia:Userboxes]] anymore. \nAlison: ''\\\"I have accused you of abuse of administrative power\\\"'' - that's a pretty strong statement there. May I suggest that if you believe JC37 has abused hir position of admin, that you take a case to [[WP:ANI]] and allow the admin community to review it and act accordingly.

I have written on the talk page. Sorry! -- \nTimtrent: Accidents happen in the best regulated families :) \nTimtrent: I was not casting aspersions at all.  Edit summaries have a reasonably long, but finite, space to summarise what one has done.  I was stating that your second reversion was ill explained.  I stand by that phrase and made it unemotionally because I perceived that you had reverted in each case without regard to the content, and had simply looked at process, relying on VP as an infallible guide.  I will look at the other editor's talk page, but wanted to reply to you without being influenced by that first.  \nTimtrent: Now I have read your explanation.  I see it as both reasonable and uneasonable in equal measure.  The other editor made a misassumption that VP was a bot.  I think you may then have made a misassumption that s\\\/he was acting in some way that was malicious, or unwise, or without regard to content (or something else) and thus made your own reversion without regard to content.  Vandals do make multiple edits, but have seldom made sensible edits.  Errors happen when one is working to protect Wikipedia.  I'm sorry my edit summary troubled you.  \nSsbohio: To take you through my thought process:  I saw the ''reverted bot'' edit summary for a reversion by [[User:Gazpacho|Gazpacho]] that restored deletions originally made by [[User:Gazpacho|Gazpacho]].  This led me to consider that either the edit summary was incorrect due to a misunderstanding of [[WP:VP|VP]] or that the edit summary was incorrect as a means of supporting the redeletion of the content.  [[WP:AGF|Assuming good faith]], I reverted the edit as being likely mistaken based on its edit summary, but, either way, my course of action would have been the same.  I don't necessarily see it as ''unreasonable'', however.  I left an edit summary explaining that [[User:Where|Where]] was not a bot.  When the deletion was restored again (within minutes), it raised a related but distinct issue.  My concern at that point was not whether the content should be deleted, but that, if deleted content was restored to the article (twice), consensus-building was called for to support its deletion.  Nonetheless, I was unwilling to make a [[WP:3RR|third reversion]] of the content, but I felt confident that [[User:Gazpacho|Gazpacho]] would be similarly constrained.  The content dispute could then be discussed & resolved before [[User:Gazpacho|Gazpacho]] moved forward with the deletion.  While I was surprised & somewhat dismayed at your redeletion,  I can also see that it's a case of us all doing what we think is \\\"right.\\\"  Like an admin protecting [[Wikipedia:the wrong version|the wrong version]] of an article, whether the deleted material was restored or removed, someone would think it was the wrong thing to do.  In general, my preference (& my editing history) is one of [[Wikipedia:Harmonious editing club|harmonious edits]] rather than [[Wikipedia:Edit war|edit warring]].  In this case, however, I felt a second reversion was warranted to restore content deleted without apparent consensus or discussion, based on the principle that included content should remain so unless consensus warrants removal.  To be clear, my involvement was not content-based, but rather based in my belief that [[WP:PII|process is important]].  At no time did I see [[WP:VAND|vandalism]] in anyone's actions, but I felt that the removed content should be restored until its removal could be discussed.     I know this is a bit long-winded, but I wanted to take the time to demonstrate to you that my actions were policy based and not intended to take one side or another in the content dispute. --\nTimtrent: The difference in process?  When I revert what I believe may be vandalism I always look at the content I am reverting.  I make mistakes, too.  I do not say that my way is better, it simply give me more confidence.

It appears that there are 2-3 POV pushers who seem to be exceedingly patient in the matter.  One of the pushers complains that he's a \\\"pot smoking liberal\\\" but doesn't agree with the lack of NPOV on the ID article.  As a matter of fact, very few \\\"liberals\\\" brag about their pot smoking.  I don't inhale whenever I do.  Another of the POV-pushers uses a technique of throwing in dozens of edits.  Most of them look very legitimate but two or three are in fact very POV (anti-Evolution, in this case).  Another one just keeps pushing the anti-Evolution POV over and over.  [[User:Guettarda|Guettarda]] has indicated that there might be some interesting activities afloat to push a pro-religion agenda, and they are very careful as to how they do it.  These users appear to be doing so.   Another issue is that the several editors who have stood up to the POV-pushers aren't around.  I've given up, because frankly, it's not worth responding to every bogus argument they make.  Then if you do accuse them of their POV pushing, they file an [[WP:ANI]], which takes more time.  I'm frustrated by what's happening.  ID is nothing more than a subtle religious argument for creationism.  Why is there such discussions going on?

Power is cubic in the speed, so it would increase quadratically. The source says that the drag is <math> \\\\rho A V^2  <\\\/math>, so when one speaks of the drag's increase with speed, not the drag itself, why  is it not the derivative of that expression, i.e. the drag increases linearly with speed? \nAndrewDressel: Ah, now I see. It appears to be just an issue of semantics, not mathematics. You are interpreting \\\"is quadratic in\\\" to be equivalent to \\\"increases linearly with\\\". However, the cited source, in discussing air drag explains that \\\"the force exerted by the drag is seen to increase as the square of the velocity.\\\" The author does not use the derivative of the derived expression to describe how a change in velocity translates into a change in drag. Instead, he uses the original, quadratic relationship. For example: doubling speed results in a four fold increase in drag, even though the derivative of the drag with respect to velocity is proportional to the velocity and not its square. -","191781":"The Halo: Hi Randy, I'm sorry to hear that you're RfA did not pass.

Documentaries are not created equal, if the focus in a documentary is about a fringe topic, then very little of it is usable as anything other than a presentation of views within the context of that fringe. On the other hand if the documentary is well-balanced, journalistic, presenting the mainstream viewpoint succinctly, and addressing when views are fringe, then comments\\\/statements\\\/views could be usable. ZDF here makes it clear that this is <u>about<\\\/u> a conspiracy theory, and as such it may be a source to such conspiracy theories - but again context matters. --\nA Quest For Knowledge: It's [[WP:UNDUE]] anyway.

It's in German, however. You can see that it includes interviews with various people who offer different viewpoints. While the documentary sometimes refers to \\\"conspiracy theories\\\", the interviewees that offer views that differ from the official explanation are generally not being described as \\\"conspiracy theorists\\\". For example, at 15:14, the documentary refers to [[Architects and Engineers for 9\\\/11 Truth]] as \\\"a group of architects and engineers\\\" that have joined \\\"to critically review the official investiagations into September 11. Richard Gage is a member of the American Institute of Architects and has practiced in California for 20 years.\\\" It also refers to the group's members as \\\"experts\\\". Some of the factual statements rather support viewpoints from interviewees that agree with the conclusions of the official investigations, while other statements support views from interviewees who disagree with those conclusions.

Kim, the reports regarding the collapse of the World Trade center are pretty boring to read. One of the problems with the article [[Collapse of the World Trade Center]] is that for it to be even a good article, much less a featured one, we need some editors with structural engineering and related disciplines to improve the engineering aspects of that article...much of the engineering reports about how the buildings collapsed is technical jargon not easily translated into more easily readable prose. There have been more than a dozen independent engineering studies conducted on various aspects of the collapse, some dealing with metallurgy, others that have examined fire and others that have investigated design issues. When the U.S. Government first started working on finding out how the buildings collapsed, (aside from the obvious which was high speed impact by wide body jets, extensive fires, and peripheral damage to surrounding structures and infrastructure), they appointed the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to lead the investigation...that agency specializes in disaster response more than engineering in itself...so after preliminary reports came out from FEMA, the questions regarding how the buildings collapsed were not adequately addressed, so the feds had the National Institude of Standards and Technology (NIST) take over since they have that expertise, though had never had to deal with such a massive study..hence, the final reports took years to produce. These reports (and again, they aren't \\\"fun\\\" to read) can be found by following the links from [http:\\\/\\\/wtc.nist.gov\\\/ this page I've linked here]...these same reports are cited in various articles on this website as well.--\nMONGO: Cs32en...that Richard Gage guy is a bit off his rocker it seems...[http:\\\/\\\/screwloosechange.blogspot.com\\\/2007\\\/06\\\/richard-gage-aia-and-crackpot.html]--\nKimDabelsteinPetersen: I have to admit that i didn't even look at your translation :) As for the rest, probably correct - but i have enough with one area that is overrun with conspiracy theory.

I still have time to edit quite a bit, though I rarely reach the 1000 edits a month mark nowadays. It also depends on what and how you edit: I've made a lot of small improvements to articles, whether a lot of other users have created entire articles in only a few edits. Remember though, that 10,000 edits that are a mixture of article creation and improvement and vandal-fighting is a lot more valuable than 100,000 edits to a user page. :) Best wishes. \nKtr101: That is true.

It says \\\"All Wikipedia articles and other encyclopedic content must be written from a neutral point of view, representing fairly, and as far as possible without bias, '''''all significant views''''' that have been published by reliable sources.\\\" There is a major point of view that he shouldn't have received the award, so it is very controversial.

There is no reason why it shouldn't be mentioned where it states he received the prize. It isn't taking a up a lot of space, and it isn't making the introduction significantly longer. It is one word that makes the sentence much more descriptive. As for the communistic intentions, it is not vandalism.

What me remains for to do, since you do not read the rules of Wikipedia. \nArmOvak: According to the rules of Wikipedia this image or logo Zvartnots airport aia.png only consists of typefaces, individual words, slogans, or simple geometric shapes. These are not eligible for copyright alone because they are not original enough, and thus the logo is considered to be in the public domain.

Well, I agree with you on the account to download from the internet, but if it's my picture, the author of this work I, needed to take into account the fact that architects are dead. As I have already said they would now, more than 100 years. And again I repeat, I can give you 1000 photos of the buildings, constructed recently that have been uploaded to Wikipedia without the permission of their authors. Therefore, if we consider each such photograph, the result is such that no picture shall be added to Wikipedia without the agreement of the architects of those or other buildings. \nwknight94: I have heard Wikipedia handles photographs of buildings differently than Commons.  At Commons they get deleted unless the buildings are in the public domain or the country has [[:Commons:COM:FOP|freedom of panorama]] - which Armenia does not.  Notice how French building pictures [[:File:Tour-Total.jpg]] and [[:File:Areva1.jpg]] are at Wikipedia, not Commons, under an ''unfree'' fair use license.  Also, it doesn't matter if the architects are dead - their work does not pass into public domain until 70 years ''after'' they died.  <span class=\\\"wknight94sig\\\">\nArmOvak: Yes, but this is the case, if first is the art is protected by law, and my photos are not protected by law they are allowed to freely use. Secondly under the laws of the United States reproductions of two-dimensional art objects (paintings, photographs, book illustrations) are not objects of copyright, except, if you create original prints were made creative contributions (eg, the effects of retouching). The same applies to the scanned images. \nwknight94: That is all irrelevant in multiple ways.  First, your photograph is of a ''three''-dimensional building.  Second, the original art objects (paintings, photographs, book illustrations) are still ''themselves'' copyrighted, so any reproduction of them could be violating the original artist's copyright.  Third, you are quoting United States law, but your photograph is of a building in Armenia, not the United States.  <span class=\\\"wknight94sig\\\">\nArmOvak: As you can see the original pictures created are me.

Just look at the quality of most new articles and how well researched and objective they are in about a year.

Each of the Guild's coordinators will copy edit one article per day for however long it takes to completely reduce the backlog. We should start with the oldest requests first, then work our way to the more recent requests. As it has happened before, there are probably several users who requested a copy edit of an article in July that are dissatisfied because their request hasn't been taken care of yet. Also, to prevent this from ever happening again, I think at least one of our coordinators and several volunteers should keep a constant eye on the Requests page in between Backlog elimination drives. What do you think? \nSMasters: I think we can't rely on the coordinators alone. Why don't we offer a Working Man's barnstar to anyone who does 2 or more from the Requests page this month? No need to make it so formal. Maybe an ombox on the RP and an ad on the Reward Board will be sufficient. We can look at all articles archived at the end of the month and we can see who has done what. This will give everyone an opportunity to help out, and not restrict it to just coordinators alone. Of course, as coordinators, we should also pitch in. But I know that even one a day for me is currently impossible with my current workload in RL.

Just a quick note to thank you for voting on [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship\\\/TigerShark|my RfA]], which recently passed '''62\\\/13\\\/6'''. I want to let you know that I will do my best to address all concerns that were raised during the RfA. I will also do my very best live up to this new responsibility and to serve the community, but please [[User talk:TigerShark|let me know]] if I make any mistakes or if you have any feedback at all on my actions. Finally, if there is anything that I can assist you with - please don't hesitate to ask. Cheers \nSplash: ''Please'' don't call it that. I unprotect what others forget to is all. (Plus the occasional difference of opinion.) Interesting data, though. -\nTawker: What would you say to an expiry option on the protect button, similar to the block expiry? -- \nSplash: Perhaps. I talked about this with FoN a while back. I can certainly see the sense, since admins are very forgetful (and then get upset when I remember for them...). But I rather fear we'd finish up with a similar situation to what happens when someone shortens a block. We'd also likely legitimise the \\\"indefinite\\\" option which is something I am deeply uncomfortable with. I know that all protections are indefinite at the moment, but not in the same way as having a menu option for it. -\nTawker: I think the issue with having to keep the infinite button around is some pages have to be fully protected all of the time.  Imagine if we unprotected the front page or the [[WP:AWB|AWB]] checkpage.  All that being said, protection is a necessary evil sometimes, something best avoided. I don't know about people complaining about shortening of an protection, the protection really is a stop gap measure (that can possibly stop a lot of godo faith editors from editing) whereas the block restricts (hopefully) one person.  It's food for thought, if I have time I might draft up a proposal for it.  On a second note, if you have itme could you take a look at [[User:Tawkerbot2\\\/FAQ]] - its an FAQ page for the bot that hopefully explains what it does in a newbie friendly way, I don't know how it reads from someone who doesn't know its inner workings, and I'm a little concerned it might be too \\\"geek speekish\\\". Cheers -- \nSplash: Those examples are true; I hadn't considered those. Actually, I think people would take the appearance of the option as sanction for the ''use'' of the option, when even on [[George W. Bush]] there is at best an uneasy truce regarding this rather than any consensus supporting it. If you decide to make a proposal, taking it to [[WT:SEMI]] would be the place to start, I guess. Or maybe [[WP:PPol]]. I copyedited the FAQ. I think it's good. -\nBD2412: Here's a thought - how about a button that allows a maximum protection time of seven days for things in the article space. That way, continued protection after the expiry would at least have to be someone's conscious act. \nCan't sleep, clown will eat me: It would be nice if there was an optional protection expiration date, similar to how administrators are able to block for a definite amount of time (15 minutes, 24 hours, permanently, et cetera).  Are the developers able to implement this?  \nTawker: With respect to the hard limit on protection, the only disadvantage I see to this is the deleted pages that we protect to prevent re-creation, maybe an override for 'bcrats and ArbCom \\\/ Stewards \\\/ Jimbo might be necessary. I was just on the tech channel and Rob Church says there's a bug report for it somewhere (and being stupid and not finding the right keyword, I haven't found the URL yet) but it looks like it might be dooable (though probally on the list of bugs to fix its faster 550 or so) -- \nSplash: I like the idea of having to consciously renew protection in article space. Tawker's problems remain, though and I'm not sure that handing it to bureaucrats is necessarily desirable given their marginal activity levels, but they'd have very few pages per day\\\/week to actually handle and they'd not be critical immediately. Perhaps a function to mark as a {deletedarticle} is the way to handle it, though we're left with [[Main Page]] and the other mission-critical pages to deal with. So maybe, as cscwem suggests, just port the blocking interface to the protection interface; presumably the additional code is small. I'd like to see \\\"indefinite\\\" suppressed from that list, though. Or maybe we'd have to SHOUT about a new convention: in the same way we don't indef-block IPs even though we could, we don't indef-protect articles. I'm thinking out loud here, really. -\n{unknown-5202}: Or it could be easier to create a dynamically-generated Special: page, like [[Special:Longprotected]], that would list all the pages that have been left protected for, let's say, 30 days or more. The problem with the current category scheme is that you can't figure out which pages were protected ten minutes ago and which ones are permanently protected. \nKelly Martin: It would be relatively easy to write a query on the toolserver for that purpose. \nSplash: Oh, that'd be great. Something like the PROD listing, maybe. It'd making cleaning [[CAT:SEMI]] much less painful and time-consuming than it is at the moment. I guess, if that can't be done by some willing toolserverite, that we could use the auto-dating that the {{tl|nsd}} uses, although it would mean substing the template into article space which is suboptimal. -\nBD2412: '''''GENIUS''''' - a prod for seeing articles that have been semi'd too long (though I'd make them show up before 30 days). \n{unknown-5203}: I'm not sure running it on the toolserver is a good idea, as we're killing it... it has a 1.5 day lag already.

Medieval noble families tried to improve their ancestry by creating imaginative genealogical links between them and some famous ruler. I would be very careful, without support in other sources. Thus I removed the claim. \nFaustian: You are correct, and the info is listed as a claim, not The Truth (I'll reword it).

If you recall, I both endorsed your promotion to admin, and defended you in the debate from critic&#8217;s who saw you as biased on topics just such as the one we are now discussing. I said then, and I would like to be saying in the near future, how marvelously NPOV and easy to communicate with that you are. It has been my experience generally that the majority of arguments are due to misunderstandings, rather than precise differences.

I could, say, easily forswear any use of A1\\\/A3 for six months while I think about it, however it can also be argued that if I am to improve my practical interpretation then it would be a good idea to show my use of these CSD categories appropriately. Is there an existing consensus about the best approach to improvement? Thanks \nWereSpielChequers: Hi F\\xe6,I don't think it would be a good idea to forswear use of a particular CSD category as they all have their value. But a promise never to tag A1 or A3 in the first ten minutes might be helpful. I'm very cautious both with CSD tagging and deletion, I suspect I'm rather more cautious than the majority of the community. Mostly I use CSD to deal with bad faith edits, author requests for deletion and articles that effectively assert non-notability. I decline a sizable minority of tags that are incorrect, and there are loads of quite legitimate A7 tags that I leave because in my view speedy shouldn't mean instant when it comes to goodfaith articles. There are a whole set of essays and at least one survey on my userpage. You might also look at [[wp:NEWT]] when a bunch of us created alt accounts that then submitted articles, we had enough not deleted to rebut the original press criticism that any new article was guaranteed to be deleted. But a lot were tagged, so it did yield an interesting list of incorrect tags. ''\nF\u00e6: Thanks, when things are quieter I'll take time to ponder the essays and absorb them properly. In the meantime I'll think about adding a commitment about it to my talk page (though I don't plan say anything about commitments in my RFA as I probably should be judged on my edit history rather than promises about the future). Cheers \nWereSpielChequers: I think that commitments can play a part in RFA. In my first RFA I shifted my settings from a default to minor edits to the reverse, other people have amended signatures and created alt accounts. A promise not to tag A1 and A3 articles in their first ten minutes is in my mind a credible RFA commitment - we had another candidate recently who had been tagging G10s as A7s and that wasn't something you could fix that quickly - they'd have needed a b period of editing where they'd demonstrated better tagging. ''\nF\u00e6: I have made a commitment on my talk page, let me know if you spot any wording improvements that could be made.

He's not violating the letter of the unblock, but perhaps the spirit. Looking through his report, he's likely right. Those were Jeff Merkey socks. Is reporting socks disruptive in and of itself disruptive. I'd say no. The action of going through every old article that Jeff Merkey ever edited was the disruptive action.

That is the only thing that will put an end to this, if you want it to end. <font color=\\\"blue\\\">\nPfagerburg: I am really tired of you willfully distorting what I have clearly written, refusing to read what I wrote, and then mis-stating the facts that are there for everyone to see. You and I are done, until such time as you are actually willing to read what has already been written. \nSlimVirgin: The fact remains that for almost four years you've been posting on Wikipedia about Merkey to the exclusion of virtually everything else. That should give you pause. I agreed to your unblock on the understanding that you'd be editing in general, and not about Merkey. You've violated that, and so I hope Animate reinstates it. <font color=\\\"blue\\\">\nAniMate: IMO, the only reason this latest round of Merkey related editing occurred is because Merkey, or someone with an IP in his area, added tags to accounts accusing them of being Pfagerburg's socks. If he had gone after Merkey's edits apropos of nothing, yes I would block. However, responding to sock allegations isn't unreasonable. I'm not going to reblock. <font face=\\\"Herculanum\\\" color=\\\"black\\\">\nSlimVirgin: Pfagerburg said above that he started the latest round when he tagged what he thought was a Merkey sock on September 7, then the next day posted to have an article deleted that he thought Merkey wrote. [http:\\\/\\\/en.wikipedia.org\\\/w\\\/index.php?title=Special:Undelete&target=MDB+%28Linux%29&timestamp=20100908022130&diff=prev] That's not what people do if they don't want to have anything to do with someone. Animate, this issue was settled. He had been indefinitely blocked and was unblocked ''on the understanding that he was here to edit Wikipedia''. He hasn't done that. What is the point of laying down conditions then ignoring them? The Pfagerburg account is one that has been used almost exclusively in pursuit of a named person for almost four years. I don't understand why any admin would feel that was an appropriate use of Wikipedia. <font color=\\\"blue\\\">\nAniMate: The article that set this off was created by the user name PaulFagburg. I see [[Wikipedia:Username_policy#Real_names|impersonation]], [[WP:NPA|homophobic slurs]], and [[WP:SOCK|socking]]. If this is the account that started it, they went after Pfagerburg first. No, I will not block for this, and frankly I don't see why any admin would consider the actions of the user behind PaulFagburg and the various other IPs an acceptable use of Wikipedia. <font face=\\\"Herculanum\\\" color=\\\"black\\\">\nSlimVirgin: You have the chronology confused. That account was created on September 20, ''after'' Pfagerburg had resumed hostilities. And anyway that's missing the point and playing his game; two wrongs don't make a right.

I did not refer to every type of work you do, obviously, and was simply pointing out that you have done a lot of good work creating more off-beat articles. I'm not familiar with your every contribution, but your user page shows that you like to write on semi-quirky food-related topics and that you do a lot of it&mdash;pointing that out was not meant as a slight or minimization in any way. The flip side to that was that you run into a lot of trouble in political areas, and I think most readers would see that I was contrasting what I see as a problematic editing pattern (relating to politics) with a very constructive one (creating new articles in one topic area). I know you make contributions all over the place and I never said otherwise.

That is grossly inaccurate. I make exceptional contributions across a wide swath of articles including MANY political subjects where editing is often difficult and contentious. If editors were encouraged to focus on article content and sourcing issues, instead of ad hominem attacks we could get a great deal more done. Your statement plays into the character assasinations and pigeon holing. As you haven't amended or clarified it we're not done.

","146411":"MelanieN: Based on this, I believe that significant reviews on publication are sufficient to establish notability in the opinion of most editors, and furthermore that significant reviews on publication are exactly what [[WP:NB]] has in mind when it calls for \\\"multiple, non-trivial published works whose sources are independent of the book itself.\\\" I think your interpretation is novel - not an approach I have ever seen before, or found in a search of past discussions. So if you want to apply it you should probably first look for consensus at [[Wikipedia talk:Notability (books)]]. If you want to start a discussion there, feel free to copy our conversation over there as a start. In any case, thanks for a stimulating discussion! --\nMelanieN: P.S. Another thing that occurs to me: if we adopted your rule that contemporary reviews don't count, it would completely preclude us from covering ANY new books, because we would be required to wait a few years to determine if the book turned out to be notable or not. --\nFT2: Thinking about these would probably help us (as a community) to agree on principles in this area, and clarify [[WP:NB]] for future. \nMelanieN: ## Is \\\"significant publication review coverage\\\" enough by itself to make a book notable? ## Yes, I think it is. And IMO [[WP:NB]] already says that it is. But if you want to clarify that, the relevant talk page would be the appropriate place to try to do it. Please let me know if you do start a discussion there. --\nMelanieN: P.S. What is your response to my comment that according to this criterion you are proposing, recently published books could never (or hardly ever) be listed? Is that what you have in mind, or am I distorting your intention? --\nMelanieN: P.S. Again: the reason I included the past AFD closes is to show that up to now, reviews on publication have been accepted by consensus as evidence of notability. Wikipedia operates by consensus, so if you want to impose this additional requirement, you will have to find others who agree with you, or convince them to agree with you. --\nFT2: As you rightly say, we work on consensus. I honestly don't mind if [[WP:NB]] is amended to say \\\"review coverage alone is sufficient\\\" or is sufficient in some cases (which?), or is usually insufficient. I want to clarify the issues as best we can between us though, and if necessary then get eyeballs and become clearer one way or another how it's viewed by the wider community. \nMelanieN: I don't pretend to know anything about the bands\\\/musician criteria here; that's not my thing. But I note that the wording at [[WP:BAND]] is identical to the wording at [[WP:NB]] and so I would assume that mainstream reviews of the band in major sources would qualify it, yes. The same identical wording also applies to [[WP:WEB]]. The fact is that new bands and new websites don't usually get written up in major reliable source publications without good reason. (If a brand new band that has never charted, gets major reviews, it is almost certainly because it IS notable for some reason.) <br> From your \\\"answer-a-question-with-question\\\" response, do I understand you to be confirming that, indeed, newly published books (and websites and musical groups) should not have Wikipedia articles, no matter how many substantial reviews they get? <br> We are talking in circles here. You are trying to apply this new criterion of yours to an increasing number of categories, all of which do seem to currently allow major reviews in mainstream reliable sources as evidence of notability. I accept that as the status quo and I don't think the criteria need to be amended, because I think the admissibility of reviews is clear enough as the guidelines stand.. --\nFT2: My reading of policies and guidelines is to be very wary of \\\"on release\\\" reviews of commercial offerings, which may not show any kind of enduring significance (\\\"Wikipedia is an encyclopedia\\\"). Many users mistake or equate \\\"significant coverage\\\" for \\\"encyclopedic topic\\\", but verifiability, including verified or brief widespread coverage, isn't always going to be the same as encyclopedic significance or notability (as repeatedly noted in discussions). For the sake of future AFDs I'd like to be clearer on the extent to which we take publication or release coverage of commercial or media products as evidence of encyclopedic significance. I feel fairly strongly that we should obtain views and see what consensus is, and my personal view is that publication coverage should be taken very warily if it's the sole evidence. That said, I don't feel hugely strongly on the specific decision such a discussion should reach, my concern is more that we probably should discuss it. Whichever side consensus ends up on is fine preovided it's had careful thought and results in clarity of the area. \nMelanieN: Be my guest. I think you and I understand each other's position pretty well by now and further discussion here would just be repetitious. Will you incorporate our discussion into your proposal to amend the guideline, or start fresh? BTW since you seem to feel the same criteria apply to music and to web pages (and maybe other areas), do you intend to start a discussion on those talk pages too? Because if [[WP:NB]] is amended, all the other pages that have identical wording should be amended as well.  --","169121":"Murderbike: Hey there, is there a way to get the infobox generator to do one for a TR or MPS, or do I need to do it manually?

That would be easier to do, and would probably make more sense for someone reading the list.  --\nMurderbike: Actually, I was thinking of an infobox like the one at [[Religious Structures of Woodward Ave. TR]].

Sorry, I don't know the answer. My last edit removing the \\\"under construction\\\" template saved without the blue screen, but it was slow. One way to lighten up the article is to abandon some reference templates - for example, strip all non-pdf cite web and site news to bare url, and run reflinks with an option not to use templates. \nJimWae: It must have been the construction template.

We have already discussed mediation\\\/closure of this phase, and have Newyorkbrad and WJBScribe lined up to do this (and actually discussed among ourselves about who would do this). We really do not need further mediation here. I would explain further, but as I said, this is going way too fast, and needs to be considered much more carefully. So for now I would appreciate if you put this on hold, rather than offering (although appreciated) to mediate this yourself. I really need some time to collect my thoughts. You may also be interested in [[User_talk:Newyorkbrad#Wikipedia:Pending_changes.2FRequest_for_Comment_February_2011|this discussion]] which Beeblebrox neglected to mention, where we discussed who would close the request (this was also previously discussed at the RfC), and where I, and other opposition, are compared to terrorists, something Beeblebrox apparently has considered in the past, and appears to be what prompted him to open the request. Sorry for the rushed comment, as I say I really need time to collect my thoughts, you guys are moving way too fast. Best, - \nNicholasTurnbull: Thanks for your thoughts, Kingpin13. Please don't worry. I will investigate the dynamics of the RfC fully as this progresses and if it does indeed transpire that no further mediation is necessary (and the requesting parties have specified this), it will be either held or closed as such. However, I should say that the requesting individuals for the Mediation Cabal case are permitted to request the Mediation Cabal to look into mediating it; but please, don't be concerned this means I am instantly assuming a general agreement from RfC participants to have the Mediation Cabal mediate. If there is no consensus for mediation it will, as I said, be closed as such, or else the mediation will be confined to being between the parties that wish to mediate. Nobody is forced to participate in the Mediation Cabal process. --\nKingpin13: Thank you for the cross post, however, I have removed it for now, as I wish to have absolutely nothing to do with this pathetic attempt to circulate the consensus we ''already established'' on the RfC talk page about how we would close this RfC. This request is a display of certain users acting on a whim and completely ignoring what we already discussed and decided on, instead imposing their own personal views on what the object of the RfC is. Obviously I am still rather flustered about this, I suppose I'm not at my best composure after being accused of holding hostages and being likened to a terrorist. I am upset that you plan to plough on with this, as I said I do not think that is the best way forward. Instead it should be put on hold ''until'' you have a clearer understanding of the dynamics of this case, which I do not feel you currently grasp, as evidenced by your approach to this. I appreciate that you feel you should be able to \\\"learn on the job\\\" as it were, but I am of the strong opinion that this will result in conflict with the already agreed upon course. Please ''please please'' place this on hold until you have properly reviewed if it actually needs further mediation (which I assure you it does not, and will simply lead to more harm being done) - \nNicholasTurnbull: I'm sort of between a rock and a hard place with this. The trouble is, the Mediation Cabal doesn't have a rule (unlike the MedCom) that says that all participants must sign agreement to mediation; therefore, I can't just put it on hold based on your objection to the request. The parties who have communicated on the page do have a right to have their case considered by a mediator and discussed. Arguably, also, it is not in fact up to me as a mediator to understand the dynamics of the case; it is up to the parties to discuss it amongst themselves, albeit in a structured (or semi-structured) fashion that produces more driving force than heat. I really do appreciate your concern and for all I know you may be right, but it would be remiss of me to suddenly put what appears to be an urgent request for assistance on hold simply because of your misgivings. If it is apparent that there is no mediation work to be done, or it would be harmful, I will terminate the mediation. --\nNicholasTurnbull: Alright, how about a compromise. I will post on the MedCab page to say that a view has been put forward that consensus has already been reached as per the talk page for the subsequent actions to take on the RfC, and state that until this has been investigated fully the mediation will be kept open, but no direct involvement with the RfC talk page should occur nor any presentation of proposals for action to take on the RfC. --\nKingpin13: That would be very much appreciated, as I say the problem here is that everything is going way too fast. Yes, I agree entirely with your point that they \\\"have a right to have their case considered by a mediator,\\\" however, this particular case is full of controversy, and - no offence to you - an arbitrarily selected user mediating is not going to make the cut. It is of extreme importance to me that it is mediated in such a way that all participants agree on via consensus. This mediation request did not reflect the wishes or feeling of the participants. Newyorkbrad seemed perfect for this, indeed even Beeblebrox supported having him close the RfC. I feel that we should leave the mediation\\\/closure up to him. Best, - \nCycloneGU: Now, my intent was not to compare 200 or more users to a group of terrorists (I did accidentally use that word at first, that's what is crossed out as withdrawn).  However, Kingpin made a block threat calling it a personal attack.  I did have initial doubts about posting that comment, but decided to [[WP:BEBOLD|be bold]] and make the observation.  [[User:Beeblebrox|Beeblebrox]] agreed with my observation, and I think that is why the mediation appeared.  I'll await your further determination on what to do with it, and if it's determined unnecessary, I will accept your judgment.  \nNicholasTurnbull: Perhaps, in which case, there may be a case to be made for this going to [[WP:RFM]] if it's mediated at all by a process rather than the MedCab. (The only trouble with that is, ironically, you'd probably get me again.) But, are you aware that it is general Wikipedia precedent that users cannot select their mediators (it is specifically in the mediation policy that they can't), no more they can select the members of the ArbCom who decide their case? If there is a contingent of editors who wish to apply to one of the [[WP:DR]] processes on their own steam aside from a page discussion, they aren't doing anything wrong to request dispute resolution. --\nKingpin13: {{ec}}Originally the quote read \\\"terrorist group\\\" as oppose to \\\"hostage situation\\\". CycloneGU did indeed strike this, saying at the same time as doing so that he stood by his analogy (which consisted of describing a situation wherein a person is blackmailing and threatening to murder (see the quote above) and using that as a way to describe the opposition). Naturally being compared with a terrorist (or alternatively, if that word was a \\\"mistake,\\\" being compared to a person who blackmails and threatens murder (i.e. a terrorist)) was taken by me as an attack. And, as CycloneGU says (and I already stated), it does indeed appear that the mediation request was prompted by the discussion there, where Beeblebrox also agreed with CycloneGU's pre-struck comment about likening the opposition to terrorists. How or if this personal attack justifies the request, I am unclear on. - ","48252":"Peterlewis: I didn't blank the page on friction because a vandal had changed the title to Our guide to friction.

However, due to political issues, the Iraqi government claimed that there were only 136,000 Turks. Furthermore, a year later they admitted that the '''very same census''' actually counted 567,000 Turkmen (more than 400% from the previous year\\u2019s claim). The census itself was published in '''1959'''. Thus, the published census says that there was 567,000 Iraqi Turkmen in 1957 not 136,800.\nTurco85: If we all know that the '136,800' figure was corrupt [as all the sources show], and we have sources which clearly state that the Iraqi government admitted that the population was actually 567,000, why on earth should we place a corrupt number in the info box?

It was only on January 23, 2011 that '''Paralympiakos''' reverted the changes without discussing them before doing it, which by the way [http:\\\/\\\/en.wikipedia.org\\\/w\\\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:WikiProject_Mixed_martial_arts&diff=409813482&oldid=409597801 he did again]. \nL'Aquatique: I just noticed that, it was sort of a ways up the talk page so I didn't see it before. I warned [[User:Paralympiakos]] about edit warring, so if the issue continues to persist please let me know and I can intervene further. As far as I can tell from your discussion, this is a MOS issue, yes? \nJfgslo: Correct, mainly with capitalization ([[MOS:CAPS]]) and to a lesser degree with flag icons ([[MOS:ICON]]). Since it's an style issue, most editors appear to simply ignore the discussion and the Manual of Styles. Any suggestion to get more editors involved in this discussion? \nJfgslo: By the way, I mentioned the revert that '''Paralympiakos''' did because I didn't notice the warning in his talk page since it was removed. I thought you had forgotten to put it or that it was placed before the revert. \nL'Aquatique: In any case, you have a few options for getting more minds involved. I would start with a post on the [[WP:MOS|MOS]] talk page. We also have a [[WP:3|third opinion]] mechanism that brings an uninvolved editor into the arena, but that is essentially the purpose I am serving for you here, so you may not want to go down that route. You could also try opening a [[WP:RFC|request for comment]], but try the MOS talk page first because this seems like a pretty open and shut dealio. Hope that helps, let me know if there's anything else I can assist with. \nJfgslo: It's been already 3 days since I requested help at [[WT:MOS]] and there have been no responses so far. Even '''Paralympiakos''' has commented nothing on the issue, only leaving me a message in my talk page to stop correcting capitalization because it looks ugly. So far, only [[User:LOL|LOL]] has added something to the discussion. I still want to revert the changes made by '''Paralympiakos''' since he did not give solid arguments for doing it and I firmly believe that the way it is right now, [[WP:MMA]] is contradicting [[WP:MOS]], [[MOS:CAPS]] and [[MOS:ICON]] and wasting bandwidth unnecessarily, but I believe that if I make changes he will simply revert them back without discussing in the talk page of the project. What do you suggest that I do now? Do I wait, do I request help at [[MOS:CAPS]] and [[MOS:ICON]] or something else? \nL'Aquatique: I would make the change one more time, and if he reverts it open a [[WP:RFC|request for comment]] to bring more eyes to the subject. Also, make sure to mention [[WP:MOS|the MOS]] in your edit summary and keep it really low-key. If you open the RfC, avoid any sort of blame placing and word it something like, \\\"there's a dispute between several editors over interpretation of the Manual of Style.\\\"  \nJfgslo: I have followed your advice. I have once again [http:\\\/\\\/en.wikipedia.org\\\/w\\\/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AWikiProject_Mixed_martial_arts&action=historysubmit&diff=410676899&oldid=409855759 changed the text of that section]. Now I'll wait to see if it's reverted again. \nJfgslo: I have a request. Could you comment on [[WT:MMA#MMA record table problems]] in response to '''Paralympiakos'''' most recent comment? I'm afraid that it might seem too personal if only I responded to him, since he, in my opinion, gave no valid reason and seems to simply want to ignore every guideline that he doesn't like.

The issue I discussed above is a reflection of the same behavior. &mdash;&nbsp;Carl <small>(\nCokaban: Philogo, the problem with the empty domain is not really a ''problem'', it is more like an inconvenience of having always to consider this case separately, because the reasoning of the sort \\\"let ''x'' be an arbitrary element of the domain...\\\" will no longer work.

I have asked her to provide specifics.  I am disappointed that her prior support for me, and now opposition, appears to be unconnected to anything related to articles.  Fundamentally, we are here to write articles.  Every decision I make resolves down to the question of ''how will this affect the articles.''  Many during this election have said that they can't figure me out.  That's because there's nothing to figure.  Over time I have learned to reject all ideas of alliances, loyalties, animosities, or voting blocks.  Instead, I base decisions on what will be best for the articles. One day I may support somebody in one matter, and the next day I might oppose them in a different one.  If this upsets some people, so be it. \nJehochman: It's very bad when people get so overheated that they cannot even talk to one another. I am sad that it came to this, and I have withdrawn from the election as a result. \nOrderinchaos: Likewise I do not believe in alliances or loyalties - people earn my support through merit, even if they are friends, and I'm not averse to agreeing with an adversary if they are right, and have done so on at least two occasions. At times I know that I have upset friends through opposing them on here on various issues (sometimes even getting blocked on MSN for it), but if I strongly believe that they are wrong and that there's a wider principle involved, I would not be doing my duty to my own conscience (or to the project, arguably, as it voted for me to be an admin and hence expects me to do such things) if I did not act. People will obviously disagree about right and wrong, each person has their own barometer for what issues are critical and which can be left, etc. Certainly at this end I have not felt overheated - stunned, yes, in some ways disappointed, yes, but I've felt relatively little intense emotion about anything to do with Wikipedia for quite a while now. \nJehochman: Let's talk about things.  I recognize that I acted out of frustration and should not have posted my remark to Sarah's talk page.  I'd really like to understand why she mistrusts me.

Hopefully she'll let me know some day.  I've heard through the grape vine about some rumors that were circulated about me.  This leads me to believe that some folks may have heard stuff and made judgments without asking me.  Hopefully the word will get out that I am approachable and do not mind specific criticism.

Thank you. \nPaul August: Thanks Bish, that means a lot to me that you think so. I hope others agree. I don't know exactly what I think should come of all this, but I thought it was important to try and construct as complete a record as possible of these events. I took no joy from sifting through all these things, but I have to say that Fil's parting message was the inspiration and impetuous for my doing this. \nFunc: Wow, that was a lot of good work, Paul.

Especially when it comes to ''doing any good''. But thanks for your thinking so. I have to admit, as I said to Bish on her talk page, I've been feeling a bit like a lone voice in the wilderness. I'd be interested in other's views on these matters, so I could tell whether I'm just being a ninny or not. Anyway I so wanted ''someone'' to see and appreciate my little attempt at levity.

I agree with Func that Paul did good work here. It is a pity that the case was closed in the meantime. I'm sorry to say that the way the ArbCom handled the matter left me with a bitter aftertaste: negotiating with Ed about a suitable \\\"punishment\\\" and closing the case ''without comment on Ed's actions'' smack too much of shady back room dealing to me. Nevertheless, I still have huge respect for the ArbCom members for taking on what is undoubtedly the worst task on Wikipedia, and for me, the Committee clearly has the greatest authority on Wikipedia matters of all persons and entities, even when I don't agree with its judgements. -- ","39259":"Zero0000: Hi, I hope you don't mind my posts on your Sources page.

I was working on the [[artemisinin]] article and noticed that your structure [[File:Artemisinin skeletal.svg|100px]] differs from [[File:Artemisinin.svg|100px]]; the latter is confirmed in other sources, e.g. [http:\\\/\\\/books.google.com\\\/books?id=Zz3XIfDZDw0C&lpg=PA360&dq=artemisinin&pg=PA360#v=onepage&q=artemisinin&f=false] and [http:\\\/\\\/books.google.com\\\/books?id=MSfOKBWv_sIC&lpg=PA1&dq=artemisinin&pg=PA2#v=onepage&q=artemisinin&f=false]. Do you think we should delete your structure so as not to confuse other users of Commons? Cheers, \nFvasconcellos: Hi there! Both structures actually represent the exact same molecule\\u2014they are simply in different orientations. Feel free to use Luk\\xe1\\u0161's in the article, but I will update mine anyway, because it is compliant with [[WP:CSDG]] (unlike [[:File:Artemisinin.svg]]). Best wishes, \nAxelBoldt: In your structure, the peroxide bridge and the nearby methyl group are shown on the same side of the rings' plane, while in the other structures they are on opposite sides. Also, in your structure only one leg of the bridge points away from the plane while the other seems flat. Are these not important? \nFvasconcellos: No, that was a poor representation (having the wedge bond on only one leg), which really does suggest that the bridge is \\\"staggered\\\", although the stereochemistry was correct (and remains the same). The peroxide bridge pointing up vs. down is not an error. In my original structure, which I have since corrected and now matches Luk\\xe1\\u0161's in orientation, the entire molecule was flipped \\\"upside down\\\", so naturally the peroxide bridge would appear to be on a plane above rather than below the backbone of the structure. \nAxelBoldt: I understand that your original structure was flipped and that therefore the bridge was above rather than below, which is fine. However your methyl group at the base of the bridge was also above, and I think it should have been below. In any event, that has now been corrected. There's only one difference left between your structure and the structures in the books: the books show one bond of the lactone ring as a wedge going inside, whereas in your structure the lactone ring is shown to be flat. I don't know whether that makes a difference or not. \nFvasconcellos: Actually, that does make a difference; this structure (the one in the books, showing one bond of the lactone as a wedge) is not compliant with IUPAC rules\\u2014and is probably inaccurate. See page 300 of [http:\\\/\\\/vsites.unb.br\\\/iq\\\/litmo\\\/qui_med\\\/variacoes_modernas_farmacos\\\/structure_activity_relationships_antimalaria_agent_artemisinin.pdf this article] for a 3D model of the crystal structure of artemisinin, showing its absolute configuration: the D ring is flat. (If we wanted to be fully compliant with IUPAC rules for representation of stereochemistry, the methyl group adjacent to the peroxide bridge should not be shown as a wedge either. See [http:\\\/\\\/www.rsc.org\\\/Education\\\/EiC\\\/issues\\\/2006July\\\/Artemisinin.asp this article] for the most accurate structural formulae of artemisinin I have found so far.)

Officially, your RfA is still open and is schedule to run until 08:10, 8 August 2010.

Once people see that you are knowledgeable in those area's you will breeze trough the next RFA. Or alternatively you might conclude that you don't like the maintenance work, and that you prefer writing article's. Either way, keep in mind that an admin is simply a Wikipedian-style cleaner with a bucket on his head, a mop in his hand and some sponge's under his soles. I know it sounds comical, but it is really quite accurate (In a figurative way). An admin is in no way more important or valuable then any other Wikipedian. \nBwrs: Sorry to see your RFA fail.
