If the [[Atlantic Ocean]] can have geocoordinates, why can't congressional districts, telephone area codes, and ancient lakes? It's not like the case with storms because those other things have definite agreed upon physical locations.--&mdash;\nPi.1415926535: With the Atlantic, the coordinates make it meaningful - any mapping site will show the ocean. A map is meaningful for congressional districts, area codes, and lakes; geocoordinates that point to a random location inside such things which are invisible on mass maps like Google Maps are not useful for those cases. \nElipongo: I still do not understand the logic of your point. What differentiates a \\\"random point\\\" in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] from one in [[Area code 203]] or [[Connecticut]] for that matter? If it's a scaling issue, that's why there's a parameter for that in the template. Our mission isn't to be a supplier of content to Google Maps, so a coordinate's lack of usefulness in their Wikipedia layer hardly seems relevent to me. --&mdash;\n7: Putting a coord on Atlantic Ocean is not especially useful, but its at the same time at least it is not confusing because the boundaries are clearly visible on map or satellite which identify item.  However, area codes don't follow such strict boundries.  Within CT there 203, 457, and 860.  There are no clear maps which would define where one starts and one ends because after CT expanded from just 203 people who needed new phone numbers got new codes.  I know people with one house with two lines, both of which have different area codes indicating the age at which they got the numbers, not the geographical location.  Lastly, and this is a stretch (I agree), but VOIP has essentially made area codes irrelevant.  My number follows me around the world with Vonage and Skype.  Putting a coordinate on an article like this implies a false precision, regardless of how far out the map layer is zoomed.  \nElipongo: The fact that I've retained the 860 phone number on my cellphone since I've moved to NYC does not change the fact that, for the time being at least, that number traces back to a specific region of Connecticut. Area code borders are very distinct, just ask the residents of [[Marble Hill, Manhattan]] about having to switch their area code from 212 to 718 despite the neighborhood being politically part of Manhattan, just not physically. Yes the borders of congressional districts and area codes are changed sometimes, but the same can be said for parks, towns, cities, and nations! The point of the coord template is so that users can click it and get an idea of where in the world something is. Just because you know generally where the 860 area code is doesn't mean someone from California or Sri Lanka does.--&mdash;\n7: It appears that we disagree.

The reason for having double  title is that this article is a copy\\\/paste about a group Thothaal. All the details are in the discussion section. I have suggested to change the title to \\\"Thathal\\\", because there isn\\xb4t any clan with Thathaal or Thothaal name. But we have four villages named \\\"Thathal\\\" in Pakistan and India. There are some who called themselve \\\"Thothal\\\". I was planning to explain this in the article. Moreover some from this calim to be [[Jatt]] while other claim to be [[Rajput]]. A lot needs to be deleted from this article because those section under the titles of \\\"History\\\" are completely unsourced, unreferenced and completely fabricated. I have given the link in the discussion section to the site where this article was copied from. All the objections about the article are also in the discussion area. Would you mind to change the title of the article to \\\"Thathal\\\", because this has to come there after sometime. There is already two \\\"Move tags\\\" in the discussion section. One of the tag is more than ten days old. I put a new tag today, just to make sure that if somebody got late and did not respond in a week, then he should have the chance. But since you are an admin, and your opinion carry more weight. Can you please change the title to \\\"Thathal\\\" ( NOT \\\" Thathaal). Shukria (thanks) in advance. Regards\nMar4d: Thank you for your message. First of all, I am not an admin as you have mentioned above; also, I am not very knowledgable on the topic.  What I do know is that the current title did not conform to Wikipedia's naming conventions and that's why it was changed temporarily. If you do feel the new title is not appropriate, you may just need to wait until an admin reads your move request on the talk page. As has been said before, the title should consist of only one name, while others can be redirects. \nJogibaba: Hi Mar4d, thanks for the reply, Possibly you might have noticed that I have written a lot about the fabrication of this article.

This article was about \\\"Thothaal\\\" and not \\\"Thathaal\\\", The person who pasted this article here on wikipedia is Atwozee, (he is currently banned for 2 weeks). I have challanged the autenticity of the article with all the proof. But instead of coming to discussion Atwozee is coming with such remarks about me  \\\"Actually Jogibaba wants to upset this page because he has some personal anger on thathaals, the real story is this \\\"A thathaal fucked his sister wildly so he is taking revenge. Bloody Bastard, son of bitch\\\". Lolz!!!\\\" this he has written while remaining unlogged (Revision as of 23:10, 17 September 2010 (edit), later he wrote on his page \\\"Jogibaba wants to delete this page from wikipedia so block this kind of users on this page, he is mother sucker and even do not know about his real father name, the name mentioned on his birth certificate have no proof, kindly ask from his mother.\\\"( this is still there on his page.)

I need a help from an admin from asian section to sort this matter. Admins from English section does not know so much about this.

My problem with this infobox was the way that it puts an emphasis on commanders, numbers and other things, an emphasis that is not found in the book. Using infoboxes initially designed for real battles has never made much sense for me as far as fictional battles go. It turns a literary article into a [[Top Trumps]] card game. Also, infoboxes should, in my view, only summarise information found in the article - they are an alternative way to access the information, and all the information in the infobox should be presented as prose as well.

[http:\\\/\\\/www.musikpaatvaers.dk\\\/willumsen.6 Here] there is a painting by Willumsen which seems to have been inspired by a dream Carl Nielsen had, I don't know if it is too far fetched but it will certainly add colour and some variation.

Maybe it is also worth mentioning the [http:\\\/\\\/www.facebook.com\\\/pages\\\/Carl-Nielsen-International-Music-Competition-Festival\\\/159540598314 Carl Nielsen International Music Competition]] and the Carl Nielsen Prize.

It might also be interesting to expand on CN interest in Scaninavia, the USA, UK, France, Germany, etc. - \nIpigott: As an addendum to the above, I have spent some time analysing all the info about current concerts from the Carl Nielsen Society. I have added a list of the most popular pieces to the CN article but I was rather surprised to see that although all the symphonies are on the agenda, only two of the string quartets came up. There were one or two performances of the violin and flute concertos (done), a few Serenada invanos (needs to be done), a couple of Faroes Fantasies (to be done) and one or two performances of At the Bier of a Young Artist (??). There were also a couple of performances of Pan and Syrinx and one of the organ piece Commotio (should be included). In DK, there were also performances of Violin Sonata No. 2 and of Springtime in (on?) Funen.

Another thing: Are there cases where you invented the term \\\"x prime\\\" for an \\\"x number\\\" which is prime, when others have never used the name \\\"x prime\\\". Mathematicians have done the same for many specific x, but I don't think Wikipedia should introduce a name like \\\"x prime\\\" on its own, even if no article is created about it. For example, [[list of prime numbers]] contains \\\"McNugget primes\\\" which only has Google hits to Wikipedia and clones. It's obvious from [[McNugget number]] that all primes above 12 are \\\"McNugget primes\\\", so why make a name for it or even discuss such primes? Google also only has Wikipedia and clone hits on \\\"Wedderburn-Etherington primes\\\" and possibly others. Hv asked for references on the name \\\"Dirichlet prime\\\".

It's cohorts not \\\"coharts\\\". Secondly, I am not an Afrocentrist and I am not pushing an agenda. I do have an interest in race and history (I am an Egalitarian\\\/anti-racist). I picked up an interest in the race of the Ancient Egyptians through a discussion with racists online about race and human accomplishment. I haven't attempted to prove one way or another what race the Ancient Egyptians were. I have posted sources relevant to the article and consistent with the theme of reporting on the history of the controversy. For instance in the edit that Ice Cold Beer cited I extended the King Tut section of the article with more relevant information along with comments by experts on the science behind the reconstruction. Are my citations not relevant to reporting on the history of the controversy? They clearly are. What the current version does is attempt to limit the scope of the article and infact push an Anti-Afrocentric POV on the controversy which is anti-intellectual and historically inaccurate. The broad scope of the article detailing the history of the controversy (origins of the debate section) from the 18th century to the present is the correct account. We can talk about the material within the article. Some of which can be removed and some sections need improvement but we need to return to the broad scope, not the dishonest version that is up at the present. Let's dispense with the personal attacks and resume civil discourse.

I'd forgotten about my follow-up comment above (dated 04:25, 16 December 2009 (UTC)), but it's as true today as it was then. Ottava simply can't (or hasn't demonstrated a way to, at least) effectively contribute to the English Wikipedia. Thousands of people have found ways to edit here without incident; several thousands more [[Special:Log\\\/block|have not]]. I don't see this as a strike against Ottava necessarily, but I do see it as the reality.

There were certainly strongly positive aspects to my collaboration with Ottava when he was active (anything negative I will let rest among the bygones), and I would welcome him back ''if and only if'' he (1) formally requests his unbanning according to whatever official procedures there are, and (2) the kinds of restrictions suggested above by Moni, iridescent, and others are applied.

I find this statement most perplexing and perceive it as being demonstrably false. Perhaps you meant to say something else? Like Ottava hasn't exhibited a consistent attitude conducive to collaboration? Simply writing an article to FA standards exhibits the ability to contribute effectively to English Wikipedia. What's your definition of contributing effectively? --\nMZMcBride: Apologies, that sentence is really ambiguous. I meant \\\"effectively contribute\\\" in the sense that he hasn't been able to do so without getting himself banned. It isn't a matter of the quality of his content contributions at all. But there is a social component here. We have a lot of editors who aren't the most social people, but who are able to contribute content without making a fuss. Ottava clearly isn't one of them. --\nGatoclass: '''Conditional support''' - I was always of the opinion that the original ban was unduly harsh, but if there is to be a move to reinstate Ottava's editing privileges, they must come with clear conditions. One condition I would want to see is to have Ottava banned from any discussions that do not directly concern article content, as he has shown far too much interest in wikidramas and meta-discussions that do not concern him in the past. I would also like to see the bar lowered for blocks, so that admins can block him for brief periods (of, say, up to a week) when he starts filibustering or making personal attacks. \nLing.Nut: +S, perhaps conditionally. It would be nice to see one of these rehabilitation movement thingies actually work. However, if conditions are laid on the unban, I strongly support the idea that OR should follow the program (or whatever ya wanna call it), since Wikipedia as a community deserves to be listened to at least as much as any individual Wikipedian. Whatever the hell that means. &bull;&nbsp;\nYomangani: '''Oppose'''. I can't be arsed to read the small print of the (no-doubt interminable) Arbcom case, but presumably if he serves out his full ban he can return unrestricted. If so, why would he want to return early and put up with months of cap-in-hand-begging-your-pardon-your-worship when it appears that he has no problem contributing to the encyclopedia from afar? If he is still the same intractable hornet that the community found so unbearable previously, then why imagine that he will pay attention to any conditions imposed? If he has reformed, then why would any conditions be necessary? Lift the ban unconditionally and deal with him if he starts playing up, the same as with any other user; Arbcom has already shown it has no problem with banning him should he become even slightly irksome. (This is mind-reading of course, he may be only too keen to return under the cosh).\nGatoclass: Allowing him back with no restrictions will eventually just lead to another ban in my opinion. IMO it would be better to let him back with some restrictions and see how that works out. \nYomangani: Either he is reformed or he is not. If he is reformed there is not a problem. If he is unreformed then your choice is have him kick against his restrictions or against the wider system. Both eventually lead to a ban. Restrictions only have the advantage of belittling him. \nIridescent: For the benefit of those who aren't aware, [[Wikipedia:Arbitration\\\/Requests\\\/Case\\\/Mattisse\\\/Monitoring|there ''is'' a precedent]] for \\\"return under strictly controlled conditions\\\". Yes, that particular case didn't work out too well, but the structures are there.&nbsp;\\u2013&nbsp;<font color=\\\"#E45E05\\\">\nMoni3: \\\"Didn't work out too well\\\" in English is \\\"zOMG! spectacular FAILBOAT!!1!\\\" and I'm aware that I was involved in that case and none too happy with how it was carried out. I think it might have worked out well if several aspects of the case were different. I understand where Yomangani is coming from, however. It's a matter of economics: how much time does the community, and really, a handful of admins, want to spend watching and attempting to curtail the nutty behavior of one prolific content editor? How much does that content editor want to participate in Wikipedia? I think it's worth trying out for a bit. If it fails, it fails. --\nYomangani: Yes, but the time the community (or those admins) spends trying to enforce the restrictions is the same or more than would be spent curtailing other unacceptable behaviour. Most of the Matisse mentorship revolved around determining restrictions, proper forms for raising issues, limits of responsibilities, requests for clarifications etc. etc. There were probably only a handful of incidents in those months and reams of arguing. It's a wikilawyer's paradise. The restrictions are already in place - they are the same restrictions that all other editors face. \nLing.Nut: Actually, I see Yomangan(i)'s point: we cannot control the behavior of others, despite our best wishes. <s>If there is any<\\\/s>One value in restrictions <s>at all, it<\\\/s> is a symbolic one: that the editor is willing to be bound to them is a show of good faith. Etc. Another is the hope that such restrictions lead a person to a new self-awareness etc. But... if the ban hasn't already done that, will the restrictions? I give up. Just make sure I'm not on any d*mn mentor list. Over and out. &bull;&nbsp;\nCool Hand Luke: Ottava can write his articles wherever he wants. From my perspective, expressly allowing intermediaries to imports his articles from off-site is a win-win for the project as we get his good works without his bad behavior. I wish this status quo was expressly endorsed by ArbCom. (Note: I'm recused on the Ottava on ArbCom, and I'm happy to once again find myself in agreement with MZMcBride.) \nElen of the Roads: I don't either - just wanted to make that clear.  But I bet someone suggests it for real. --\nGatoclass: In a sense, Ottava is ''already'' \\\"editing with restrictions\\\", since he's still making contributions that are just being posted by his buddies. So some restrictions really ''do'' work. I do think though that the current de facto \\\"system\\\" is far from ideal and that we'd be better to let him back with some clear restrictions on where he is and isn't allowed to post in order to limit his potential for disruption. If in addition, we say, added a condition that he is not permitted to appeal a ban of a week or less, he might be sufficiently defanged to be considered a net asset. \nTony1: '''<s>Support''', but only with high expectations of a fresh approach to avoiding drama.

I said it before and say it again: the idea of mentors who are selected because \\\"they have tangled with this person before and will drop the hammer\\\" is moonbats at best, and sneaky\\\/vindictive at worst. The idea of a friend being a mentor is just a really good way to break the mentor's heart and cause burnout. The mentor would have to have '''no''' relationship to the telemachus, can't be too kindhearted, but can't be too hangin' judge either. The mentor must deal with shit. It's a thankless task and a burnout generator. &bull;&nbsp;\nSlimVirgin: The problem with the mentoring system is that the mentors often end up as advocates, because relationships form and empathy deepens. That's why, as Tony said, it would have to be someone able to maintain complete independence, but in a situation like this that would place the mentor under a great deal of pressure from the mentoree, to the point where it would be unlikely to work. <font color=\\\"blue\\\">\nLing.Nut: The problem with the mentor system is that no one on the planet knows the correct things to say or do to help someone fully realize and (more importantly) fully accept that their view of reality is fundamentally and destructively incorrect, integrate this knowledge into their worldview, and emerge a more whole person...

[[\\u1f25\\u03c1\\u03c9\\u03c2]] should certainly redirect to [[Hero]] though (and does, I see).  If there is consensus for the merger, then [[Heros (disambiguation)]] should be moved to the base name, or perhaps [[Heros genus]] should, or [[Heros]] might still redirect to [[Paleo-Balkans mythology]].

In \\\"reasonably\\\" I would not include allegations of \\\"deletion\\\" or similar.  JHunterJ, I do not have the impression you have a basic grasp of this issue. The Thracian horseman is also known as \\\"the Thracian Heros\\\", viz., he is ''a'' heros, but when it comes to Thrace, he came to be \\\"''the'' Heros\\\". \\\"Heros\\\" is not originally his proper name. He is also known as the Heros Karabazmos. He is a heros, known as Karabazmos, but as his importance grew also simply as \\\"the heros\\\". Are we agreed on this? I really cannot imagine why you would argue that [[Heros]], or even [[Heros (mythology)]] should redirect to something Trace-specific, seeing that we are not Thracian Wikipedia. --\nJHunterJ: I'll leave it alone.  It appears to me that there is a difference between the Greek word transliterated heros and the English hero, and that, in the English Wikipedia, heros would indicate the user was looking for something other than hero.

As far as I can tell Njsustain met with dogged resistance from Cirt as soon as he brought out the obvious at the entry.  Then Cirt ran off to AN\\\/I where low an behold everyone focussed on the frustrated actions of Njustain and no one really bothered to look into what had made him act however it was he was acting.  The COI insinuation was over the top and uncalled for but really why on earth was this puff piece written?  It is wholly understandable that Njsustain wondered this.  Everyone assumes good faith of certain people (admins, etc.) and are quick to assume something else of those who question this.  That's not how the authority figures around here should act.  That's just my opinion.  Cheers.\nEVula: So that's how I arrived at my opinion. Could I have focused more on the reasons behind Njsustain's behavior? Yes, I could have, but I didn't. I don't consider that a failing on my part; it's just how I interpreted things. My interpretation is no less valid than your frustration that more attention wasn't given to the reasons behind Njsustain's behavior; they are merely different points of view for the same situation.

Njsustain [http:\\\/\\\/en.wikipedia.org\\\/w\\\/index.php?title=Daryl_Wine_Bar_and_Restaurant&diff=375368784&oldid=374779101 tagged] the entry with a NPOV tag and called it a \\\"puff piece\\\" in the edit summary, which again it clearly is (but we don't have to argue about that).  He also tagged it for COI, and once again I agree that the COI insinuations were not helpful at all and should not have been made like that.  Cirt [http:\\\/\\\/en.wikipedia.org\\\/w\\\/index.php?title=Daryl_Wine_Bar_and_Restaurant&diff=next&oldid=375368784 removed] both tags and immediately demanded [[WP:RS]] sources.  Is it really prudent for Cirt to remove the NPOV tag as the article creator and as someone who has been accused, perhaps falsely, of a COI? Would you advise other editors who are that intimately involved with the article to act in this way?  Did you notice this when you reviewed the situation?  Njsustain responded by actually [http:\\\/\\\/en.wikipedia.org\\\/w\\\/index.php?title=Daryl_Wine_Bar_and_Restaurant&diff=next&oldid=375376334 taking it to the talk page].  In his response he outlined the issues as he saw them: 1) Appears to be written for the purpose of promoting the restaurant, 2) Daryl is a new restaurant that does not warrant a Wikipedia article, 3) \\\"a large number of references does not necessarily make an article encyclopedic nor neutral\\\", 4) the \\\"writers\\\" have chosen only positive reviews for the article when, he claims, there are negative reviews floating around the net as well.  Are these all points that require \\\"reliable sources\\\" to be justifiably made?  Perhaps the last one, but certainly not the first three.  Demanding reliable sources is just a clever way to use the rhetoric of Wikipedia policy in order to obfuscate and it worked.  Admins authoritatively parroted Cirst asking for sources and pointing out that Njsustain hadn't supplied any as if no other issues were raised.  That's a real problem.  Seeing this, implies to me that those who bought Cirt's routine never gave Njsustain's position even a milliseconds chance.  Sure he handled himself very poorly, but someone else wrote a puff piece and managed to get you all to bully the person who caught him doing it.  That's what frustrates me here.\nNjsustain: Forgive me ladies and gentlemen for butting in, but if may point out what I see as the original source of the \\\"wikietiquette\\\" problem here, I had no idea that suggesting that there may be COI was the WP equivalent of calling out \\\"Judas!\\\" or \\\"child molester!\\\" Many people have agreed that the article smelled like there '''''may''''' have been COI, and was written as (whether or not it was) a puff piece\\\/advertisement. I simply wanted to call it to attention, and Cirt attempted to quash the debate, which, as you know from recent heated discussions on several venues, many people believe there is indeed one to be had. He did, after all, remove the POV tag as well as the \\\"blasphemous\\\" COI tag. I suspected due to the way something was written (and many others saw what was obvious to me) that it appeared to be, at least by everyday, non-WP standards, a \\\"conflict of interest,\\\" so, silly me, used the COI tag. My PhD is not in Wikipedia rules, so please forgive me if it was an abomination to have done so. But for Cirt to try to hide my suggestion to the point of accusing me of being \\\"disruptive\\\" was clearly utter assumption of bad faith. Just like Cirt's motivation for writing the article may be irrelevent to whether it should ultimately be kept, isn't it irrelevent whether I brought up additional sources to whether the article smelled like puffery? Lots of people have since said that the article seems like a puff piece, but not a single person said to any of them, \\\"Oh, yeah? Show me your sources [insert WP rules ad nauseum here].\\\" As a, let's say, casual user\\\/editor, do you really think it was appropriate to be labeled \\\"disruptive\\\" (and a \\\"dick\\\" for that matter) to ask that the matter be looked at by anyone interested? Isn't that the point of the tags? If not, obviously something has been going way over my head for the last several years, and I really don't think I'm that dense. I think a more rational explanation is that, as has been suggested by others, that people are parroting a well known administrator's accusations toward an unknown run-of-the-mill editor, and the administrative system, in this case, did not work (at least, initially) towards bringing the truth to light and to improving WP. Did I learn something? Yes. Was I utterly innocent? I would say I was innocent of malice, and guilty of naivety about the idiosyncratic meaning of some WP tags and procedures. That admins can't ultimately give me a break after my suspicions were validated (by the debates, if not by whether their outcomes ultimately agree with my initial suspicions) only continues to confirm my belief of a \\\"white wall of silence\\\" which will in the end not be positive for WP's mission, IMHO. \nNjsustain: Dear Mr.\\\/Ms. Griswaldo, I very much appreciate the time you are taking to outline the situation. While I hope my paragraph below helps to show my point of view, I think that the above paragraph (\\\"Regarding the interaction...\\\") really perfectly describes what happened. May I please ask if you could add it to the ANI noticeboard (or would permit me to do so by quoting the entire paragraph there), not necessarily because it seems to be, overall, in my favor (even with the conclusions that I behaved \\\"very poorly\\\", etc., which for the record, I don't agree with), but because I think it is a very accurate representation of how the situation played out. It also brings up for the first time by someone other than me that Cirt didn't give my position a millisecond's chance, having removed the tags in less than an hour, with no intervening comments by anyone (I assume he simply removed them when he first saw them, i.e. in a millisecond, hyperbolically, as you said). Thank you very much for your consideration. And, also, I really appreciate and recognize that you are doing this for the sake of improving how WP runs, and not simply as a humanitarian gesture towards yours truly, which would be silly for anyone to do, though if were doing so, that would indeed be greatly appreciated.\nGriswaldo: (I'm male) Feel free to quote me on this if you wish as long as its not egregiously out of context.

The problem with the AfD issue is that the Arbs seem to be contradicting themselves on whether AfDs fall under a topic ban or not. Because of the confusion, there is no need to accuse anyone of doing anything improper or call for apologies. I'll still be waiting for you to explain how I improperly tried to restrict your behavior on your own talk page. --\nChildofMidnight: You attack me for pointing out that you placed false restrictions on me saying that's not true, and then even after you find the diff showing you the exact behavior I described, you continue to go after me.

You had no problem with avoiding the AfD at the time, and did not complain about anything I said there when I said it. I did not remove your comment at the AfD, and indeed only commented after the fact (and not ''really'' about the AfD&mdash;I just said Walpin was Obama related which is clearly true). My basis for saying you ought not comment on the AfD were specific remarks (linked above) from several arbs about the general issue of topic bans. Nothing I said in that thread was remotely \\\"aggressive,\\\" and you have not explained how saying you cannot edit an AfD is \\\"improper\\\" when you did not complain about it at the time. Wizardman's recent comment suggests you ''could have'' edited the AfD (we'll see if other Arbs agree), but I was interpreting the remedies in what seemed the appropriate way and was not the only admin who saw it that way.

","229812":"Mackensen: I confess that for once I'm very frustrated by the functioning of this project's processes and am not sure where to turn next. I'm told that templates such as these are often deleted, but no one seems to know why. I don't think anyone was particularly sensitive to the template's relationship to other templates and articles, and I know that my arguments were ignored during the TfD. As an editor, I'm being told that I cannot place a navigational box on an article, but no one will give me an actual reason why not. I would appreciate an explanation and any guidance as to where I might go next. \nShereth: When it comes to the utility of navigational templates (or templates in general) a key question to ask is the utility thereof, and more to the point, how many pages it will be used on.  If a template is likely to only be used on one or two pages, I can see how the argument might be made as to its limited utility; in these cases, it might be easier to simply build it directly into the article it is being used on rather than transcluded via a template.  For what it is worth, please remember that as the closer of the DRV, I am not endorsing the deletion of it, merely noting that the consensus was to endorse it. \nMackensen: Sure, I could just use the Navbox on the page, but that'll break if anyone ever tries to edit it. Valid non-prose content re-used on multiple pages is the definition of a template. I'm still at a loss as to how the original deletion is valid, and I feel like no one in the process since then has actually grappled with the deletion policy and how it might or might not have been applied. You can't have a consensus based on a false understanding of policy, so I hope you can tell me how the original deletion was valid. Best, \nLeadSongDog: I might observe that the template's name was very presumptious, given the number of other institutions worldwide that are called [[Xavier]] or [[St Francis Xavier]], some of which actually have active football programs. \nShereth: {{ec}} I understand your frustration at the situation. I would say that the situation can be best viewed as the application of an unwritten ''de facto'' policy as opposed to a written ''de jure'' policy. Remember that for the most part, policy on Wikipedia should be descriptive rather than prescriptive; if, as has been posited in this debate, it is common practice at [[WP:TFD]] to delete templates of limited scope and\\\/or utility, then perhaps the relevant policies need to be adjusted to reflect this common practice. My hands are tied with regards to the DRV as the consensus there was unambiguously to uphold the previous closure. My best suggestion as far as where you can \\\"turn next\\\" is to bring this up for discussion somewhere relevant (the talk page[s] of the relevant policies\\\/guidelines perhaps) to determine whether this \\\"common practice\\\" is as common as has been stated, and if so, how to make note of it in policy to avert future confusion. \nMackensen: In other words, you upheld an outcome you knew to be procedurally invalid?

Remember, I'm the one who spoke up on the VfU and said \\\"Keep deleted.\\\"  At the time of the VfU, I didn't even know these records existed.  It would be fruitless, though, to Speedy those user subpages.  They would simply be undeleted for being out-of-process deletions.  I personally believe that uncertified RfCs should be deleted and the slate wiped clean -- that's why the policy calls for it.  However, there is very well established precedent allowing users to keep records of just about anything in a subpage of their user space.  There's no way around it.  If you want those deleted, you're going to have to take it through VfD, which of course drags the whole thing back into the public eye.  If you can convince someone to Speedy them, *I* won't undelete them, but you can be sure someone will.  \nNetoholic: I don't agree.  Vacuum only gave up on the VfU (after quite a few people said it should stay deleted) because he knew he had this backup.

I'm heartened by the comment that my assessment of the scale of the job is shared by others, but as I said, I don't think it should take quite ''that'' long. Some of the books and papers will not be that relevant and won't need a full analysis or summary. It helps that I've read some of them already, but it doesn't help that many are also ones I haven't got round to reading yet. Anyway, if you could take a brief look at [[User:Astraflame\\\/Tolkien Bibliography|this]] and its associated pages, [[User:Astraflame\\\/Tolkien Disregarded Sources|here]] and [[User:Astraflame\\\/Tolkien Incomplete References|here]] and suggest an appropriate way to tackle this, it would be much appreciated. \nCarcharoth: I've started [[User talk:Astraflame\\\/Tolkien Bibliography]] and put a list there. Again, any advice on the best place to start would be appreciated. Expanding the articles on the books that have articles? Using the books to add tidbits to various subsidiary articles such as [[List of Middle-earth plants]] and [[List of Middle-earth weapons and armour]], adding stuff to \\\"top level\\\" articles such as [[Middle-earth]], [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Hobbit]] and [[The Silmarillion]]? \nAwadewit: [[User:Astraflame\\\/Tolkien Bibliography]] - These are all sources published in the last few years, so the list is unrepresentative of Tolkien scholarship. 2) There is no way of knowing from this list which of the sources are ''important'' in Tolkien scholarship. You need to read around for a bit and identify who the important Tolkien scholars are and begin with them. For example, after reading for the [[Mary Shelley]] article, I know who the important Shelley scholars are and therefore whose views are important to include in the article. Not every article published on Shelley is important and some can be discarded. However, it takes a little while to develop a sense for whose ideas are repeated and who is repeatedly quoted in the scholarship. Sometimes there are \\\"introductions\\\" for the public, as there is for [http:\\\/\\\/books.google.com\\\/books?id=rJbovw3v3GkC&dq=introduction+to+jane+austen Jane Austen] and this can be helpful because such books will outline the important works of scholarship for you. \nAwadewit: [[User talk:Astraflame\\\/Tolkien Bibliography]] - ''We should also aim to identify the key sources and concentrate on those. Any ideas for what criteria to use? I would suggest starting with the books and journals that we have articles on.'' - It is an excellent idea to come up with a key list of sources, but whether or not Wikipedia has an article on something is not really relevant to a piece of scholarship's importance. For criteria, I would again suggest using \\\"what is important in Tolkien scholarship\\\", which can be established by reading the scholarship. While working on [[Jane Austen]], [[User:Simmaren|Simmaren]] and I split up the reading and put most of our [[User:Simmaren\\\/Sandbox\\\/Jane Austen\\\/Collaboration Work Page|notes online]]. We decided to work with about 30 books of literary criticism. We have more biographies and of course we have added some specialized books since then, but that is our core. I can tell you that just keeping these 30 straight is difficult. I would start with identifying 30 core Tolkien books. We spent months reading to find these 30. It may be, however, that you need a combination of books and articles, so you will need more than 30. \nAwadewit: When it comes to which articles to work on and then summarize in the main [[Lord of the Rings]] article, that is tough. There are clearly a lot of possibilities and if you try to do everything, you will be bogged down forever. You need to make firm choices at the beginning--limit yourselves! For the Austen article, Simmaren and I have decided to work on: [[Timeline of Jane Austen]], [[Reception history of Jane Austen]], [[User:Simmaren\\\/Sandbox\\\/Jane Austen|Styles and themes of Jane Austen - draft]], [[User:Simmaren\\\/Sandbox\\\/Juvenilia (Jane Austen)|Juvenilia (Jane Austen) - draft]], and [[User:Simmaren\\\/Sandbox\\\/Draft Jane Austen's Family|Family of Jane Austen - draft]]. This is our core set of Austen articles. We are not working on everything in the [[Template:Jane Austen|Jane Austen template]], although we might work on the novel articles later. We decided that to effectively write the main article, what we needed to write were these five articles. That is the kind of decision you need to make for LoTR - what do you need to write about to effectively write the main article? I would, for example, suggest either working on the individual novel pages OR working on the general [[Themes of The Lord of the Rings]] kinds of articles. In that way, you will obtain some of the information that was missing from the main article. Subarticles such as [[Adaptations of The Lord of the Rings]] or [[Reception of J. R. R. Tolkien]] seem important as well. (From the template, it looks like some of the articles should be combined.) I see no need for working on any of the articles that detail the minutiae of Middle-Earth, unless you are just dying to do so. :) \nAstraflame: Hi Awadewit! As a new Wikipedian, it is reassuring for me to see a more veteran member of Wikipedia echo a few of the thoughts that I have been having regarding a) how un-definitive of a bibliography I posted and b) how to go from there to actually do the work towards getting an actual definitive account of Tolkien scholarship and improving the Wikipedia articles. I think your approach sounds great! Based on what you've said though, would it be correct for me to extrapolate that it sounds like you won't be actually joining us in the collaboration given your time being occupied with other projects? We would greatly appreciate your help, if you have the time and\\\/or any Tolkien resources handy. So please feel free to pitch in if that is the case. However, I completely understand if you're busy with other things, and am already very grateful with the help that you have already provided. Many thanks, \nAstraflame: I made the above comment after only taking a brief glance at your talk page and without reading through your user page to see the extent of your activities. Again, I reiterate my thanks and appreciation for any support that you or anyone else on the FA-team is willing to provide to the Middle-earth wikiproject, but as we're currently nearing the hunkering down and reading phase, I completely understand that you have other projects to work on, but may bother you when all of the reading is over (oh, a year from now, or something..) when we need copy-editing and more general Wikipedia help. Thanks again, \nCarcharoth: I'd like to add my thanks for the helpful advice. Just a few brief responses. The reason some books and scholars have Wikipedia articles is precisely ''because'' these are the leading works and scholars. Articles on other books and scholars (though they do exist) should in the main be taken to AfD and booted out of the door (ahem, I mean merged carefully to the overview articles). :-) The history of Tolkien scholarship may ''seem'' unrepresentative, but one of the reasons is that for a long time Tolkien studies was \\\"not respectable\\\". Now, for various reasons, there has been an explosion (and that is not overstating it) in Tolkien scholarship. Of course, that means there has been an explosion in dross as well as the good stuff, but that is why there is so much from recent years. There is early stuff (from before 1984) that absolutely needs to be covered, but doing so requires digging out obscure sources (which I will be trying to do). The suggestion of working either on the books, or on the \\\"themes\\\" article is a good one. The AfD nomination (\\\"patience exhausted\\\" - following an AfD nomination a year ago) of the themes article might force that decision! Either the article gets deleted and we have to start from scratch, or it doesn't because we've started work on it. <small>I should probably drop Astraflame a note not to get discouraged by the AfD nomination, as old-timers who are used to AfD nominations when no-one has got round to working on an article, might not appreciate the impact it has on relatively new editors.<\\\/small> Anyway, getting back to Tolkien scholarship, the ones we have articles on are the major scholars of the past decade and sometimes more: [[Tom Shippey]], [[Verlyn Flieger]], [[Wayne Hammond]], [[Christina Scull]], [[Douglas A. Anderson]], [[Michael D. C. Drout]], and [[Christopher Tolkien]] himself. Slightly removed from this group, but interesting for other reasons, is [[Richard E. Blackwelder]]. There are a host of other \\\"names\\\", but pretty soon you reach a grey borderline area of people who don't work full-time on this, but are still considered \\\"experts\\\". For instance, two of the big \\\"names\\\" in the linguistic side of things are [[Carl F. Hostetter]] and [[David Salo]]. And then, of course, there are \\\"up-and-coming\\\" names who are currently establishing a reputation (I won't mention any names, as that would be a bit too subjective). I should probably mention [[Walking Tree Publishers]] though, as they are rather active in publishing things at the moment (see [http:\\\/\\\/www.walking-tree.org\\\/cormareBookInfo.php?number=17 here] for an example of their output), and [[John Rateliff]] (no article yet) for his work on [[The History of The Hobbit]] (that alone might be enough to \\\"establish\\\" him, but as that work is recent, only time will tell). As far as academic, peer-reviewed journals go, for years what there was was mostly fanzines and fan-produced journals of varying quality. In the UK and US you had (and still have) [[Mallorn (journal)]] (from [[The Tolkien Society]]) and [[Mythlore]] (from the [[Mythopoeic Society]]). Good scholarship was also found in some of the publications from other national and regional Tolkien societies, particuarly the one in Germany and Sweden (see [[Reception of J. R. R. Tolkien]]). The quality of these \\\"society journals\\\" has varied over time, but in general standards have increased (though quite how you demonstrate that subjective opinion is beyond me). The big player now, though, is [[Tolkien Studies]], established in 2004, which claims to be the first scholarly journal published by an academic press in the area of [[Tolkien studies]]. Finally, you have the major conferences and the proceedings of those conferences. There was a major academic conference in 1992, the Tolkien Centenary Conference 1992 (see [http:\\\/\\\/www.tolkiensociety.org\\\/1992\\\/index.html here]). The only comparable ones in either size or prestige, I think, were the conferences held over the period 2004 to 2005 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the publication of LotR. These include the Blackwelder memorial conference (see [http:\\\/\\\/www.marquette.edu\\\/library\\\/information\\\/news\\\/2006\\\/jrrt_proceedings.html here] - small, but the author list, for the most part, reads as a \\\"who's who\\\" of Tolkien studies at that time) and the forthcoming proceedings of the Tolkien 2005 conference (see [http:\\\/\\\/www.tolkiensociety.org\\\/2005\\\/proceedings\\\/index.html here]).  There, a brief little history (with all too little on the early history) and an explanation of some of the major players, which I hope demonstrates both how nascent and how burgeoning the field is.

Everything you have said amounts to advisory: nothing justifies a ''block'' for TP usage. The only explanation for that is fear and paranoia on the part of arbcomm, which I think is the correct explanation (which is to say: although you were too stupid to recognise me as an expert, you know full well that others aren't, and value my opinions. You know that contrary to the gaily-experssed opinions of the arbs in this case, I'm not just one-of-many. Therefore, unlike in previous cases, you need to crush all dissent). The fundamental point is that the edits I made to my talkpage were not disruptive: the disruption comes from the responses. And by that I don't mean the responses from people editing, but responses from the shit-stirrers like TS and EfV. Had the shit-stirring been ignored, as it should have been, there would have been no problem.

The cite, if you are referring to [http:\\\/\\\/www.aol.co.nz\\\/news\\\/story\\\/What-the-frak%27-Faux-curse-seeping-into-language\\\/930021\\\/index.html] is a dead link, with nothing in the [[Internet Archive]]. (I found a couple of other cites, searching for the article title and the author, so I can confirm that he uses \\\"feldercarb\\\", for what it's worth.) I can pull it up at the university library tomorrow if necessary, but I also note that a search of the two terms shows more hits for \\\"fergercarb\\\" than \\\"feldercarb\\\", and the Battlestar Galactica wiki redirects the latter to the former, and here on WP, [[Felgercarb]] is a redirect to [[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)#Language]] and [[Feldercarb]] is a redlink. (Yes, I am aware that none of these are reliable sources, either.) However, [http:\\\/\\\/www.post-gazette.com\\\/pg\\\/08296\\\/921644-42.stm this reference], from the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' '''is''' a reliable source, using the \\\"felgercarb\\\" spelling. So is [http:\\\/\\\/www.ew.com\\\/ew\\\/article\\\/0,,20262253,00.html this one], from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. Arguably, [http:\\\/\\\/www.roanoke.com\\\/editorials\\\/trejbal\\\/wb\\\/51711 this editorial] from the ''[[Roanoke Times]]''  and [http:\\\/\\\/www.jsonline.com\\\/blogs\\\/entertainment\\\/40533172.html this blog] from the ''[[Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel]]'' also qualify. It's not terribly important to me, since it's all fiction, but I do have a bit of trouble with you using your own edit summary as a justification to revert, when there are obviously other sources which indicate otherwise, and apparently more than one other editor has noted the same discrepancy. '''\nUncle G: You are not reading.  The edit summaries are amply clear that I'm using ''the source cited'', right there in the article, as justification for having the article say the same thing as the source says.  As I pointed out in the ''first'' edit summary, the talk page arguments were not verifiability in action.  Neither are your counting Google hits or looking at what redirects we have and haven't yet created.  Google hits have zero meaning.  All of the things cited at [[Wikipedia:Search engine test#References]] should be enough to disabuse anyone of any erroneous notions to the contrary.<p>It is a falsehood to say that ''anyone at all'' has pointed out a discrepancy.  Not even you did in your edit summary.  Certainly the other editor didn't.  See what is actually written on the article's talk page.  ''I'' am the only person to have pointed out a discrepancy, namely the discrepancy between the spelling changes made and what the source cited says.  It's ''only now'' that you're doing the ''right'' thing, that actually makes a proper argument, which is citing more sources.  That's what you should have done ''at the time'', rather than make an unsourced change where it had already once been pointed out that the change made the article not match the source actually cited for the content.<p>However, you should note that Dudek2009 makes no mention of profanity and is talking about toothpaste on eBay.  There's no indication that xe's using the spelling from the show itself, or the spelling of the profanity rather than of the toothpaste brand name.  Bernardin2009 is talking about toothpaste, too.   Trejbal2006 is better than either of those two, as is Linn2008, since at least they are talking about profanity rather than toothpaste.  So the question, which should be raised on the article's talk page, as really this here should have been, is whether they defeat Tabott2008, since that latter is the only one of the three that explicitly pays attention to spelling, and the only one where it seems likely that the journalist at one point asked \\\"How do you spell that, please, Mr Larson?\\\".  \nHorologium: The reason I didn't go to the talk page or the edit history first is that I didn't realize that a) the dead link was being used as a reference for the spelling of the word (which I didn't consider to be particularly contentious), and b) I didn't realize that the spelling change had been reverted before. I normally don't check for disputes when wiki-gnoming in generally non-contentious areas; it looked like a typo to me. Only after you reverted it (with a rather testy edit summary) did I go and look at what you were going on about. As I clearly noted in my first response, I am fully aware of the limitations of open wikis and Ghits (I explicitly stated that I knew that they were not appropriate sources), which is why I followed up with the reliable sources. (I actually spent about 30 minutes on that reply, adding and subtracting text as I found references. I had intended to remove the section about going to the library, since I found copies of the dead linked article in newspaper websites.)<p>Bernardin is not talking only about toothpaste, he is also talking about the profanity; read the last sentence of the first paragraph. And it's not at all apparent that Talbott asked about the spelling of Felgercarb\\\/feldercarb, because it is only mentioned once as an aside; the rest of the article focuses on frack\\\/frak, and the variable spelling of ''that'' word is a topic addressed by Talbott. (FWIW, I am reading a copy of the Talbott article [http:\\\/\\\/www.capetimes.co.za\\\/index.php?fSectionId=3531&fArticleId=vn20080908054049167C503412 here]; if there is more to the article, I don't have access to it.) I may take this to the article talk page, although I originally had not planned to do so; I have never edited the article before, and probably would not have edited again if not for the sharp tone in your edit summary. I encountered the article by chance when following links, and fixed what appeared to be a minor error (and note that my edit summary made it quite clear what I had changed). I didn't expect such an abrupt reversion without any discussion at all. (And no, you haven't discussed it on the talk page either.)

I know at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Tennessee]], while wholesale removal of notable residents is not desired, it ''does'' seem to be the case that if someone is to be noted, any such mentions should provide evidence that the person strongly influenced that town. For a place like Nashville, this becomes increasingly difficult, compared to a notable person from a small town like Jellico (one of the examples provided in the WT:WPTN thread). I admit I was too brief in my statement in the edit summary, but I strongly disagree that either Cyrus or Kesha have strongly impacted Nashville as a whole.

In my view, this is anathema to Wikipedia, and not what the ArbCom was originally intended to do. I usually don't have time to really get into the ArbCom elections and find out who's who, instead I tend to just support the candidates I know and trust personally, not that this is a good idea, mind you. With that said, I personally think Will Beback and Raul654 are good candidates. Let me know if you know about anyone else that might be compelling. \nAwadewit: With 27 candidates, it is overwhelming, but I have managed to make it through all of the candidate statements and questions. :) However, I don't think candidate statements and questions are everything. And what does it mean when someone refuses to answer questions? I can interpret that in a myriad of ways (especially being an English person). I noticed that Raul654 also fills many other positions here at wikipedia (as do some of the other candidates). Do you think this is an advantage or a disadvantage to being a member of ArbCom? Does it give the person a wider experience of wikipedia or does it detract from their ability to focus on ArbCom? Should they focus on ArbCom? I really feel very uncertain about all of this. I feel much more certain about the upcoming US Presidential primaries. I know exactly who I'm going to vote for. :) Thanks for taking the time to respond - I appreciate it.

These notifications were mostly done by Shadowmorph and myself (and I'm glad to say they are one aspect of this story that hasn't created friction so far.) \nJ.delanoy: I had not seen your reply on the AR\\\/C page before now. Just to clarify, I did not intentionally neglect to place notification of the RFC in various places.

It took me approximately two and a half hours to update the pages and file the RfC. Just as I finished filing the RfC, my dinner (pizza) arrived, so I went to go eat. When I got back, everyone was going crazy because Michael Jackson had been confirmed dead, so I got caught up in trying to help maintain order in that area, and the Macedonia issue completely slipped my mind. When I remembered the next morning, Future Perfect at Sunrise and I believe Shadowmorph had already placed notification in all of the obvious places.

In the future, I will make sure that I complete each task I am doing before I move on to another one. \nCarcharoth: No problem. Doesn't sound foolish at all, and it is reassuring to know that there was a plan in place for the referees to do the notifications, even if the meltdown from the Michael Jackson news did disrupt things.

It's in German, however. You can see that it includes interviews with various people who offer different viewpoints.

Kim, the reports regarding the collapse of the World Trade center are pretty boring to read. One of the problems with the article [[Collapse of the World Trade Center]] is that for it to be even a good article, much less a featured one, we need some editors with structural engineering and related disciplines to improve the engineering aspects of that article...much of the engineering reports about how the buildings collapsed is technical jargon not easily translated into more easily readable prose. There have been more than a dozen independent engineering studies conducted on various aspects of the collapse, some dealing with metallurgy, others that have examined fire and others that have investigated design issues. When the U.S. Government first started working on finding out how the buildings collapsed, (aside from the obvious which was high speed impact by wide body jets, extensive fires, and peripheral damage to surrounding structures and infrastructure), they appointed the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to lead the investigation...that agency specializes in disaster response more than engineering in itself...so after preliminary reports came out from FEMA, the questions regarding how the buildings collapsed were not adequately addressed, so the feds had the National Institude of Standards and Technology (NIST) take over since they have that expertise, though had never had to deal with such a massive study..hence, the final reports took years to produce.

This is false on wikipedia, which have to display several swine flu articles, and to keep them specific. Please, help me to keep the places clean and specific. \nTimVickers: Hey there.

Once we have more information on this H1N1 strain we could split the articles into one on this human-transmissible strain and a second more general one about \\\"swine influenza\\\", but presently we're stuck with this nomenclature. \nYug: I'm not a native English speaker, please help me to find the best solution. \nYug: The currently use title 'Swine flu' alone is not clear enough now, meaning both '2009 mexican flu' and 'thousand years old pig-to-pig flu'. Accordingly, this unclear tittle should be avoid. \nTimVickers: I know, it is a problem but I'm not sure what to do about it. \nYug: I can do the rename of Swine flu into 'Pig farms swine flu'.
