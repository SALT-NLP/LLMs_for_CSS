{"Conversation":{"0":"A: == [WIKI_LINK: WP:COMMONNAME] ==\n\n\nB: I notice that earier that  moved wiki_link to Bill Chen citing wiki_link , then you reverted this change, Bill Chen doesn't commonly go by William, his book is even penned as Bill Chen. From what I read in WP:COMMONNAME PatrikR seems to be correct, Examples given are names such as: *wiki_link (not wiki_link) *wiki_link (not wiki_link) I think this revert may have been a mistake unless you know otherwise? \u25aa\u25e6\u25aa \n\nA: Chen was known in the poker world as \"William\" for years before he became commonly known as \"Bill\".  I changed it back because incidences online including Usenet are roughly equal, nothing at all like Bill Clinton and William Clinton, and in equal cases using the real name seems the best choice.  (the external_link page is especially pschizo... Willam in the page title, Bill in the page text).  However I suppose the book is the trump card, so using the name on the book is probably best. \n\nB: I see what you saying I just read his pokerstars profile, It struck me when I saw the change because I remember him being called Bill when I watched the last season of high stakes poker, But you seem to have many more years experience in the Poker\/Gambling world then I do(I'm still a bit of a newbie), so I wanted to check with you first. BTW as far as the WPT, I was thinking nine that made up final and 6 for the tv table, I read this article that say the WPT Final table is made up of 10 players, with the final six that make it on TV,  I just want to be sure that they are correct, when I update the players infobox stats, thanks \u25aa\u25e6\u25aa \n","1":"A: ==List of slang terms for poker hands==\n\n\nB: No more than two editors advocated deletion.  Greatestrowerever and maybe Kymacpherson.  That's not a clear consensus for deletion.  Cheers, \n\nA: In the future please don't close Afds when you don't have the courtesy of reading the comments.  All comments favored deletion except two.  Please don't be so careless in the future. \n\nB: That simply isn't true.  If you read the comments, you'll find it's actually 2 keep, 4 transwiki, 2 delete (more or less).  The ''comments'' favour no consensus\/transwiki.  The \"votes\" favour delete, but voting is evil, of course... \n\nA: Somehow, I suspect you may wish to participate in wiki_link discussion.  Cheers, \n\nB: I assume your deliberate lying has a point, but get over it.  Stop bizarrely goin on about transwiking.  That has nothing to do with the afd.  There was a plain consensus for deleting the article. Transwikiing is completely unrelated. Please don't be so deliberately obtuse in the future.  wasting other people's time is simply rude. \n","2":"A: == Could you stop reverting my corrections ==\n\n\nB: If you have problems with my edits to the 4WD page please let me know, do not just revert the edits.  Although the 4WD article is very accurate the introduction is riddled with errors, which I corrected.  I think it is everyone's best interests to make Wiki pages as accurate as possible and the Four Wheel Drive article is not a gleaming example of this. i.e. All-wheel drive is just a marketing term invented to sell primarily on-road 4WD-type cars This is completely inaccurate AWD is no JUST a marketing term. AWD is very different from 4WD and I explained the differences in my edits. There are also blatant contradictions in this introduction as well. So please instead of immediately reverting my edits tell me what your disagreement is.  If you feel that my edit was inaccurate the please let me know why so this can be resolved. Thank You \n\nA: *Shrug* It *is* just a marketing term. I wish you lot would stop editing it otherwise. Billzilla. \n\nB: Although AWD can be considered a form of 4WD it is not the same drive train type as Part-Time 4WD.  So I would have to say calling it just a marketing term is a narrow minded and inaccurate statement.  Even though they are similar you can't just lob them into the same group.  If, as you say, AWD is just a marketing term then taking a turn in a Audi A6 Quattro would produce wheel hop just as taking a turn in a Ford F-250 4x4 with 4WD engaged, which is not the case.  So apparently there is a difference, which would be the center differential in the Audi A6 allowing each wheel to receive a variable amount of power.  Which is not true of 4WD vehicles because a transfer case ,unless a Full-Time 4WD transfer case, will force all wheels to receive 25% of the engine's power. \n","3":"A: ==Regarding edits to [WIKI_LINK: Talk:George W. Bush]==\n\n\nB: Please stop removing and altering other editors' comments. What appeared to be valid concern is quickly descending into trolling, and if you continue, you may be blocked from editing. Stop it. - \n\nA:  Well please stop posting incorrect information. If you were right I'd agree with you, and I am NOT trolling. \n\nB: external_link is trolling, as is removing other people's comments. Look, Wikipedia is built on consensus, and consensus has it that we use American style for American subjects. End of story. Any more complaint about trolling about this topic and I'll report you myself. \n\nA:  Bullshit. I am correcting a simple mistake. If I was trolling I'd be doing damage to the page, yet I  am not. What was written is wrong, simple as that. All I have done is disagree with what was written and written as such. If that's trolling then you are guilty as well. And stop unediting MY page dickhead. Billzilla. \n","4":"A: ==WP:RS==\n\n\nB: Please stop including disreputable sources for this article.  Wikipedia policy is quite clear on this matter  blogs and other websites which do not employ editorial oversight of authors' work are not permitted as sources here.  Please stop adding blogs. \n\nA: Please stop deleting reputable sources from this article.  You have deleted Joe Wilson's NYT article that is a key factor in this whole controversy!  Among others.  Simply because the article is printed on a different site does not mean it is sourced to a \"heinous blog\" (which the site is not anyway).  If you find a better place that the article exists, put it there.  Or if you have trouble with the link, make a case for deleting the link, but not the whole citation!  You also deleted a notable article in the notable, non-blog, journalistic source wiki_link, a notable article from the well known and respected scholarly project wiki_link, a notable, on-topic view of wiki_link by wiki_link, and a notable interview with wiki_link.  Many of these are cited in the article and thus should be in an accurate list of references!  wiki_link does not mean that quoted sources should not be cited.  It also does not mean that you can only link to the NYT website.  It also does not mean that you delete an entire citation just because you don't think the website on which the citation is found is reliable  you can actually cite stuff here that isn't on the web at all!  Notable interviews (esp ones that are quoted in the article) on notable radio programs should be cited here even if you don't think the website on which the transcription appears is \"reliable.\"  Please stop deleting notable information.  Thanks! \n\nB: The American Prospect article should stay - American Prospect easily meets wiki_link. The Cooperative Research Project link should be nuked and should stay nuked - I see no evidence that it's a reliable source. Factcheck.org is reliable enough that the Vice President of the United States (incorrectly) cited it in his debate as an authoritative source; they have a good reputation, and their very ''purpose'' is to engage in rigorous fact-checking. The commondreams.org reposting of the Joe Wilson article is a verbatim copy; I just checked myself. I'd nuke the Alternet.org posting; quite frankly, unless they're reposting information from AP, Reuters, the NYTimes, or something else, they're even less reliable than Fox News - which takes some doing, I will say. Furthermore, it's an edited transcript; we have no way of knowing what was edited. The source I'm least certain of is the Philip Giraldi interview; I'm not entirely certain of the relevance.  * \n\nA: Agreed ojn Cooperative Research but not the Alternet citation - they are transcribing an interview on a well known radio show with a well known source with expertise on this topic whose comments are cited in numerous mainstream sources.  If you have a better source for the transcript that is fine but you cannot just delete it because it is \"edited\" - unless you have evidence that they are making stuff up, we must presume good faith on the part of journalists involved.  The interview is also directly cited in the article; you cannot just delete citations when they are quoted sources; the same is true of the Giraldi interview. \n\nB: Actually, especially with Alternet, we ''can't'' assume good faith; we need to do exactly the opposite. We need to examine sources critically, according to the guidelines on wiki_link. Were it to be a verbatim copy, perhaps we could accept it as a source (''perhaps'' being absolutely critical), but because it's edited and doesn't contain information on how it's been edited, and because it comes from a notoriously unreliable source, it can't really be trusted. And, again, I question the relevance of the Giraldi interview.  * \n\nA: (1) Please substantiate that the source is \"notoriously unreliable.\"  (2) Please indicate where it says we should assume bad faith with sources that are transcripts of interviews (I know the quote in the article is directly from the interview as I listened to the interview myself; I also have looked at the transcript and do not see anything that is different from what I heard; but apparently I should not trust my own ears either?)  Find another source for the interview if you like but you cannot delete it based on your assertion that it is \"notoriously\" unreliable (this is the first I've heard of this alleged \"notoriety,\" btw).  (3) Care to substantiate your assertion that you \"question the relevance\" of the Giraldi interview?  I explained its relevance above and you simply repeated your claim.- \n","5":"A: ==Iran caught smuggling uranium==\n\n\nB: This story about Iran supports the concern that Iraq was trying to get uranium from Africa.  It also confirms the wiki_link saying President Bush comments about Iraq seeking uranium from Africa were \"well-founded.\"  It also points out that wiki_link is either incompetent or liar or both. \n\nA: It's too bad it doesn't mention that Iran and Iraq are not the same country. \n\nB: But it certainly blows holes in the argument by Joseph Wilson that no isolated country could get hold of uranium from Africa.  But of course, we knew Wilson was a liar long ago.  He found out Saddam was looking for uranium in 1999 and then wrote his op-ed piece saying there was no evidence Saddam was looking for uranium. \n\nA: Get a grip Ron.  First you confuse Iran and Iraq, then you claim you are right anyway because you think Wilson is a liar.  If you think Wilson is a liar, why don't you call Fitzgerald and let him know?  Leave this crap off of Wikipedia.  The article you linked never mentions Wilson or Iraq. \n","6":"A: I agree with Idleguy. 8-Pass charlie is a very insignificant component of the airwar. I am sure as we go along there will be hundreds of small stubs that will be created. They all cannot be linked at the top of the article. You can however link them in the links \/   references etc. 3 Squadron also falls in the same bracket. where will we stop? We will end up listing all the IAF and PAF squadrons that ever took part in the war in \"See also\" or \"Main article\" etc. Links to such stubs \/ secondary articles should go in list of links at the bottom of the page. \n\nB: Idleguy reverted the edit that moved 8 pass charlie from the aerial warfare to the see also section. His argument was that it is \"insignificant\". While I disagree that it is insignificant, that's the worst argument ever to be made to revert. It is wiki_link and is wiki_link. Also, it is relevant because this relates to a combatant in the conflict, and linking allows both the articles to develop. It was also placed in the appropriate section following discussion in this talk page, which means the effort was made to reach a compromise. I am just wondering what other way is the best way to link these articles together. \n\nA: The only consensus here, as Jaiiaf has also concurred is that it would lead to a plethora of see also links. As if the see also is a required section in the first place. Few, if any of the FA articles posses see also links. With immediate effect I'm removing the see also section since it adds little and everything is linked properly in the article. You are acting against the consensus here, i.e. it's insignificant. I can appreciate that you've taken the time to create the article, but that doesn't elevate it to the significance to be mentioned in the main war. Like i said, add it to the PAF history page. I find you haven't done that. Thanks. \n\nB:  There were two consensuses, including that it could be added to ''the seperate see also section'' without crowding the relevant section. To get over that, you deleted the whole see also section. I think you are not trying to meet me halfway here, and moreover assuming ownership over the article. I really can't understand what your objection is. It is a biographical stub, and could be expanded by link from this very relevant page. ''You'' are claiming it is insignificant, I am claiming it is interesting trivia and a notable stub that has the chance to improve. ''Me having created the article'' doesn't have anything to do with it. I'd rather you discussed this with me via out talkpages before we start what is increasingly looking like an edit war. \n\nA:  You are somehow missing the larger picture. You yourself state that it is an \"interesting trivia\". I would agree with the assessment that it is trivial. The see also section is not the hallmark of a good article and thus I think it should go. I am perplexed that you should re-add the entire 'See also' section - whose links to the 47 war, siachen etc. are properly embedded in the article - just so that this one \"trivia\" stub of yours can be linked. Isn't that a tad too much of over stretching? If you want it to be improved then use the right stub tags and request someone to improve it. Simply linking it in the see also section of a war is hardly the right way to improve articles. There are 101 such trivial\/non-trivial stuff from the war, not including the battles etc. Should we start a ballooning list of links to articles of minor importance attached to this article? \n\nB:  I made a few edits right now.  The War links are not needed in the See Also section in the bottom. They are already there in the info box on the top. I have moved the other two lines to \"Further Reading\".  The Reason - there seems to be more chapters on further reading \/ external links \/ notes and references than there are on the main text of the article.  IMHO even the external lnks section should be merged with the further reading section. Reg the notability of 8 Pass Charlie - its left to debate. Sooner or later you will have small trivia items added and we will have to hive \"Aerial Warfare of 65\" into a seperate page. The links might be more appropriate there == \n\nA: . . \n","7":"A: == The \"neutrals\" who don't have the knowledge ==\n\n\nB: Firstly I'm not one of the \"gang\" nor is AreJay or anyone here as Grace seems to put it. Secondly the \"neutral\" view itself is not really well educated nor do they properly read the threads or history of the pages concerned. The neutral sources and some biased views are already given in the said articles. Yet Grace is asking that this user and his sockpuppets come to the talk page and show his sources. I wonder why a vandal would frequent a talk page? I don't see him coming and if anyone believes he is going to discuss this openly is naive. Secondly the problem isn't only to this article but ALL  articles related to the India pakistan wars. Incase these neutrals don't have time to read or understand here's the lowdown: wiki_link keeps deleting the info on the bengali atrocities wiki_link just read it dammit. wiki_link more vandalism wiki_link copyvio images and copyvio text from biased sources wiki_link blatant copyvio images and jingoistic text wiki_link minor changes to suit his POV. Incase it has not been noticed he has a pattern of simply reverting to his previous version without engaging in discussion like we are doing here. So the fact is while we talk about this and try to resolve he jolly well seems to care less for Wikipedia or its neutral stance and simply reverts to his POV. In those articles too, users like myself and other different users have reverted it to the non-chauvinistic versions time & again.  is asking for this vandal to come to the talk page and discuss the 1971 war which the miscreant refuses to do. Yet nothing is being done about it or his blatant cut and copy of text from the net. If anyone still has any lingering doubts then search by selecting the sentences used to describe his photos on google and u will get an exact match down to the last punctuation error. To avoid such future disputes I suggest that people should have a user account incase they want to break the 3 revert rule. that way it would be easier to block the user. Even now one of his sockpuppets Napoleon12 can be blocked. \n\nA: I happily agree with Grace Note and I shall back my sources up with fact. I am currently happy with the unbiased point of view of this article. I might have to do more research in the Self-Defence wars of Pakistan, and it may take me a few days. \n\nB: Are you the sockpuppet vandal who keeps reverting back to ur own biased statements which themselves are lifted directly from www.pakdef.info without even changing the copyrights tag? lol. don't u worry cuz u are quite close to getting banned. you should be ashamed if you are cuz u r involved in POV, copyright violation of images and entire articles shamelessly. \n","8":"A: == vandalism ==\n\n\nB: im sorry to have been mistaken but whoever wrote that article made a miscalculation when determining the speed from knots to kph, 1 knot is 1.85 of a mile. therefore 10 knots is 18.5 miles per hour. am i not correct? \n\nA:  You don't seem to know the difference between mph and kph. 25 knots is 46 km\/h, as the article read allready. \n\nB: you have all the info from pat miller wrong...now he will scold you message me back \n","9":"A: == Vandalism?  ==\n\n\nB: Why is is vandalism to add references to recent events that anyone can find after a moment's googling? You some PR guy for the college or what? \n\nA: I'm no \"pr-guy for the college\". But it is not the style for an encyclopedia to add disparaging links of this type. You find more about external links at the wiki_link. \n\nB: Sorry about the shannanigans. I've never thought about another account before and would quite honestly frown upon it. Its just I don't like my edit count rocketing when I am in the middle of doing repetitive edits. Many people judge the WIkipedians by number of edits as final. Maybe I should carry on with mine for all edits and pretty soon it'll be in the top 3. even for those bot type edits that are made by the second . \n\nA: Well, thanks for your time ;-). I don't see why you shouldn't just accept being a top-ten editor, though. \n\nB: So you think it's approriate for an encyclopedia article to come across as if written by a PR department? The article has no content in the slightest bit critical or even informative. The article is a transcription of some administration office's blather and anything possibly interpretable as negative is spun positively. You're a PR schmuck and that's it if you disallow discordant points of view. Removing my link to the riots and animal cruelty at the school simply make the article incomplete in the same way the catalog is. The links are not in the slightest bit disparaging either. They link to verifiable sources that are neutral (news organizations). Maybe in Norway, the truth is disparaging if it's embarrassing (to you). What a moron. Nautilogos \n","10":"A: == SocialVibe ==\n\n\nB: I was a bit disgruntled you recently deleted my article on SocialVibe, especially just after it had been patrolled.  I am a user of the site who was interested in its message and felt compelled to look further into it (seriously, my sources are the first couple things that popped up after a google search).  I am a bit confused why a well written and documented article (my first) about an up and coming social networking website with well over 25,000 subscribers and almost 150,000 unique visitors each month (http:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/company\/socialvibe) is any less relevant than say, Sandis Valters whose brilliantly written article reveals that he is a Latvian guard who plays for ASK Riga.  Having seen such articles before, I did not feel the need to \"justify\" my article; however, I am new at editing\/creating wikipedia articles, did I do something incorrectly?  Please respond as I would like to know what I did wrong... \n\nA: Well, I am not sure if the article meets wiki_link but I think that a claim of 150,000 users a month is a decent claim of notability and there are a few mentions in RS in Google News so could you undelete this article and then send it to AfD where its notability can be better decided. - ''' ''' \n\nB: With regard to the article's lack of notability and a lack of citations, look at wiki_link.  It has only one citation not linking to itself in its entire article (whereas 6 similar sources are used on socialvibe), and it has never logged more than 10,000 unique users\/month in its short history (http:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/company\/bluepulse).  A google search for bluepulse yields 77,000 results, whereas a search for socialvibe gives 146,000.  Bluepulse has big numbers of page views and mobile downloads, but it refuses to tell media outlets how many users acutally use their site.  I like the ideas behind bluepulse's product, but until it is more widely used, it is not yet nearly as notable as socialvibe, nor does their wiki article use nearly as many citations.  And, browsing very quickly through other social networking sites, I am sure that this is not the only one.  Can I put the article back up and go through a standard process for articles for deletion that are not actually spam? \n","11":"A: == [WIKI_LINK: Vandalyze] ==\n\n\nB: I want this topic to be UNprotected, so I suggest you do so. Do you wanna go to war with me? \n\nA: Don't be absurd. Taking it to your talk page.   | \n\nB: Are you a moron? Did you even bother to read this? I'm going to escalate this. I suggest you learn about me before declaring war. . . . \n","12":"A: == Honors section ==\n\n\nB: This section is a mere three lines long. Would anyone object to integrating it into the biographical sections of the article? \n\nA:  Sounds good. \n\nB: Yeah, I moved it to its own section because it was part of the \"Early Life\" section (!). Feel free to integrate it elsewhere. \n\nA:  Sounds good. \n","13":"A: == Bill Vallicella's blog quote ==\n\n\nB: The quote from Vallicella's blog in the criticism section is out of line. For one thing, it is from something titled: \"Is Ayn Rand a Good Philosopher?\" Of course we don't want to put that title into the text (as i have tried) because we don't want anyone to get the impression that Ayn Rand was a bad philosopher, because even that would imply she was in fact a philosopher, which is of course heresy. So we avoid in his quote the fact he does call her a philosopher, but leave in the statement \"limited understanding\"  which of course Bill Vallicella could not really know. She might have had deep understanding, but an inability to articulate herself, for instance. The quote is a punch below the belt  which may be fine for a blog  he's writing a blog after all  but should we be quoting from blog-speak in this article? Not to mention the fact that Vallicella is an American academic, which of course makes anything he has to say on Rand suspect to start with. \n\nA: This is not an encyclopedia article type of criticism and it comes from an invalid source - a blog.  There is valid criticism of Rand in academic journals for those editors that want to hunt it down.  If it were acceptible to use blog's anyone could prove anything, at anytime.  Shall we provide sources that the earth is flat, or that aliens have abducted humans for sex experiments?  This is a slap in the face to the concept of valid sources, just as the deleting of the very solidly sourced \"philosopher\" is a slap in the face of WP. \n\nB: Right. I'll delete it again and we'll see what happens. \n\nA:  Blogs have to be used with caution, but in this case (i) the source is reliable and (ii) it indicates the seriousness with which she is taken.  See comments on journals elsewhere. \n\nB: it does not indicate the seriousness with which she is being taken. if it were more serious, bill would not use the phrase \"limited understanding\". the tone is full of vitriol, not professionalism. \n\nA: There are plenty of legitimate sources that criticize her. Let's stick to those. \n\nB:  The use of the term \"vitriol\" is arrant nonsense.  However I am open to an equivalent source which deals with her reading on Kant.  We have here a reputably philosopher, addressing (largely with dismissal) a core aspect of her approach.   That is important.  If you have another CoM, happy to consider it. \n\nA: I don't mind his \"dismissal\". Rand rarely appears to seem to know what she is talking about (much like me). But the word \"understanding\" is  as i have said several times  is not an objective term. this is one scholar making an inference. if someone came up with one scholar that says she is a philosopher it would be dismissed as a matter of weight. i think her \"lack of understanding\" should be dismissed as a matter of weight unless you can come up with many scholars that say the exact same thing. particularly since it is an inference. - oh that's right, you don't take me seriously anyway. so just fuck off and ignore this post. \n","14":"A: == Please do not delete material from article Talk pages ==\n\n\nB: With external_link, you deleted (rather than archived) a discussion from the wiki_link Talk page, which external_link WP:Talk.  Please don't do that anymore. (In fact, since among the comments you deleted were some that were only a few hours old, it would not have been appropriate even to archive them.) \n\nA: My understanding is that it is totally appropriate and even reasonable to userfy or delete offtopic discussions or SOAPbox rants. Thanks. \n\nB: Please read wiki_link  wiki_link is '''''NOT''''' the place for wiki_linkboxing against SCOTUS's interpretation of the Establishment Clause. \n","15":"A: == Fictional Multiverses ==\n\n\nB: I notice that you and I have been going back and forth on the Fictional Multiverses section of the Multiverse page. I'm wondering exactly what your problem is with what I am writing. All I am doing is trying to make sure that Marvel Comics gets some mention (preferably equal coverage) on the topic of comic book multiverses. I even took out unnecessary information and replaced it with a link to another page about it the specific topics. Could you please talk to me about WHY you keep deleting any mention of Marvel comics? If you have a problem with WHAT I wrote, surely you can come up with something better (or some improvement on my writing) that talks about how Marvel uses the concept of the Multiverse. \n\nA: I direct your attention to the two templates that I had placed on this section: wiki_link: Your additions (like the rest of this section) are unsourced, in violation of wiki_link. wiki_link: \"An article about a nonfiction topic should only contain fictional references of historic importance so as to not overshadow the main topic.\" None of your additions (nor any of the other contents of this section) is of even the ''slightest'' \"historic importance\"  they are mere fan trivia. I am therefore deleting the entire section. If you want to write about fictional parallel universes, you are welcome to do so in the appropriate article: wiki_link. \n\nB: I'm just trying to be fair here, you're suggesting that I not add to an article without citing, etc.   Well, how about you not DELETE AN ENTIRE SECTION without first discussing it. You've done that twice now. All I want you to do is (a) NOT DELETE THE ENTIRE SECTION, fictional multiverses do need some mention, and there is nothing wrong with the way there were mentioned before you deleted it, hence, I undid what you did and (b) talk this through, perhaps come up with some compromise about what to do. As I mentioned before Wikipedia prefers that information be presented poorly rather than not at all. So perhaps we can find a better way to CONTINUE presenting the information in a better way, because this back and forth between you and I is getting really ridiculous. And I don't want some bull about you sending me to WIKIPEDIA GUIDES, I've read them and know what they say. I read them way before you pointed them out and way before I edited the section. I still think the information contained within the section is pertinent to the situation, what problem do you have with the article discussing at the end a few paragraphs on multiverses in fiction, explicitly stating not only at the section header but also within the section itself that it's fiction. Everything I said was true, I even took out the things I said that would have needed references, basically all that is stated within these paragraphs is that the concept of the multiverse is used and, in some cases, how. Why do you insist on making this a big deal? Do you have some sort of personal vendetta against me for undoing your revisions? Keep in mind that WIKIPEDIA isn't yours, it's everybody's and you don't get to make all the big decisions, if you want to make a change this drastic you should discuss it with some other users first, rather than just doing it. And considering I seem to be the only user who cares enough to do something about it, don't you think you should discuss this rationally before doing something like this. \n\nA: Look, I don't know if you get it, but AS I KEEP MENTIONING, I would like to discuss this before you do anything drastic YET AGAIN. And yes, the Official Handbook does indeed count as a source, apparently you didn't check, or care to check, out the source. Also, it is a work in progress, I will eventually fill out the sources more thoroughly, and will continue to restore the section no matter how many times you delete it. So, until you're willing to discuss this before deleting it again, I will see you then. \n\nB: All this because I won't let you insert your Marvel fancruft trivia into a serious science article. You are being ''utterly'' ridiculous. \n","16":"A: == Never seen this before, you might find it interesting ==\n\n\nB: I've never seen wiki_link kind of reaction to an editor (but I don't spend much time on AN\/I).  Inspectre could do with some similar attention perhaps. \n\nA: Inspectre is nowhere near as aggressive as 'Abuse truth', so is unlikely to warrant similar treatment. To be honest, I don't think he has any real expectation of changing the article, but most probably gains masochistic pleasure from being a martyr for his cause. I wonder if there's a \"help, help, I'm being repressed\" template (with a pic of wiki_link as his anarcho-syndicalist peasant character from wiki_link). Given that Inspectre is almost certainly Cameron Wybrow, external_link may give some background (Denyse O'Leary, if you haven't encountered her already, is a prolific, if ignorant and much-derided, Canadian professional pro-ID blogger). ERV in turn external_link. \n\nB: Please stop deleting appropriate external links to Wikipedia, as you did to Creation-evolution controversy.

All we want is a good article about Malia.  I've written in ANI about why she is notable, even those oppose admit she is \"marginally notable\".  Try to suggest that Mrs. Obama gets her fame from Barack and see how far that bad logic takes you. \n\nA: Haha.  Is it time to delete Laura Bush now too?  I think its appropriate for a separate Malia Obama article, and it will inevitably be its own article sooner or later.  I'll chime in on the ANI; I was told before that Deletion Review is where this would need to go.  If it goes to DRV now, its quite possible that the editors who are in favor of the redirect will skew the view of consensus (not because of any bad motive, mind you, but just from being more invested at this point contributing and defending their views).  When Wikipedia has a gap like this, typically the article keeps getting recreated by less-frequent contributors who can't believe there isn't one, and eventually it sticks.  So over time, the system sorta works. \n\nB: Thank you for your answer.  ANI has decided that BLP\/N is the correct forum and that people should not remove it there. As stated in the unprotect column (re-listed), there is every reason to have it and the only reason not to is \"WP:IDONTLIKEIT\".  It is hypocracy to allow Bo but not Malia.  Malia does more than eat, unlike Bo. \n","19":"A: == November 2009 ==\n\n\nB: Please do not use talk pages  for general discussion of the topic.

These prevented things like \" John XXII\" and \"2 November\" breaking at their spaces at the end of lines. I understand these uses are recommended on wiki_link. Another editor disagreed and kept reverting my edits. I can understand people not thinking this is absolutely necessary and may not wish to spend time on it when editing but why remove what is only a (small) improvement? With the use of smaller screens now on tablets and smartphones there is far more likelihood of lines breaking at confusing places so more NBSPs in these appropriate places are becoming even more useful. I welcome discussion and await some form of consensus. \n\nA: Because it wasn't an improvement at all? \n\nB: The point you seem to have missed, Eric, is that I was replacing the NBSPs that were in the article when it was FA reviewed, but Ohconfucius arbitrarily removed on 1 Sep.  I did add acouple of extras to help for the reasons above. What is your problem with that? \n\nA: The point ''you'' seem to have missed is that nbsps were unnecessary. \n\nB: Have you read wiki_link ? Just because something is not ''necessary'' does not mean it is not ''useful'' or ''helpful''. What's your problem? \n\nA: Let's face the facts.

I don't know why they're so vehement about being right or wrong, it's just a photo.  I will continue the discussion on commons, but I suspect it will be deleted as there seems to be 3 independent copyright claims and none of them state free use. \n\nA: None of them states free use?

The NPOV policy lays down that facts about opinion are acceptable, but only where authoritative individuals or clearly defined populations holding those opinions can be identified, and even then, they should only be represented giving due weight to the size of those populations. Much of what is in the article currently is clearly opinion rather than fact.

It has to do with the split-U logo, which is called \"The U\". The school is called \"The U\". The sports community refers to it as \"The U\". Even forgetting the single hit on the school's website for \"The U.S. State Dept\", the use of \"The U\", even in quotations of faculty\/staff or on the website itself, shows the pervasiveness of the name. \"The U\" may be an abbreviation for \"The University\" but that does not in any way mean that every school known as \"The University of...\" is \"The U\". Only a few are referred to as such. \"The U\" is an informal name, just like any alias for any major university. Researchers from wiki_link do not introduce themselves as being from \"NC State\" as far as I am aware.

I would appreciate if you stopped reverting me for the sake of reverting me to make a point about my previous activities, as you clearly state here. And I also '''never''' stated anything of that sort. You are putting words in my mouth at this point.\u2014 \n\nB:  I assure you that I am not \"reverting [you] for the sake of reverting [you].\"  The history of the institution does not have to be tied to different Presidents and their priorities.  This is apparently a matter of writing style.  Flow is not as important in a history section as is the overall organizing principle, in this case chronological. : Rather than engage in an edit war over what is obviously inaccurate information, I have moved the history section to  and suggest we forge a consensus there. \n\nA: There is no fucking inaccurate information. Stop screwing with the page.\u2014 \n","46":"A: == Hud? ==\n\n\nB: Could it be a clever ref to wiki_link or Heads Up Display, considering how the film looks it is very plausible  \u2014Preceding wiki_link comment added by That's what I was thinking.  After all, the movie is like a first-person shooter, but without the gun (fyi I thought it was a good movie). : I think he was referring to how many cameras have a sort of HUD.  \u2014Preceding wiki_link comment added by \n\nA: That thought crossed my mind as soon as I heard the name. Maybe it is, or maybe it's just an outlandish New York nickname. \n\nB: put it under some kind of trivia or notes section. \n\nA: NO.  This is all just speculation and fanwankery, and does not belong in an encyclopedia article. - \n","47":"A: ==Lindsay Lohan==\n\n\nB: How come no one has mentioned that Lindsay Lohan is in the film?  \u2014Preceding wiki_link comment added by \n\nA: Because she is not. | \n\nB: I believe he is calling LL a monster.  \u2014Preceding wiki_link comment added by \n\nA: That's dumb. | \n","48":"A: == Global warning (sic) ==\n\n\nB: Thank you for your kind reminder that the GW article is under article probation. I wonder if you could let be know whether this probation applies equally to AGW believers and AGW sceptics.  I notice that the greatest contributor to the section 'Climate history destroyed' after the archiving is yourself. I presume that it is my contribution to this section that prompted your message. \n\nA:  It applies to all editors.  As I've noticed you around editing on global warming matters I thought I'd notify you, as I've notified other editors who in my estimation might not know of the probation or might not be aware that it applies to a particular article they have edited. \n\nB: So it is just a global warning. \n\nA: Yep, TS has been doing a commendable job making sure that everyone is aware of the probation and logging it in wiki_link. So TS - consider yourself commended. - \n\nB: I'm OK with you re-factoring my TalkPage, but if you're going to do that, I think I should insist you put a stop to the re-factoring that goes on at other TalkPages, much of which reflects really badly on the articles where it's going on. \n\nA:  If you're referring to my changing the inflammatory and misleading name of a discussion section you added to wiki_link today, I'm sorry I cannot comply.  Don't throw around these accusations.  If you have problems with the conduct of some editors, pursue wiki_link. \n\nB: I cannot take anything to dispute resolution without attempting to resolve it directly with a posting to an editors TalkPage. But I'd be very reluctant to start a fight, since you're the only vested editor I can see who has been attempting to help with the science. \n","49":"A: == GMT\/UTC ==\n\n\nB: Feel free to revert me, the only reason I did it was for clarification for people that may not realise the two are the same, since UTC is used on Wikipedia. -) \n\nA:  It is?  Oh I think I must have always silently translated it to \"GMT\". \n\nB: Although \"wiki_link\" is sometimes interpreted as being adjusted for daylight savings, and UTC is never adjusted. - \n\nA:  Read that section again.  Only an idiot would interpret GMT as subject to daylight savings. It's based on the mean time the sun is at its zenith on the Greenwich meridian. \n","50":"A: == Spoiler conflict ==\n\n\nB: (removed silliness) \n\nA:  I'm not following this.  As an Arbitration clerk I have to maintain some distance from affairs that come up on wiki_link. \n\nB: (removed sillines) \n","51":"A: ==Trolling over signatures==\n\n\nB: What you wrongly call trolling I call a move of solidarity. You were in the wrong, accept it and move on. The user and myself are under no obligation to remove any images from signatures that are not disruptive.   external_link \n\nA:  Should you persist, I think you'll find that your perception of the situation is somewhat awry. I'll assume for the moment that you're too bright to push the envelope. \n\nB: That wasn't condecending. And for the record, you cannot object to the image in my signature as there is no solid basis for it in policy or guidelines beyond that you don't like it, which last time I checked isn't a valid reason to remove it. Have a nice day.   external_link \n\nA: That's rubbish.  If your signature or the way in which you use it should become disruptive, nobody needs to be able to point to a specific line that says \"JohnnyBGood isn't allowed to have a stupid signature\" to ask you to knock it off and, should you continue trolling, block you. \n","52":"A: == Unprotection of [WIKI_LINK: Freemasonry] ==\n\n\nB: I wanted to point out that I disagree with your unprotection of wiki_link, and why.  Yes, this is a wiki, but the original intent of protecting the page was to leave it as such pending arbitration resolution.  We've in fact already had anonymous vandalism external_link, less than ten hours after it was unprotected. \n\nA: Hey MSJapan, I don't know if you noticed, but the injunction against Lightbringer went into effect a few days ago. As that edit war was the reason for protection, it should now be safe. If Lightbringer violates the injunction (on any freemasonry-related page, and under any account or IP) then report it and measures will be taken. But I think the article is okay unprotected for now. Sorry, to barge in, Tony. \u00b7 \n\nB: Whatever, I wouldn't support an arbcom injunction to ''protect'' an article, excepting strong external (ie legal) implications, and then I'd expect the injunction to come from the Foundation.  This is indeed a wiki. \n","53":"A: ==Request==\n\n\nB: Would you mind writing up a short summary of what you feel you learned\/what the consensus was of the RfC?  I feel there is the possibility that further action might be needed, but I think it would be helpful for the community to hear what you think of what has transpired, whether you feel anything will change\/is in need of changing, etc.   Thanks. \n\nA:  Read my response to the RfC and the outside views that I endorsed. \n\nB: I did, the results are rather unclear, and it appears as if you take the entire thing lightly.  I'm hoping this is not the case.  It would help matters in the community greatly if you would write a short summary of the entire process. \n\nA:  Read them again.  I have no intention of writing a precis. \n\nB: Unless you expect us to be mind readers Tony, we can't divine your true thoughts.  Why you are being so unhelpful and arrogant? \n","54":"A: == page protection ==\n\n\nB: I am willing to unprotect if I have any reason to believe that this war will end.  Since I locked it on Mike's version (arbitrarily) can he provide some support for his version? \n\nA: Well, thanks for protecting it to avoid ()'s vandalism. He\/she kept removing the part that is in red: . The user has been slightly reported to ' talk page to see if he could ban the user or not.   | \n\nB: I realise that. My question is, can you track down a source for that? If you can, this is simple to resolve.  If you can't, it's more problematic. \n\nA: Unfortunately, Mr. Garcia is once again the major cause of the problem, even though he's the one who's appealing for assistance here.  While this time (unlike some of his earlier edit wars) he actually had some other users supporting his side (in fact, the version of the text being warred over now is actually the one written by me, as a more NPOV version of Garcia's original edit, which he apparently accepts but his opponents do not), he continues to use edit comments of a nature that tend to alienate even his supporters.  He tells people to \"go away\" as if he thinks he owns the article, and he uses obscenities.  Thus, whether he's right or wrong on this particular case, he seems to be the one most likely to get banned if the site's \"authorities\" pay attention to what is happening here. \n\nB: I'm protecting this page again.  Despite the fact that the combatants were blocked, the war has re-started.  I don't see any other option. \n","55":"A: == Hypnotize \/ Mezmerize album changeup ==\n\n\nB: Just because Mike Garcia believes this to be true does not mean it should be in the article. I follow SOAD news very carefully and this has never been an issue, let alone being a confirmed fact as Mike Garcia seems to think it is. I would like to see a source or have this deleted. \n\nA: You need to learn how to stop removing it and if you do it again I have no choice but to report you or ask  if he could ban you from this. Also, I can't keep on reverting you from this due to the 3 revert rule.   | \n\nB: Why do you refuse to address the issue? \n\nA: Who cares about your idea? I don't deal with number IP address users who are about to be banned (like you). Just give it up with the changing shit.   | \n","56":"A: == Please do not blank factural information ==\n\n\nB: Please do not remove factural information and references from the article wiki_link. Please pay attention that any information ypou add should be confirmed by creadible sources. Original research or your privat opinion is not appropriate for the Wikipedia articles. \n\nA: I only removed dubious information and explained everything at talk. Please respond there, if you disagree. \n\nB: Your personal taste is not the reason to classify the information as dubious. You have to provide creadible sources confirming it. You did not do it, did you? \n","57":"A: == Please don't misinform other users by the comments to your edits ==\n\n\nB: I would like to poin out once more that your comments misinform the Wikipedia users. There is actibe discussion going on at wiki_link. Consensus is not reached yet. Why do you lie saying \"restoring consenus\" replaced the article by your extremely biased, Russian Orthodox POV version? If you agree abot something with Ghirlandajo, Kuban Kazak or alike, this is not a consensus yet. Pay attention to other user's opinion. Or you just like the edit war? \n\nA: I don't like edit wars. There seems to be a consensus at talk judging by number of people, who view lack of canonicity of UOC-KP relevant. \n\nB: Stop lying! Everybody can external_link that your also removed the information about dubious canonicity of Moscow Patriarhate in Ukraine. This information was proposed by another user, not by me. At least one more user was supporting us. Where did you see the consensus? You just lie barefaced and shameless. \n","58":"A: == What is this? ==\n\n\nB: What is external_link? I have a right to remove content I added to an article, since no one else has contributed significantly to it. Please revert yourself. \n\nA: Why? You don't own the article. The information is relevant and properly cited, so there's no reason to remove it. Is there some guideline\/policy that says you alone decide what belongs or does not belong in the article? \n\nB: There is a guideline (or at least one time there was) that says an author has the right to blank what they have written. \n\nA: Nope, not in the mainspace.  Once it's there, it's there.  GFDL and all that. \n","59":"A: ==Stalking, Part 2==\n\n\nB: Okay, I have warned you before about the stalking, but it doesn't seem to have had any effect.  I suggest you stop ''now'' because I really don't want to have to make a complaint against you. \n\nA: \"Proper use of an editor's history includes (but is not limited to) fixing errors or violations of Wikipedia policy or correcting related problems on multiple articles.\" \u2014From wiki_link, which you linked to above. \n\nB: That's not what you've been doing.  All you are doing is following me round the biography articles - it's very clear that you just go to my contributions list and look to see what biography articles I've worked on, then you go and look to see if you can find something wrong with them.  And in fact, you admitted above that you only de-link dates when you feel like it.  While we're about it, if you insist on replying on ''your'' talk page instead of mine, please place a note on mine to say that you've done so - so that I don't have to keep looking at your page to see if you've replied. \n\nA: So, what is wrong with fixing things? At the top of my talk page, it says to keep it on your watchlist. \n\nB: You cannot possibly be too stupid to understand the warning I'm giving you.  I'm not going to repeat it. \n","60":"A: == Claim that early Iranians \"settled\" in Khuzestan ==\n\n\nB: SC, that's just plain wrong. The technology that led to the expansion of the Indo-European languages is believed to have been horse-drawn chariots used in warfare. The originators were peoples of the steppe, and the technology, and associated language, seems to have spread from the steppes down into the Afghan plateau (per Witzel) and thence into India and Persia. The Medes and Persians seem to have been peoples of the central Iranian plateau, speaking Proto-Iranian languages, and from ''there'' spreading down the Karun valley into the Mesopotamian plains. They didn't \"settle\" in Elam  they conquered it! You've distorted history to make a nationalist point. I don't think that you'll find ANY historian who would, or would have, endorsed your version. \n\nA: Zora, can you provide us with a specific passage from a source that says they were \"conquered\"? I'd be interested in that. Thanx. \n\nB: Firstly they did settle, because waves of Aryans were observed into the pre-Indo-European societies there. Then other waves came and settled, before the third overran the area. \n","61":"A: == Proposal ==\n\n\nB: The Human Rights section is too similar to the wiki_link entry. I proposed merging the content with this entry. \n\nA: Please excuse my ignorance but what is this mention of \"Ahwazi\" in the article? I have never heard Arabs here call themselves Ahwazi, just Arab. Also, why no mention of Persians and Lor and others who are also poor and being displaced by rich people? \n\nB: The wiki_link refers to a UNCHR report on the forced confiscation of land owned by Laks, a Persian tribe, but there is little material available to expand on this. Perhaps you can do some research on this, instead of vandalising articles and complaining about others' work. \n\nA: Also I have read some articles here on Wikipedia, not all, but there is much racism against both Arab and Persian and it would be nice if everyone could stop promoting racism against one group while fighting racism of the other. What government does against Arabs does not mean Iranians are racist against Arabs when same government also forces Persians and others into poverty. Look at the Kurds now - they experienced massacre recently and they are more oppressed and poor than almost everyone except Baluch. \n\nB:  Hajjagha: None of the content I have written has been anti-Persian. In fact, I have been at pains to show that the Arab unrest is not a communal Arab-Persian conflict but related to dissatisfaction with government policy. If there is any anti-Persian racism, please modify the article and change the phrases or insert counter-arguments instead of simply deleting content that others' have spent time working on. \n\nA: Your last sentence above applies to yourself as well. You cant delete info you dont like, supplant it with your own version, and call the opposing version \"persian nationalist\" and \"propaganda\". \n\nB: The parts I deleted were an unsubstantiated rant about ethnicity in Iran in the human rights section. It was little more than propaganda with no attempt to point to secondary material and anyway the English was appalling. I decided to make references to reports by HRW, Amnesty and UNCHR (I don't think these are pan-Arab or anti-Persian organisations), but also added a \"criticism\" section countering human rights allegations. I believe I summarised many of the points made before. But if you would like to expand on this and perhaps give reference to other secondary material substantiating the arguments, then go ahead. You, Zereshk, have made a point about the importance of secondary material to counter 's analysis of Khuzestan's history. I believe I have met the standards of proof you are demanding. But this does not seem to be good enough. \n\nA: If it's bad English, then fix it. That's no reason for deletion. Secondly, youre eclipsing the page with ethno-political material, which was already mentioned in 2 sections in the article, and had its own linked page. Also, your edits were not balanced. Write any anti-Iranian rant you like. But also be fair and write the view of your opposition. I dont see you doing that. You deleted the opposition on dubious reasons. One paragraph against 3 sections? That's biased. Try again please. \n\nB: I did not write any fucking anti-Iranian rant. I wrote about the fucking human rights situation with evidence from human rights organisations, you fuckwit. \n","62":"A: == I Do Not Have All The Details ==\n\n\nB: And I have no desire to get involved, yet I hae noticed that  and  and ''I think''  are having edit wars that have spanned onto 3 talk pages (two of which aren't any of their's).  Not sure what needs to be done but I think it should be taken care of quickly. - \n\nA: I don't have full details either, but I don't think anything beyond warning people against calling each others vandals needs to be done to the editors right now. Perhaps the page might need to be protected if edit warring continues. \n\nB: Oddly enough, it seems these people constantly check their histories.  (At one point I tried to revert some large messy accusations.)  Sorry to have brought this onto your page now. >_< - :::Actually, NOT oddly enough . . . I do that too.  Though not for this. - \n\nA: I'm getting tired of this already. I have protected the article. \n\nB: I apologize if I've gotten you unwillingly involved in this.  I shall now withdraw, log off, and catch some shuteye lest I find ''myself'' involved.  I nearly fell into an edit-war a few days ago and I've no desire to get into this one... - \n","63":"A: == Vandalism? ==\n\n\nB: Doesn't malicious editing and incessent deletion of certain texts from pages construe as vandalism? Universalgenius has been reverting articles to his favor, despite the fact that consensus has been reached in certain matters. That IS vandalism. \n\nA: Looks like a content dispute to me. He can be blocked for disruptive edit warring, but not for vandalism. \n\nB: Block him away then! He needs a lesson! If Aquarelle or me gets blocked, what kind of message are we sending to Wiki editors? \n\nA: The message is \"Edit warring is bad, no matter who is right\". \n\nB: Well, at least protest wiki_link. \n\nA: I have done that already. Did I choose the wiki_link? \n\nB: New developments. Vandal Universalgenius called both me and Aquarelle stupid and childish, while he touts his NPA rules like a evangelical priest. Ban this vandal please. \n","64":"A: == National police of Slovenia??? ==\n\n\nB: ''Kontra\u010deta - The Kontra\u010dete were Anti-Partisan Units controlled by the National Police of Slovenia.'' What is the meaning of ''National police of Slovenia''? There was no Slovenia during WW2, it was occupied and divided among the occupiers. Was that some collaborant police created by Italians? Is there any further link that could shed more light on the matter? \n\nA: One of the users that contributed in the creation of this article made a mistake with this. The Kontraceta unit was created by the Bulgarians during WW2. This data will be adjusted. Regards. \n\nB: Perhaps. The book I cited must be wrong. \n","65":"A: == Recent revisions ==\n\n\nB: Guys, I don't know who originally wrote the following passages (Revizionist?); just wanted to say that these are quite blatantly POV. You can't be serious that this is your best attempt at neutral writing? *''\"the real wiki_link of the ethnic Macedonian conscience and identity occurred between the two world wars, and triumphed during wiki_link\"'' *''\"the wiki_link greater-wiki_link regime in wiki_link was destroying every form of manifestation of wiki_link consciousness\"'' ... and so on, this goes for the whole section of which these sentences were part. I know this article used to have some heavily tendentious pro-Bulgarian material, from the time Jingiby edited it. Now somebody seems to have gone and replaced it with some equally tendentious pro-Macedonian material. That's disappointing. I hope you guys can do better than this. By the way, about the title of the article: \"National Liberation War of Macedonia\" sounds like a term that may be common from the perspective of native RoMac national historiography, but is it commonly used in the international literature? \n\nA: It is Revizionist that added those sentences. I removed all Macedonian and Bulgarian propaganda from the article but he reverts it to his biased and POV version, claiming Bulgarian and Serbian authorities tried to \"assimilate the ethnic Macedonian population\". Not to mention his version of the article is plagued with bad English, grammar, style as well as totaled with redlinks. He has a problem with wiki_link on a number of articles. \n\nB: Hello Future. How are you doing? As you know the articles about ethnic Macedonians were a real mess. I made a revision of the article wiki_link and wiki_link which were approved by the majority as neutral and informative. I only want to finish with the revision of this article (which we all agree was very chaotic. But this can not be done over night. i go to work, and in my free time (when I have some) I go to the library and read material, take notes, afterwards I translate them. It is a process. First I must finish inputing data (which as you see is informative - for example when which unit was formed, when it was destroyed and so on). The user  is reverting all my revisions (although I added 65% new text to the article). I must finish adding, afterwards I will improve the English, and afterwards we will adjust or exclude the things that according to the majority is not neutral. You know that I always make quality contributions. Don't worry, let me finish it and afterwards we will all together make a great neutral article, and maybe recommend it for an wiki award. Cheers. \n\nA: Nothing is more encyclopedia-worthy than my version of the article. Just because you wrote 65% of the article doesn't mean you own it (wiki_link), I placed a template there saying that it would be revamped and you may help \"expand\" it, but instead, you wish to revert my edits because you contributed a bunch of lousy propaganda and images. \n\nB: As we said - no problem, include the things you think should be included, but incorporate them into my revision. The data I imputed is informative. I mentioned all of the detachments that were formed in 1942, and their battles. After that the formation of the CPM, data about the Vardar Chetnik Corps, and about the colaborationist organizations. I will also include these days data about the February Campagn, the Spring offencive, about the Otechestven Front and the contribution of the Bulgarian Otechestven Front in the liberation of eastern Vardar Macedonia. What can be more objective than that. We are not on a race. The article was chaotic for more than 2 years. I am separating great amount of my free time to improve the article. Do include your contributions to the article, but do not erase 65% of it to do that. Regards. \n\nA: You have no authority to tell me what to do. Your version of the article just flat out sucks, ''you'' add stuff to ''my'' revision. \n","66":"A: == Proposal to merge Prehistoric Spain with Prehistoric Portugal & move to Prehistoric Iberia ==\n\n\nB: Currently, the text of ''wiki_link'' seems really to be about prehistoric Iberia.  Similarly, the text of ''wiki_link'' seems really to be about the same thing.  This would be perfectly understandable seeing as there was no Spain and no Portugal in prehistoric times. I have argued therefore that it would be best to have these articles merged under a title which indicates the geographical region rather than the modern states.  I have proposed the articles be merged and moved to ''wiki_link''.  Please wiki_link my proposal. wiki_link \n\nA: Hello Jim. If the merge goes through, what shall we do with wiki_link? You see, wiki_link encompasses a period that the \"Portuguese\" articles differentiated into wiki_link and wiki_link. Should we merge them all? \n\nB: I think a single Prehistoric Iberia makes a lot of sense -  merge them all! \n","67":"A: == 2nd biggest? ==\n\n\nB: The article says it's the 2nd biggest peninsula in Europe, after the Balkan. What about Scandinavia? \n\nA: the 2nd biggest of the ''three southern european'' peninsulas \n\nB: The article doesn't say southern, it says \"It is the second biggest peninsula of Europe (after the Balkan peninsula) with an area of 582 860 km\u00b2.\" \n\nA: Dude are you blind? \n","68":"A: == contact ==\n\n\nB: sorry for a non-article question, but do any of you know how to contact Sakurai?

Is the italicized text yours or CoM's? Thanks. \n\nA: He created the RFC with the sentence \"I think he's awesome!!!\" I noticed from the ANI thread I just closed that it was a bluelink, so I clicked on it, and when I saw that I deleted it. The entire message is from me to CoM, italicized by Twinkle because I entered it into the comment box when adding the template. (I've never subscribed to to the idea of wiki_link) . \n\nB: Thank you for the answer. \n","71":"A: == Usernames ==\n\n\nB: Be careful about deleting things. You accidentally deleted the next person on the list external_link. \n\nA: Yea, I realized that when I pasted it into the holding pen, but  you were so quick it was already fixed when I came back, good save. \n\nB: No problem, thanks. I had it on my watchlist and I've found that I'm starting to get rather fast at it. Scarily fast. It's a result of clicking the watchlist button every two seconds. \n\nA: I'm not removing it ok please don't edit my user and user talk page you have no business to do that.    \u2014Preceding wiki_link comment added . == I'm not removing it\" \n\nB: You are very quickly moving towards a block. Any user may send messages to any other user's talk page, and no user is allowed to remove a deletion discussion template from a page while the discussion is still underway. \n\nA: I'm about to comment on the MfD. Am I allowed to suggest a block there? \n\nB: I gave them a \"last warning,\" if they vandalize one more time, I'd say report to ANI AIV. I probably shouldn't block them myself because I'm \"involved.\" \n\nA: That's why I was asking about suggesting it on the MfD. I'm involved now too. \n\nB: They just removed the mfd tag again, I reported them at wiki_link \n\nA: (sighs) How is it possible for one person to have so much stupidity in them as to ignore fifty million rapid-fire warnings? \n","72":"A: == [WIKI_LINK: File:Browning M2HB .50-caliber.jpg] ==\n\n\nB: US Government websites not only host government created works - see the disclaimers for defenseimagery.mil or army.mil. Per the EXIF, and maybe per the description in the past, this photgraph was not taken by an US employee but an Australian soldier and is not public domain per  or similar licenses like PD-USGov-Military-Navy\/Army. \n\nA: If it is published by a federal entity, is it not PD? \n\nB: The template even says it is public domain because it was created by an US employee - nothing else matters.

Lastly, name callings of your fellow editor will lead you to nowhere in terms of AGF, you should know that since you're a seasoned editor. Why can't you have the courtesy of thinking that other editors are here to help improve the article? Other than the obvious vandalism edits, why is it that you always think of the worst of others. Have you forgotten that Wikipedia is a collabarative effort? I won't mince my word but you really ought to be ashame of yourself! ''  '' \n\nA: Who are you and why do you appear when I find myself embroiled in conflict with someone else only to oppose me for the sake of confronting me? I'm beginning to think this is no longer a bizarre coincidence. My frustration stems mostly from the fact that 99% of the editors DO NOT improve the article, but instead, whether it be good intentions or not, tear away at it piece by piece. Have you noticed that there hasn't been any significant CONTENT or cited material contributed apart from my work? Take a look through the history.

It shows they had 3 disco #1's and rest top 5 which is never talk about anywahere. The thing is this artcale saids basically the 70's line-up was struggling. Yes in terms of R&B; and Pop in 1973 and onward but in Disco they had great success and should be noted on this artcle that they were succelful in Disco and had 3 #1 Disco hits. Also that the 2 line-ups found new success in Disco and had and that that they regained some of their fame in the form of the Disco hits. I am also edditing the top samples things and including the songs in the 70's that wer top 10 Disco and will provide a sample of them soon, Thank you, Saimaroimaru_2008. \n\nA: Well I perceive to think that the reason why it was taken out because there's too much chart info. You can mention the songs hitting the top ten\/number-one spot on the now-vacant Billboard disco singles chart. If you wanna put all the chart information from all Supremes songs from various charts, it'll be better to post it on their wiki_link page than on the main article, just saying, you know? \u00a0\u00a0'''\u00b7''' ::LOL, well, it's there anyway, I had to correct a few things since you probably was the one who put \"1975\" at the end of every track, lol. \u00a0\u00a0'''\u00b7''' ::Also, not every one of the disco singles they put out came out in '75. LMAO! \u00a0\u00a0'''\u00b7''' \n\nB: I undertsand the Disco charts are gone but its apart of their legacy wether we like it or not. Its a crime to not tell poeple the whole truth when its there to put up, part of remembering them and honoring these great singers is to put up all of their history not just one era of their music. I understand its a lot of info to add but The Supremes had a lot of top  10 hits and the chances of a consertive supremes fans going to the discography is 3 of 7 and they mainly just look at the 60's part of it. ::Let me see. Oops guess I rushed when I was typing it. Thanks for putting the right year lol. I agree its their decision but they won't even have the choice if they don't know its there, thus a reason to include the 70's top10 and plus I added in some 60's top 10 that you forgot on singles and albums as you see. \n","75":"A: == Legacy section ==\n\n\nB: I do wish whoever is deleting this section would stop doing so or at least discus it first. It's a perfectly reasonable contribution. : I don't see why the word 'probably' is inappropriate. It's a well known fact that far more records were sold in the 1960s than now so it is an intelligent, reasonable thought. \n\nA: It's not reasonable, as it's unreferenced speculation. \"''Probably'' still the most successful girl group of all time in terms of actual records sold?\" That's not encyclopedic. ::No, it's not a well-known fact. That section shouldn't be put in without a reference and better, more solid language. Encylcopedias don't deal with \"probables\" and \"maybes\". They deal with factual information. Unless you have sales records to directly compare Supremes record sales with Destiny's Child or whoever records sales (and trust me, you don't - no one has those both the people at Universal Music, because Motown didn't release them to the RIAA or anyone else) you don't have facts. You're making presumptions based upon your perception that more records were sold in the 1960s than today, and the word \"probably\" is always dangerous to use in an encyclopedia, unless it comes from someone being quoted about a subject. \n\nB:  Well I can't help it if you are ignorant FuriousFreddy. \n","76":"A: == A tricky question of \u201cmyth\u201d ==\n\n\nB: Hi Lulu, I am getting in contact with you after noting your contribution to the neutral point of view policy article and have done this due to an issue that I\u2019ve raised in the talk page of another article that may require outside help to resolve. The discussion has now stretched way beyond 10,000 words (with me providing more than my share) and that has made its way past a wiki_link.  I guess it all depends whether the following issue is one, time permitting, with which you would like to become involved. I\u2019ve raised issue regarding the title of the article \u201cCreation myth\u201d after seeing the talk page notice which claimed: The article title adheres to the wiki_link policy... .  I did not think that this was the case and began the related wiki_link.  It\u2019s got quite a charged on both sides at times and, amongst other things, I\u2019ve taken the view that some of the editors may want to bring the issue to a swift conclusion.  A full review of all the issues mentioned would be appreciated but, not knowing when you may see this message or which other editors may have taken an interest in this topic, it may be worthwhile to make an initial check of the current state of the discussion so as to check the current state of the debate. I do not personally hold any religious faith and yet considered the neutrality issues that I perceived to have been raised by the article title to be worth tackling,  I realise that this is an issue that I have personally raised and, finally, I don\u2019t have any expectation of outside involvement and just mention this in case this issue may also be of interest for you. regards \n\nA: I am not quite sure what you are requesting, exactly, nor what particular expertise you think I have.  However, glancing at the discussion on wiki_link, it appears to me that the title is neutral and correct, and a move to \"Account of creation\" would introduce wiki_link phrasing in place of the commonly used and accepted anthropological and literary-theory term. It appears you might be unfamiliar with the scientific use of the term \"myth\" and misread it as meaning something like \"untrue story\" instead.  However, even the introduction to the article seems to give a rather good definition of this accepted scientific usage, so that would be a good start. \u00d7 \n\nB: Heya, i edite the Argumentum ad Hitler page to include a reference for its use in Latin America (specifically Puerto Rico) I saw that the Spanish page for the article was too short for it to be worthwhile posting it there. \n","77":"A: == Just so you know II ==\n\n\nB: You're being discussed here: \n\nA: Apparently I am being discussed there as well, but no such courtesy was afforded ''me''. \n\nB: Yeah, the anonymous socks are pretty free ranging in the topics they touch on in the random ANI blather.  I rather wonder exactly ''who'' 64- is.  It is evident that it is some editor that I have encountered many times over the years, given its familiarity with various edit questions spanning that time.  Whether it is an editor who is otherwise blocked or banned, I am not quite sure (I have some hunches, but mostly I've forgotten most of the dozens of blocked editors who have pushed various partisanship on pages I've edited). \u00d7 \n\nA: I've proposed a non-punitive solution at wiki_link. Please review and comment. Thanks .... \n\nB: It sounds like it would be a good thing if you would join your drawer-mate 64.208.230.145 in creating  (and sticking) to a named account for your edits rather than trying to hide behind however many IPs you edit under.  FWIW, it also might be worth looking up the term \"non-punitive\", since you seem to have mistaken its meaning.  Maybe even go make a constructive edit somewhere in article space to round out the whole \"positive direction\" theme on ANI. \u00d7 \n\nA: Editors in good standing with thousands of quality edits to our name, and ''we're'' the ones getting shit on by a couple of anonymous SPA-like IPs. I've been minding my own business for months, and then this \"64\" decides to call me an \"attack dog\" at wiki_link. Anonymous liars don't deserve courtesy or apologies from us. Ignore 71's ludicrous nonsense. \n","78":"A: == Ben 10 Alien Force aliens ==\n\n\nB: I have some names of the new Ben 10 Alien force aliens.  Would you like for them to be mentioned?  And while I'm at it, some of the toys have facts about the planets that each of the aliens come from.  Would you like that source of information as well?  Thank you. \n\nA: Not yet. Wait for the series to actually air on TV... - \n\nB: Yeah...i already got the lecture above...I personally think that the 10 new guys should be added. \n\nA: If\/when they appear named on cartoon network's website, or another reliable source (NOT a fan-site), then they could go in, if this happens before the show airs. Remember, the threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth. See Wikipedia:Verifiability \n\nB: I found the website, it's ben10.com. It will redirect you to the Alien Force website. \n\nA:  Yes, and it's in the main article. But it doesn't name the aliens on there, so it isn't relevant for this one \n\nB: What about Ben10-toys.net? they have images too and the names. \n\nA: I'm just not sure it's reliable. I'm pretty sure the info is right, but again, Wikipedia is about what is verifiable. This is an encyclopaedia, not a news source. \n\nB: So, we're going to wait until the series comes out and shows the aliens? \n\nA: Not necessarily, just needs to come from a reliable source, like the ben10.com\/cartoon network source you found. Or when the toys actually are available to buy i guess. \n\nB: Well, hopefully with the AF sneak peek we're getting, we'll FINALLY beable to add them! I don't see how the toys aren't reliable enough... \n","79":"A: ==Can we?==\n\n\nB: We now know of the AF aliens, can we get them on here? \n\nA:  Is this knowledge properly sourced?

How is that not proof? \n\nB: There is absolutely NOTHING to say about them right now. Wait until the series begins. I don't care if this person has \"connections\" or not. - \n\nA: How is there NOTHING to say? We know what they look like, and that they'll be appearing in Alien Force. We also know a great deal of info on AF. We should get a seperate article for the AF series. We know the main plot, characters, etc. Unless we get a seperate page for the AF aliens, they need to be added here. \n\nB: You want to list them like the others. There is nothing to say in that format. Our option right now is for a paragraph like the Unseen forms section. Nothing more until it airs. - \n\nA: Ok, i'll deal with that. I was surprised that there was no section for them, so kept adding a section for them. I'll change it to just a paragraph about them in a few min. I hungry now... \n\nB: Alright, fine. Now, you also can't just plop a link in there and say this is the source. You have to cite it. - \n\nA: Well, i would've cited it, but, for some reason, whenever i do, i somehow screw stuff up... \n\nB: The IP adresses are adding them again, they've also put them in the same format as the original aliens (with bold headings)! I've deleted them again, there is no information on the website, find another source that tells us about the new aliens then you can add them to the article \n\nA: NO INFO.!? Then you're blind.

I respect the fact that you find it important not to update the article until the team makes it official, but your approach is just not a good one. Instead of repeatedly undoing other editors with either no comments or snide comments, you can work with the editor. How about just putting in the lede that it is reported that.....? How about removing the \"free agent\" status and leaving it empty? How about using hidden comments? How about talking nicely to the editors that you keep on reverting? I imagine lots of editors have been turned off from editing article because some teenager's first foray into Wikipedia - excitedly editing some player that his team got, ran into your unpleasantness.

I primarily mean civil servants rather than political appointees and specifically as part of our responsibility to provide accurate information to the public. We recognize that Wikipedia is a frequent resource for many Internet users, including us. Our log files show that federal websites receive many referrals from Wikipedia. And many of us support and respect the work that the Wikipedia community does to create quality articles. We understand and have studied policies and guidelines, and more than one of us have edited a page or two. I am reaching out to the Wikipedia community to help us develop appropriate guidelines and policies for external_link and our participation. COI guidelines seem to discourage employees from editing on behalf of employers, but we frequently see information that is unclear or sometimes wrong. While we know we can just edit, we want to do so transparently and acceptably. There is concern that we will offend the Wikipedia community and encourage negative attention if we get this wrong. On the other hand, there are great resources in the federal (and state and local) space that would be valuable to Wikipedia users, and we know about them, and can cite them, too. So, what are the best ways for federal employees to contribute to this project? For example, some federal editors will only edit in their official capacity from a government computer with a government IP and from a Wikipedia account. Should that account indicate the name of the agency? Whether it is a communications or a program office? I don't think there would be any controversy on editing dates that are incorrect or improving a reference or correcting an error (like which agency has jurisdiction over an area). Are there things that we ''shouldn't'' edit? For substantive changes, should we be explicit about our roles on talk pages? If we don't get any feedback on proposed changes, how long should we wait until we make the change ourselves? Other ideas\/areas\/pitfalls? The goal is to create guidelines and best practices for the federal web community. We will publish on external_link. I am happy to move this to another area if that makes more sense, and if you want to post comments and discussion on my page, please do. Thanks for your help. \n\nA: Replied over at . Others are welcome to add their own suggestions in that thread. Answering your specific question, I'd say that an employee who is editing an article that relates to what their employer does is strongly advised to give their affiliation when they comment on Talk. (Not their personal identity, just their affiliation). They should also be sure to abide by the advice in wiki_link. Sometimes they may have specialized knowledge due to their work. If so, they should not make changes to articles that are based entirely on personal knowledge; everything should be cited to a published source. \n\nB: Given that most govt employees have the arm of the law behind them, I would say that employees editing from work or home on issues related to their job or employeers need a higher standard of disclosure and should do so only by declaring themselves govt employees, either in signature or in edit summary.  (I personally would like to go further and see their allowed edits ''only'' be to put a tag on information citing the problem with it, leaving any deletion to non-government employees, ''including alleged defamation in Biographies.'' Of course, on the other hand their outing themselves in any case might intimidate others into deleting material that shouldn't be deleted! So any editing of material related to their jobs can be problematic. In any case, I think wiki_link should specifically mention government employees and will discuss at that talk page. Carol Moore \n","85":"A: == \"Hypothetical\" situation ==\n\n\nB: Let's say that a page is created about a certain webcomic. And let's say that this comic is very polarizing, with many people loving it, and many people loving to hate it. Now let's say that this page, after much debate, starts including a section about how what people are saying about the comic( much like the reception section on most articles about movies), and that some people, such as rival webcomics, parody it. Then, along comes a user who defends the comic, and removes much of the criticisms in that section. But then it becomes apparent to people outside of the page that this user is actually the author of this webcomic. But the user is hiding behind the policy on wiki_link, saying that it's against the rules to declare that this user is actually the author of the comic. What can be done about the conflict of interest in this case? \n\nA: If your hypothetical edit should happen to be external_link, I agree with the removal of that particular criticism. Wikipedia does not have an article on the John Solomon of [EXTERNA_LINK: http:\/\/badwebcomics.blogspot.com]. This means he is unlikely to qualify as a well-known expert whose views are citable even when they appear on a blog, which is not normally accepted as a wiki_link. The two other criticisms of the comic, made by people who have articles, have been kept in the article at wiki_link. \n\nB: If your evidence on who the author is on wikipedia is only coming from that encyclopedia drama page then you need to reconsider your evidence. Especialy if you continue to go around spreading your opinions to other editors as you did external_link. Having no evidence, or bad evidence and then going around to everyone and spreading that is not good faith, and is damaging to wikipedia. You cannot go around spreading rumors as fact. \n\nA: If they are complete lies and I look like a total crazy, then Thrindel should not care. He can go on living his life, and dismiss me entirely as an idiot, as can everyone else.

This has followed a lot of back & forth edits and one user (whom I cannot recall) making a logical statement: the sentence as it stood was correct in that all Jewish denominations agreed that a Jew was the child of a Jewish mother or a convert to Judaism - but that, for Reform Jews (as an example), this also included MORE, namely a Jew could be the child of a Jewish father. Therefore, the sentence stood. However, to expand it the way this user has done is to make a claim that mainstream (as opposed to ''traditional'') also has strict rules, etc., and these rules appear to be ''traditional'' ones. Sorry - that is simply not the case. Mainstream denotes most of\/the majority of\/virtually all\/etc. of Judaism, and not just the traditional. If you want to speak about the additional ''rules'', stick that in the traditional section, the same way the progressive ideals of Reform are placed appropriately.  Best, \n\nA: A more neutral way of putting it would be something like: \"All denominations agree that a person may be a Jew either by birth or through conversion.  However, they differ on what these requirements consist of.  The traditional view is that only the child of a Jewish mother is Jewish by birth; some denominations now also allow the child of a Jewish father and non-Jewish mother in certain circumstances.  Denominations also differ on (i) their conversion processes and (ii) whether to recognise conversions performed by other denominations.\"  This is not a draft, just an outline. \n\nB: '''Thank you for that, '''.

When its all said and done, this is something that you have percipitated.I have some papers to write, so I'm not thinking that I can be involved in a project that through editors like yourself, has brought out the very worst in me. Good luck, enjoy your editing, obfuscate the truth, find God and a meaningful purpose for yourself, or whatever makes you happy. \n\nB: Please, the whole \"I'm a victim\" deal is getting incredibly, incredibly old. Can you even provide a place where I reverted one of ''your'' edits for no reason?

The real crying has been by youwith your \"please Mr. Dixie, don't be mean to me\" routine.You are a douchebag. So why don't you put the nozzle back in your buddy's ass? \n","92":"A: == Response to RfC ==\n\n\nB: I have responded to the RfC you raised at wiki_link .  I would appreciate if you read the response.  Thank you. *As I suggested in my response to your RfC: a failure to adhere to Wikipedia:Civility. a failure to adhere to Wikipedia:Talk page guidelines Conduct issues should be discussed of the talk page with the involved editors comments about unspecified editors are unhelpful WP:1RR is a possible solution but as there seems no consensus to use it, 3RR is policy and applies When it comes to keeping on topic and getting bogged down in trivia I suggest using sub-pages. We create a sub-page dedicated to the topic being discussed ... \n\nA: The turmoil sparked by your addition speaks for itself. I note that after prolonged discussion your addition has been found by the wider community to be inappropriate and your actions ill-considered. A good admin wouldn't create such an uproar. \n\nB: and as noted in my response my addition is allowed under wiki_link \n\nA: So it's a policy problem? \n\nB: If you see WP:Bold as a problem, raise it on the policy talk page.  I don't see it as a problem. \n\nA: If you see WP:Bold as a problem, raise it on the policy talk page.  I don't see it as a problem. \n\nB: So, if WP:BOLD isn't the problem, and your edit caused a massive shitfight, apparently still plopping away, then where do you think the problem lies? \n\nA: You didn't mention the material itself, which was of a trivial and poorly sourced nature. Inserting this sort of stuff into an article that has been the scene of bitter controversy, and then edit-warring and stoutly defending it against the advice of several more experienced editors might have something to do with the ruckus? Wouldn't it have been better to gain consensus for inclusion of disputed material, especially when WP:BLP concerns had been raised? \n\nB: Trivial - perhaps but the article is unbalanced in my view and this was only the start of trying to reinsert some balance. Australian Broadcasting Corporation is not usually regarded as a poor source.  You did not have consensus that it violated BLP.  The edit warring that '''breached''' 3RR was your edits.  \"More experienced\" ?   But don't worry - another editor will not be trying to edit that article - success? Your RfC was not about that material alone, it was seeking advice about policy or guidelines to prevent that escalation.  I responded in good faith to your RfC and its purpose, ignoring the personal comments as much as possible and trying hard not to make any irrelevant personal comments myself. An RfC of that nature is not about the material. You needed to raise an wiki_link if you wanted to discuss that material.  I cannot see what the point of that was since it was being discussed on the talk page and had already been raised at BLPN (with no takers). \n\nA: If you seriously hold yourself blameless in all this, I can't see any point in continuing this discussion. \n","93":"A: == Political reverts ==\n\n\nB: Hello Skyring(Pete). I notice you have reverted edits on the Howard article recently. I thought we had all moved away from that kind of mode of editing. Reverts subvert the wishes of the editing community as a whole. It's better to allow the editing community to decide whether content stays or goes. Content disputes need to go through the dispute resolution process. In regard to the particular sentence about public figures who considered Howard's Iraq policy as contravening international laws against war crimes, I've got no idea if the issue gets put to the community to decide whether it would live or die. It could go either way. But then we just have to accept the community decision. The concept is that by letting the community decide, the audience of Wikipedia readers gets the type of encyclopaedia that they want (or deserve). My opinion is that reverting will only lead to trouble. If edit wars break out, then it will only lead to penalties or sanctions against those who partake.'''''' \n\nA: *You know perfectly well the 3RR rule and you have broken it. As an involved editor I will not block you but have reported you.  See wiki_link   . **Please check the number of reverts I did - I don't need a warning - I know and abide by the rules \n\nB: Thanks, Lester! Takes two to edit-war. How come you didn't send the same message to the other side? . Perhaps because they support your POV? You've spent most of your career here edit-warring over trivia and it's hard to take your advice when you don't follow it yourself. \n\nA: LOL! It would help if you checked the discussion on Lester's warnings. Look at the timing of his message above. In any case, I'm removing contentious BLP material, as per discussion, and as per wiki_link. Let's stick to the established process, hey? Do you have a particular urgent need to label someone a war criminal? \n\nB: *I have no need to label anybody a war criminal (urgently or otherwise) - others brought the topic up on the talk page, I thought it fair enough to be included in the article with a reference - note I did not wikilink to war crimes as a topic.  As it is the article is unbalanced with a lack of explanation of his poor polling results or any specifics about criticisms.  We have moved much material to the Howard Government article because that is where it properly goes but there is still much editorial work to bring both articles up to a proper standard with balanced and informed content supported by references.Not sure what the relevance is of the timing of Lester's warning to you - it was before your 3rd reversion.  Don't know why he wrote to Gnangarra - doesn't make sense in the light of Gnangarra's edits on the page which incidentally did not consist of removing the material. I can't comment as to why Lester didn't warn me except that perhaps he knew he didn't need to  - I have NEVER breached 3RR. \n\nA: I can't work out whether you are an idiot or whether you think I am. Just don't try to pull the wool over my eyes. Or anyone else, for that matter. If you genuinely can't understand what's going on, then ask. \n","94":"A: == Geographic databases ==\n\n\nB: Hi Drmies Just wanted to call your attention to wiki_link and the poll therein (there are a couple of relevant discussions at DGG's talk page  and . Hope your summer plans are shaping up nicely. When's your first sabbatical and where are you going to take it? \n\nA: *Hey Bongo! Naw, no fun plans, just teaching a class on modern Western lit.

The kiddos aren't quite old enough for cultural pursuits yet, let alone bike tours, though sounds great. Best. \n\nA: I have a feeling the family is going to have a very hoppy summer, I just put together a 14' trampoline, and we could barely get the little guy off it...I am back to the Gobi, but will be back in NS in time for the Lobster Carnival, I can't wait to see them on the merry-go-round.

Thats like putting the wiki_link as a \"see also\" for the wiki_link??? How are they related besides that they are the same country's? \n\nA: *Well, same country, same island politics, two countries going back and forth over the same terrain, that seems to be a good enough reason. You and SamEV did a pretty good job of tag-teaming, and none of you ever considered to place a welcome template on the IP's user page, or to play nice, or to explain what the issue is. Instead, SamEV starts threatening with \"You may lose your editing privilege if you continue\", and you say \"vandalism\" in one of your edit summaries. None of you thought to explain anything to the IP editornot even wiki_link, which they undoubtedly were guilty of, as are you (you reverted four times). Calm down, take it up with the IP editor, explain that this needs to be addressed on the article talk page, and try to reach consensus. Good luck. \n\nB: **I don't seem to understand you're first sentence, how can anything be looked at in a vacuum? Your use of deductive reasoning doesn't make sense to me in your argument. Anyway, I was also not aware of SamEv's actions in reverting this users edits, yet your mentioning of this lends credence to the fact that the said user is just changing the facts for what ever reason. Yet please accuse away of \"tag-teaming\" with again deducing, when clearly the problem is the IP editor. ***In fact I just took a look at the IP users talk page and it seems that SamEV was already telling him about relevance issues in his links. Oddly thought you support the links? \n\nA: ****I'm sorry if you don't understand my first sentence. I, on the other hand, don't know what you mean with 'vacuum.' I also don't see why the two of you seem to do everything you can to scare off this new editor. I've already cited what SamEV had to say (a rather unfriendly message), so that's not news. The problem is not the IP editor, the problem is that they don't know the rules because no one (that means you and SamEV) bothered to explain those to them. I suggest you read wiki_link carefully, and summarize that behavioral guideline for SamEV on their talk page. ****Oh, and undoing their edits one more time, that is not just asinine, it's also a pretty blatant violation of another rule, which I have already warned you aboutI'll do so now with a template on your talk page. I don't need your response here: if you wish to do anything to improve this, apologize to that IP editor for acting like a jackass and try to explain ''in friendly words'' what you think the problem is. \n","96":"A: ==True Cross==\n\n\nB: I'm glad you noticed that.  I hope I didn't write that, but I may have.... \n\nA: *Oh, my professor had to beat it out of me, so I wouldn't hold it against anyone. Check external_link. Thanks for your note! \n\nB: Very good. The expression in that article seemed rather poor. It might benefit from a general tidy-up, if you have the time. I'd leave it until the other unnamed editor has finished doing their thing. \n","97":"A: == UNK ==\n\n\nB: I was surprised to see you had removed my addition of the UNK particle accelerator in Protvino to the UNK disambig page. Is there a wikipolicy I am missing or what... because I believe a particle accelerator that went into construction (but was never finnished) that would if completed have been on the same size scale as the wiki_link and energy-wise in between the LHC and the wiki_link definitely needs mention. I was in fact schocked to find it was not mentioned anywhere else than on the protvino page. \n\nA: *Gillis, thanks for your question. Well, there are a few problems. First, there is no article for that machine (that's not absolutely mandatory for a dab page, but it helps). Second, there is no reliable source given. Third, the source that was provided doesn't even have the \"UNK\" letter combination in there. Finally, when you simply undid my edit, you also undid valid edits per the Manual of Style. Thanks, \n\nB: **Sorry, but I find your editing style disrespectfull if you can't be bothered to write \"UNK accelerator\" into google and notice this is qutie notable. You might notice the large hadron collider has cost 8 billion to build. This would have been a similar magnitude project. If you look at google scholar you can find several other source about it. Just because I did not put my time into writing a three page article about the damn thing does not constitute you right to *remove* it and is completely against the idea that has built wikipedia, that is to build on many small additions. Please reinstate my changes and leave whatever else you want to have there then. \n\nA: ***Then add a reference to a reliable source. The basic idea here is wiki_link. \n\nB: ****Dude, There was a source that was in fact more of a source than any of the other things in the disambig page.

We are talking about offcial figures here, not your original research. How do you know that there are \"many\" people in your alleged situation? How do we know that you did indeed declare yourself orthodox? Please leave original research and personal feelings aside when contributing here. As for the statistics you provide about church attendance, they come from an obscure poll conducted by an NGO, while the way people define themselves comes from the official census. Most foreigners visiting Romania notice the high church attendance rate (churches are packed and so on). Should the NGO's opinion deserve much space in the article? I believe not. \n\nA: According to the 2002 census, there are no less than 23,105 atheist people in Romania, so we are not talking about \"1 family\" here. This should evidently be included. Additionally, rates of church attendance and \"actual belief\" should also be included aside from census data, since this gives a more complex insight into religion in Romania. The OSF survey that was previously cited is not from an \"obscure NGO\", but rather the wiki_link. This poll is not challenging the census results in any way, because it records an entirely different thing. The census records ''self-identified religion'', while the OSF survey records ''church attendance''. You can still declare a certain religion in the census, and even believe it, but not go to church. They are two different things, and thus not in contradiction with one another. '''''' \n\nB: external_link, there are 9271 self-declared atheists, and a further 13,834 \"without religion\". Those are fairly irrelevant numbers and it's hardly \"evident\" that they should be included, but they do make a lot of noise, so I suppose that gains them inclusion. \n","99":"A: == Greece ==\n\n\nB: I'd like to see references for that 29,000 claim for Greece. According to the 2001 census, there are 23,066 Romanian immigrants in Greece, and 5,898 from the Republic of Moldova (of course, it's a question of doubt whether they are all ethnically Romanian and espouse a Romanian national identity - there may be ethnic Hungarians or Russians - not to mention ethnic Moldovans p). \n\nA: B\u01ce pul\u01ce verde dac\u01ce nu \u015ftii nu te b\u01cega!!! \n\nB: ''ETHNIC MOLDOVANS'' are the same thing as '''ETHNIC ROMANIANS''', stupid fuckhead! \n","100":"A: == Happy Birthday! ==\n\n\nB: Hungry?

He has not only made a personal attack of deletion on a very important article outlining the history of the show \"Joppa,\" which met various notable requirements, but he is now going so far as to continually eliminate all semblences of the reference to \"Joppa\" on the general \"Joppa\" article on wikipedia. This show is an international phenomenon. It is THE refenced site when Joppa is typed into Google, and has had various features on both MySpace and iTunes. Wikipedia has a page for the word \"Joppa,\" and it is my belief that, if you can't give it an entire article, it should at least get a mention on that page. This user, IrishGuy, continues to harass us on that point. I don't know where else to turn. He seems to feel like he owns this website. Maybe he does...I don't know. It should also be mentioned that, out of spite, this user also went on a crusade to delete any pages associated with the comedy group. There's something not right here. He's giving this entire site a very bad name in my eyes. \n\nA: WhatIsJoppa.com was deleted due to failing wiki_link in an AfD. The above user and two others have recreated the article twice and have spammed the address of the website into numerous other articles. No associated articles have been deleted or have even been up for AfD. That assertion is just blatantly untrue. \n\nB: Watch what you accuse people of, boss. I have had no hand, nor have I heard, that the article has been recreated. I spoke to the admin responsible for making the call on the issue, and he has already informed me of the fact that when the newspaper articles come through, the page is going back up. So, NO, I would not have risked other people's work by reposting it. That is a lie. What other people have done with itthere are a LOT of fans, and I can't control them allis their problem. Additionally, the verdict was passed down that the article on Whatisjoppa was to come down until the newspaper stuff was issued. HOWEVER, the link to whatisjoppa.com was posted on the \"Joppa\" article page a very long time ago, with NO PROBLEMS, and NOT by myself. You have made this a personal vendetta of yours to delete that as well. An explanation of the \"group\" Joppa is only right belonging on the \"Joppa\" page because it is, according to google, what most people associate with Joppa in this day in age. So, please stop terrorizing us. You have obviously made this a personal issue, because you're hell bent on having that link removed, which has been up there for over a year, with no other member of this site having any problem with it. PLEASE LEAVE US ALONE. AND, leave our associates alone, as well. If you'd like to check the history of the \"songstowearpantsto\" article, you will see that IrishGuy went after them because of their association with us. Unfortunately, he was in over his head, and the article remains. You are out of control right now. This is NOT in the spirit of wikipedia! \n\nA: Actually, you ''do'' control them. You sent them here . As I have clarified before, disambiguation pages aren't for external links. Seeing as how you have been harassing me since the AfD , which of course got you blocked, and that you have been spamming your link into other articles (examples:      etc.) only articles created by me, by the by...I think it is patently clear that the only harassment here is coming from you towards me. Additionally, the guidelines for wiki_link state that links to be avoided include: ''A website that you own or maintain''. \n\nB: I don't know what that link above to the discussion board has anything to do with my control over people? It's simply informative. You should read it again, my friend. Secondly, it has already been established that what I do on this site has nothing to do with the people that created the Joppa article, or implemented a mention of Whatisjoppa on the Joppa page. I could be the biggest ASSHOLE on this page. But, I haven't created anything on wikipedia. I'm simply defending people that have. Furtherfore, as I already explained, and you ignored, I did NOT originally post the link on the article. It was posted by an outside source, and erased by YOU. It had been up there since December and no one had touched it, until you came along and started harassing our site. Feel free to check the history on that one, as well as on the \"songstowearpantsto\" page for IrishGuy's additional harassment. \n","102":"A: ===1 Production History===\n\n\nB: The Bradley, named after WWII General Omar Bradley, is a replacement for the M113 family of APCs and consists of two types of vehicles, the M2 Infantry Fighting Vehicle and the M3 Cavalry Fighting Vehicle. '''''The M3 CFV was originally going to be named after General Jacob L. Devers, but it was decided the Bradley name would apply to both, since both vehicles are based on the same chassis (they differ in only some details)'''''. The M2 carries a crew of three and a six-man infantry squad. The M3 on the other hand carries only a two-man scout team and additional radios, TOW and Dragon or Javelin missiles. Where did you find the source for this statement? According to '''''Camp Colt:...''''', the Bradley was always to be a composite vehicle, designed specifically to satisfy the needs of both Infantry and Cavalry. That being true, and given the Army's naming conventions of using a common name for all versions of a program that share all or most components, it is highly unlikely that they would assign a seperate name for what is - for want of a better description - essentially an identical vehicle which is internally re-arranged to fulfill similar but distinct missions. \n\nA: The M3 Bradley CFV is a designation confirmed by Army sources.  While it seems that they do not warrant different designations, it is likely that the history behind who it was to be named after had some part in the desire for a seperate designation.  By your logic there should have been no way that the XM107 rifle could have come into being, since it should have been, from all accounts a variant of the M82 rifle, already type classified.  The Army is well known for its refusal to change things once on paper, and it was likely that after the M3 Devers CFV designation was dropped, it was simply easier to change the name rather than the entire designation. \n\nB: Regardless, what is the source of the Devers statement?  I did a google, and the hits returned this article and derivatives thereof.  If there is no citation, then it needs to go. \n","103":"A: == suggested move ==\n\n\nB: i suggest we move this to \"bradley fihgting vehcials\" as the artical refers to the M2 and M3.( ) \n\nA: '''Comment\/Support''': I suggest we move this page to \"M2\/M3 Bradley\" or \"M2\/M3 Bradley Fighting Vehicle\" rather than that suggested.  Technically the M2 is the Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) and the M3 is the Bradley Cavalry Fighting Vehicle (CFV).  To clarify the point, I support the name change, but to the name I suggested instead of simply \"Bradley Fighting Vehicles.\"  You wouldn't suggest moving say \"M16 rifle\" to \"M16 rifles\" to cover its subvariants. \n\nB: '''support''' This article also covers the M6, M7 and other variants.

Just some wondering. \n\nA: We all know Wikipedia can uncover our IP addresses, but only a very limited number of individuals, called checkusers, can do so.  So, you or I cannot tell who edits from what IP address.  And a lot of IP addresses link to a company, and it would be easy to track someone down.  What he is saying is that he didn't want to confirm the IP address, which was posted when he accidentally edited with is IP address, because it would have indicated who he was.

It seems your other commentators figured it out. \"''Let me repeat myself very clearly, because you apparently are not understanding me''\" Oh I understand you perfectly well: you felt free to steal material without giving credit.  You posted it as your own work.  The word you are looking for is \"plagiarism.\"  One could accept that as accident save you kept removing the citation after being alerted to it and behaved like a petulant babe caught with his hand in the cookie-jar in these comments. \"'''''...I didn't write it.  Are we clear?'''''\" Oh I understand you '''now''' admit you committed plagiarism.  You compounded that by removing all reference to the author when you pasted it, then when alerted to it you threw a tantrum as you are now.  All you had to do was leave the citation.  Instead you removed the citation not once, but twice to leave the impression that ''you'' wrote the material. It is really not terribly complicated. '''Doctor X''' \n\nA: OK, stay off my page.

However, with respect to chiropracticundecided.  From what I know, Chiropractors receive significant education and training.  They can read an x-ray of the spine much better than I can.  They understand skeletal-muscular relationships fairly well.  I consider them a higher level of masseuse, one that understands kinesiology and other physiological relationships.  They can't prescribe drugs (at least here in California), so they aren't quite physicians, but they provide a service.  A lot of physicians dislike them.  A lot of physicians use their services.  I think a neutrally positive article makes a lot of sense. \n\nB: Some peer-reviewed studies have suggested that for some forms of back pain, they are competitive with or superior to surgery or other treatments.

Yes you can be a proponent by logic, and in fact, I demand that (perfect reason to despise politicians even more).  But \"Evolutionist\" is described, even that article, as a religion.  And the wiki_link, which is the best dictionary every on the English Language, states that:  Nope, it's not.  It is not a term that I would ascribe to any person who  upholds the doctrine of evolution; an adherent of evolutionism.  Adherent?  Doctrine?  Those are religious terms. \n\nB:  So a physicist  upholds the doctrine of physics. Captialist, Biologist? etc? You really think that calling someone who is a proponent of evolution an evolutionist is a slur? Then why isn't the term creationist a slur? \n\nA: I don't write the fucking freaking definitions, the body of English literature and linguistics does.  The \"ist\" does not imply faith, just the whole word.  A creationist is not a slur, because it is defined as a religious description for how everything got here.  You can call me anything you damn well please.  You can call me an Evolutionist all day long if that's what floats your mythical ark.  I'm just telling you that I don't take Evolution on faith, it's a science, so it's one of those Creationist ploys to try to make Evolution out to be a faith-based religion too, when it isn't even close.

I think they are only going to have Fei Long and that's is of the original SSFII New commers but, you never know. \n\nA: I have another question.  What about the announced PC version?  Will it just have the arcade cast of characters or will it share the console version's cast?  Anyone know?  As for speculation of whether Akuma, Dee Jay, Cammy, or T. Hawk hitting the console version there is no doubt.  If Fei Long is then no doubt the rest of them are as well.  It wouldn't make sense to a lot of SF fans if they just suddenly disappeared after SSF2T.  The people behind SFIV have been interested in getting in as many characters as they can and besides, Akuma is a fan fav that has been strongly rumored\/wanted and Capcom is interested in putting in more female characters which no doubt, is probably going to include Cammy.  Rest assured the SSF2T cast is probably all going to be in here.  But we'll have to wait for official sources just to be sure.

There is no proof that Cammy, T.Hawk and Dee Jay aren't in this game.  Whoever posted \"Two exclusive characters for the console versions have been revealed. The first is Fei Long who made his debut in Super Street Fighter II and Dan a regular from the Alpha series.\"  Is making a wild accusation.  They saw sketches in Famistu.

As far as another GAN goes, I guess I'd be looking at what requires the least work, since I'm having to severely ration my time on the music-related stuff at the moment. If you have suggestions among the Bowie albums, let me know. They'd have to be pretty well up-to-scratch content-wise and only require the sort of fix-ups I did on ''Station'' for me to nominate though. A related one I find the most likely candidate now is in fact ''wiki_link'' - comprehensive and well-cited, if not to the same extent as ''Station'' since, as you've deduced, I kind of see that one as FA material for depth and breadth, even though it will need some further style and citation improvements to pass FAC. Cheers, \n\nA: (Re)assessed the three Bowie albums.  I just skimmed the articles, but it was obvious that they are sufficiently comprehensive for B-class status.  They contain lots of formatting annoyances, though, which didn't appear to be your doing.  I'll see if I can take care of those, at least. \u2014 \n\nB: Tks mate.

I try to keep my \"personal reasons\" in line with the wiki_link for good articles instead of a comparison with other good articles (that may have been passed erroneously).

If someone's correspondence is forwarded to the Committee, there is no legitimate reason they shouldn't be notified to allow them to deal with the matter in a timely and fair fashion. Is there any honest reason this would not be a good idea? \n\nA: If you're dealing with mail from someone who's harassing you, the last thing you'd want is to have them contacted. So it's better to say people ought to be informed as a matter of courtesy when it's reasonable to do so, or words to that effect. \n\nB: In a case like that, though, why wouldn't it be a good thing for Arbcom to notify them them that they're effectively on notice? I don't know if this is an ignorant question. If it was pure unmitigated harassment (sexual, threats, etc.) the person should be banned immediately anyway. But, in case it is something that is possibly borderline or an eye of the beholder sort of situation, that Arbcom would have to sort it out. I don't see why an Arbiter or Clerk shouldn't notify them. Why would it be a good idea for them to not know the Committee was investigating them? \n\nA: I think the concern is that they would \"shape up\" until the metaphorical \"heat\" is off - or start over with a new sockpuppet - thus avoiding getting caught. \u2014 \n","137":"A: Yes. Unlike the Durova case, where multiple verified the message was authentic. Just wanted to post it here, as it's right in line with the discussions on this page. \n\nB:  Interesting case.  Should we take the complainant's word for it?  One way forward is if Elonka concsents to posting the content with the private information in the headers (ip etc.) redacted.  Another possibility is the involvement of a trusted third party.  A better alternative all round is for Elonka to withdraw at this point and then take the matter to ArbCom or an RfC where context can be more fuly evaluated; it's hard to combine RfA and a shitstorm.  () \n\nA: And now there's another poisoning of the well going on down at the bottom of the talk page about alleged deleted evidence. Go see. Perhaps their needs to be a note that alleging inflammatory \"private evidence\", which can't be disclosed, is an action that can bring sanction. Otherwise, people can pull trump cards like this repeatedly on avenues with a limited duration like RFA. \n\nB:  You'll never stop that kind of crap, I think.   () \n","138":"A: == Guideline tag ==\n\n\nB: How is the fact that this is a guideline under dispute? MOSLINK has been the one constant throughout, with the exception of merging wiki_link and wiki_link into it. \n\nA: We're at arbitration over much of this, so the better question is, how isn't this under dispute in your mind? We wouldn't be at arbitration (and the arbitrators certainly wouldn't have accepted the case) had there been no dispute... \u2014 \u2022  \u2022 \n\nB: Really? Several arbitrators and at least one clerk have said it concerns behaviour alone. What are you talking about? \n\nA: Behavior surrounding this issue (date links), and the issue is of course unresolved, hence the dispute... \u2014 \u2022  \u2022 \n","139":"A: == Links to years ==\n\n\nB: Please stop re-adding this language about not linking to years. How long must this go on? \n\nA: Well, that is your own view, and if yet another test of the opposite consensus were required, it will be done in the upcoming RfCs. In the meantime, the long-standing wording should be left untampered with. \n\nB: Agreed. Until the current negotiations are concluded, could we please leave wording alone? \n\nA: Nonsense. There are no RFC's to support delinking all years. \n\nB: There are now three editors (Tony, Phone, and myself) who believe the long-standing wording should remain until this debacle is over. Please leave it alone until the current process is finished. Could you please stop using imperatives such as \"''nonsense''\"\u2014they don't make your \"argument\" any ''more'' correct. \n\nA: The language isn't \"long standing\" that's a joke. Reinsert it, I'll add the  tag and this never ending edit war can continue indefinitely. Why won't you people give up, admit that you have no consensus not to link to year articles, and move on? \n\nB: All very disappointing. We were all making such progress, and then you have to come along and (single-handedly) rattle the cage. My point about three users wanting to keep the wording as it was (at least through the current rebuilding phase) remains unaddressed by you. For that reason, I've reverted the wording. \n\nA: Fine. Some day this war is gonna end. \n\nB: Soon I hope\u2014that's what lots of us are working towards. Perhaps you'd like to help? \n\nA: Oh golly gee, I'd be overjoyed. Except there is no light of day between our positions. As such, there is nothing to be worked towards, sirrah. So sad. \n\nB: Compromise and consensus are always possible. One \"side\" of this is offering points in the attempt to achieve a conclusion. One example is wiki_link, and the latest is to find acceptable wording . I can only encourage you to help out, but feel forced to remind you that comments such as \"''there is nothing to be worked towards''\" will do nothing to help in the long run. Based on your inherent negativity, and in regards to your derogatory termination, I find the description of \"obsolete\" to be apt. \n\nA: Well, you obviously don't comprehend the underlying issue.

There are seven main criteria that the article must comply with to pass: Well-written: Pass Factually accurate: Pass Broad: Pass Neutrally written: Pass Stable: Pass Well-referenced: Pass Images: Pass I have concluded that, in my opinion, the article has passed all categories and I therefore award it wiki_link status. Congratulations to the lead editors, and keep up the excellent work! Kindest regards, [] \n\nA: On behalf of all the lead editors of this article, thank you for your review and the GA status!!! \n\nB: The above review has been copied into the GA comments page, linked via the GA related infobox at top. \n","141":"A:  this wikipedia is not your fan page. :: and are you japanese? \n\nB: The goal of this article is not to promote Japanese culture; references of Japan are made when they are directly relevant to the history of Lexus. You may notice in the above talk section that I have personally removed statements which seem nationalistic. Furthermore, it appears based on your contributions records that  is the same as  and has used the URL , all focusing on topics related to Korea. Based on the history  of this user, there appears to be a troubling record of disruptions, racism, and unwanted editing behavior which does not comform to acceptable Wikipedia standards.  Interestingly, these warnings have been removed from the current talk page, in possible violation of wikipedia rules. It is also possible that this user is responsible for the earlier vandalism to the Lexus article, which also was focused on nationalistic grounds. I hope that this record will change, but doing vandalism, followed by multiple changes under several disallowed pseudonyms, is not helpful. Please reconsider your actions, and consider this a friendly notice. \n\nA:  we do not need personal attack, japanese. calm down. japanese. are you stalker? ```first, we do not need your garbage article. if you want lexus page, then you make another lexus fan homepage, ok? japanese? \n","142":"A: == October 2011 ==\n\n\nB: You have been '''wiki_link''' from editing for a short time for your wiki_link caused by wiki_link by violation of the wiki_link. During a dispute, you should first try to wiki_link and seek wiki_link. If that proves unsuccessful you are encouraged to seek wiki_link, and in some cases it may be appropriate to request wiki_link. If you would like to be unblocked, you may wiki_link by adding the text  below this notice, but you should read the wiki_link first.    () \n\nA: *As I've already declined a request I won't review this one, but I don't think you are getting the point. If you could show some understanding of why ''edit warring is wrong'' that would help your case. Trying to wiki_link your way around this is not what we are looking for. Discussion is what you do ''instead'' of edit warring, not what you do ''along'' with it. \n\nB: I did mention that it was a mistake, because I did only three edits in that context, which is technically true, but as you called it 'lawyering', I make it clear that I was infact trying to abide by the rules and ''resolve'' the dispute not noticing that my next three edits, which were rather a specific addition to make it neutral as citation was missing unlike the POV tag which was being reverted before, would be taken as edit war. Also the user kwami was reverting the article more than I did without wanting to discuss or give any reference on the talk page. Just like JamesBWatson said, it went back to july, but no action was taken against him even though I filed him. \n\nA: Let me clarify something, TopGun.  You wanted to either remove \"Hindustani\" or make it refer only to India.  Your initial edit warring was over that.  Then when you could not get that to stick, you added the POV tag to indicate that international scientific opinion is POV.  After reverting the removal of the tag three times, you switched to reinserting your POV.  Your reverts might have been in two different places, but they were for the same thingpushing your unscientific POV about \"Hindustani\".  Just switching the locale of your edit warring doesn't restart the wiki_link clock if the ultimate end is the same. \n\nB: Exactly what kwami was doing! Reverting so many times over a period of time. I reverted it because you had no valid references (those you gave had POV issues - read talk page of the article), and kwami had no references at ''all'' since july. He actually started to breach civility when he got tired. \n\nA: What this block should teach you, TopGun, is that you must follow wiki_link.  If you make an edit to an article and are reverted, you do not begin an edit war, you go to the Talk Page and build a consensus for your change.  If you are unable to build a consensus, whether or not you think you are right, you then drop the issue and leave it alone.  If you engage in an edit war over an issue that you have failed to build a consensus for, you will be subject to further blocks that are progressively longer in duration.  So far, you have failed to convince either kwami or myself of your position and your \"evidence\" is substandard at best.  I strongly suggest you review wiki_link and wiki_link. \n\nB: Your 'evidence' on the other hand is biased & and you've failed to give any links that count the opinion of both sides to make it neutral. Also, donot post about that discussion on my talk page, use the article's talk page. kwami has been following the wiki_link technique over the months to revert the article over and over without giving a single reference. I consider my block to be punitive, which again is against wiki's policy. Since this isn't a block review anymore, this discussion is over. \n","143":"A: == Removing content from talk page ?  ==\n\n\nB: from your past history it shows that you were Blocked for some period. Please remember that if your actiion lead to your blocking again then it would be permanent this time. Also removing content from your talk pages does not serve any purpose and will show that you are trying to hide your past which you cannot hide. see   .your cleaning up of talk page will only degrade your case.  Try ARchiving your page rather than removing content. \n\nA: I don't think that I've done anything that would get me blocked. You should not judge me on any of the previous history, you're not aware of it and neither is it related to this case. Again, why are you reminding me of getting a block? It is obvious that histories and diffs are saved in wikipedia. Whether I remove content from my talk page or archive it is completely upto me. It is trivial that any one can see it from the history, so it will not, in any case, reflect bad on me in context of hiding. \n\nB:  The Administrators always look at the past history before blocking a persons, \"A person is of course judged on his previous edits on wiki\". more over your removing of warnings against you will only weaken your case and show that you are hopelessly trying to evade the eyes of the admins here.  \u2014 Preceding wiki_link comment added by   \u2022 \n\nA: That is for admins. It is no business of other users to prejudice against the user in question due to a previous block. And this is stupidity... there's nothing hidden, all my edits are there in the history. And my talk page is none of your business. Stop advising me on it. \n","144":"A: ===writing credit===\n\n\nB: It's fairly well documented in various interviews that the writing credits in Queen, for nearly all of their career (up until 'The Miracle' album), reflected merely who wrote the lyrics - apparently they were trying to allocate credits for \"Liar\", which was an old song from Freddie's previous band ('Wreckage'?), and contained guitar lines written both by Wreckage's guitarist, and new stuff by Brian May - Freddie reportedly declared \"as far as I'm concerned, whoever wrote the words has written the song\", and May said they stuck to this rule of thumb until 'The Miracle'... ...bearing this in mind, is it not more accurate to state that, although Freddie Mercury formally owns the copyright for authoring the song, that May wrote the music for several of the guitar based bits?  (I'd just go ahead and change the article, but don't want to be reverted by Queen fans crying sacrilage ;-) I'm not sure where you got the above idea from. \n\nA:  Brian has stated in many interviews, in particular on the Audio Commentary on the latest DVD\/CD release of A Night at the Opera that the song was entirely dreamed up by Freddie.. he even wrote the guitar parts for it.. \n\nB: Yup, you're right - this song seems to be an exception. \n\nA: I'm not sure where you got that idea from, nor do I recognize the Freddie Mercury quote that you are alluding to. With regard to songs credited to May and Mercury, those two generally wrote both the lyrics and the melody of their songs. On the other hand, Deacon and Taylor often received  musical help from Mercury in particular. In fact, Taylor actually admits that Mercury re-wrote large sections of certain songs for him, such as \"A Kind of Magic\" and \"Radio Ga Ga\". However, as with any band (or even when seesion musicians are involved with solo artists), one individual may contribute in some way to another person's song without rightly claiming a songwriting credit. \n","145":"A: == Video and the Title ==\n\n\nB: I couldn't find anybody other than the author of this page who claims that this is the \"first music video\" in any sense, so I removed the claim to that effect. I also tweaked the subjective interpretation of the title, and toned down the claim that \"many\" tout it as the \"most popular song in the world,\" which would need some evidence. \n\nA: There has been a lot of rather woolly thinking and propaganda over this \"Bohemian Rhapsody was the first ever music video\" thing over the years: clearly it was not the first accompanying promotional film for a single (since ever Queen recorded earlier promo films for their stuff, never mind dozens of other bands!) - what *WAS* a \"first\" about it was that it started off the practice of a record company providing a promotional video\/film for their acts' single release, with the express purpose of it being used on \"Top of the Pops\" when the act were not available to perform themselves - prior to this, the BBC would play the record and have \"dancers\" like \"Pan's People\" perform to it on screen. This was a big sea change and should be noted in the article \n\nB: I remember reading in a paper last year that the song got some kind of award or something, \"best single of all time\". If I found it online, would that be enough evidence?  \\ wiki_link wiki_link \n\nA:  Perhaps, if you weren't a retard and could construct coherent English sentances...? \n","146":"A: ==Ron Paul presidential campaign, 2008 Criticism==\n\n\nB: A '''wiki_link''' template has been added to the article wiki_link, suggesting that it be deleted according to the wiki_link process.

It would be nice to have specific templates like WW2 template in WW2 related articles or \"big picture\" templates like chinese history template for dynasty articles.

It's preposterous to include the two. The discussion from above mentions religion. But that's not really \"dutch and spanish\", it's more religious proselytization than cultural exchange with any particular country. Most people on Taiwan follow traditional Chinese folk religion and customs and one would be hard pressed to say if there's any \"dutch and spanish\" influence on Taiwanese culture. Even Japanese influence is faint in the current generation. Even my grandparents, who speak fluent japanese because they were colonial subjects, don't celebrate japanese holidays but always celebrate chinese new years and go to taoist temple often.

In addition, at least six other women have come forward to claim that the perpetrator flashed them as well. Hoyt is the co-owner of two NYC restaurants named Quintessence, along with his ex-wife Tolentin Chan, who is a native of Hong Kong.'' Uh, how could you prove that Hoyt's flashing is connected to his supposed Asian fetish? Could someone point out some sources showing that the 6 other women were Asian as well? Ok his ex-wife is Asian, OK. Nguyen is Asian, so OK. But we don't know if say, Hoyt flashed himself to three whites, two blacks, and an Indian, and Nguyen was the odd woman out who happened to be Asian. \n\nA: * I agree.  This article has mainly been under control by an anonymous editor using several IPs who has POV problems and will do anything to throw mud at non-Asians.  I'm going to remove this example from the article and hope that the anon does not revert me; I find it pretty far-fetched too. \n\nB: * The simple fact of the matter is that this is a sexual crime against an Asian female, and so has every right to be placed in a section detailing sexual crimes against Asian women. If you think that it is far-fetched, then please state your justification for that at the end of the paragraph. \n\nA: ** By this reasoning, however, you're saying we'd have to include all (or at least many) sexual crimes against Asian women.  If so, the article would get very long very quickly.  I'd recommend only using high-profile cases, ones with a wiki_link level of attention given to them by the press.  The wiki_link incident did (and does) deserve its own article, since what he did was an unusual crime on a rather large scale, very disgusting, discussed in the news extensively and so on.  Flashing is pretty commonplace and usually wouldn't advance beyond local news.  I'd say just include the crimes in which the offenders already have articles in Wikipedia, or who could have articles in Wikipedia without those articles getting contested by being wiki_link.  Otherwise, we'd have a lot more cases than we need (we only need a few; this article is pretty long on the whole).  Currently, there is no article on wiki_link.  If there were one, it probably would not survive an AfD. *I'll be scanning the news to see if there are any more details in the Hoyt case.  So far I have not seen any specifics regarding the races of the other flashing victims. The thing about Asian fetish is that in fact there are many diverse viewpoints and issues regarding it. However, in writing about this phenomenon, one must keep in mind that this terminology affects different groups unequally.  The mainstream of society, in this case White Anglo America, consciously or unconsciously carries the history of its exploitive behavior towards racial and cultural minorities, and an entirely \"race-neutral\" perspective is anything but equal.  \"Asian fetish\" is an inherently racialized term, for it is the expression of a racial minority.  One cannot limit this expression, as it is essentially a right of the minority group to react against the perceptual imbalances society has foisted upon it.  More work, however, will have to be done to the criticisms section, in order to give voice to more viewpoints, in particular with regards to the apparent double standard in which WM\/AF is labeled Asian fetish and AM\/WF is (usually) not.  3&3 18th Sept 2005 \n\nB:  Can someone please explain to me how the term \"asian fetish\" isn't wiki_link? Please tell me when use of this term isn't disparaging or belittling? \n\nA: **The objection that I raised certainly provoked more discussion than I thought. 70.249.34.67, the reason why I do not think this would be good in an article about Asian fetish is that '''we have absolutely no idea''' if Daniel Hoyt has one. A crime that is against an Asian women is deplorable, but if the criminal did it to women of all races and ethnicities then the criminal has no right to be labeled as having an Asian feitsh. \n","159":"A: == The term itself ==\n\n\nB: Can someone please explain to me how the term \"asian fetish\" isn't wiki_link? Please tell me when use of this term isn't disparaging or belittling? : What if the term by definition is pejorative, which is the case here I believe. I again want someone to tell me how this term can be used without it being disparaging or belitting? \n\nA: * Labeling a term as \"pejorative\" before defining this term is POV. If you wish to label the term as pejorative, please do so after the term has been defined. \n\nB: This article is nothing but a bunch of 's opinionated trash. Numerous times people have tried to label the article with the NPOV template and the user continues to remove it. I have asked the user to explain how the term is not pejorative and have gotten no answers, but yet the user continues to remove my edits. Who made you the foremost thinker on this subject? The greatest thing about wikipedia is that it is a community in which people can learn to compromise and uncover the truth about topics, you only seem to be interested in pushing your subjective POV and blowing this topic way out of proportion. \"Asian fetish\" is a pejorative term to whites, blacks, hispanics and asians. You make it sound like it is impossible for there to be any type of healthy interracial relationship without one culture exploiting the other. And your research methods are deplorable: This article has no objective sources or references that have been peer-reviewed or published anywhere notable. You added a section about how asian women who seemingly only date white men can be called a \"cracker chasing bitch\" with a reference to urbandictionary.com, by all means far from a reputable source. I have never even heard that before. Furthermore, the social consequences section illustrates perfectly the problem of creating a hypothesis and then going out and looking for it in society. Just because there are some rare unfortunate cases of sickos who do not know how to act right in this world, doesn't mean you can generalize that about an entire population. What about all the other functional white\/asian relationships out the (the article itself points out that they are prevalent) that get no media coverage or national attention because they are just boring regular couples with no sick exploitation. This article is a disaster. \n","160":"A: == Parody OK? ==\n\n\nB: A while back someone (I don't remember who) added a sub category of '''Parodies''' under the heading of '''See Also''' and put a link to a South Park episode which apparently did a, well, parody of the Terri Schiavo case. So far as I recall there was no discussion whatsoever about its addition. Does anyone have a problem with that being in the article? \n\nA: I don't, but let's remember that ''real people'' who had key involvement in the case (\"I did better than the Gov\") take precedence over cartoons! I'm not just speaking for myself, but I think I'm a person. (Parody OK?  -  not bad, but let's keep our priorities straight.) \n\nB: I don't have a problem with parody. \n","161":"A: == Revert Gordon Watts on sight ==\n\n\nB: This is my personal request to any wikipedian reading this: Revert any edit by Gordon Watts on sight,in bulk, in totality. I agree with the assessment a ways up: Gordo has become a menace. Thank you for your time. \n\nA: Agreed. He's either crazy or he's playing an elaborate prank\/hoax on us. In either case he's long since exhausted our capacity for humoring him. \n\nB: I \"resemble\" that comment. If you don't believe I am telling the truth in my involvement, call up the Gibbs Law firm or the Terri Schindler foundation and ask them. Or, if you have proof I'm lying, let's hear it; Other than that, no more left-handed compliments. \n\nA: Actually, for the court involvement a simple docket search suffices   and case no. SC03-2420. \n\nB: But that doesn't prove notability. \n\nA: \"left-handed compliments\"? You're an idiot running amuck with a keyboard, tearing through an article that a lot of us have worked long hours to make the best. You've yet to list any specific complaints other than that your vanity links should be in the article, and that your involvment in the case deserves star treatment.  You're a Don Quixote, a meglomaniac with delusions of grandeur, and a self image as a knight in shining armor, unwilling or unable to notice that you're behaviour is more like a drunken bum staggering through the streets leaning on the shoulders of complete strangers telling them your theories of life while blowing beer breath in their faces. Your posts are like someone who suddenly loosens their tongue when they get drunk, but then through their alcohol haze, they fail to have a point, often repeat something they said two minutes ago, and insist that everyone listen to them. You seriously need to find some self-worth. enlist in the army. You'll get your ass kicked and will be the better for it. \n","162":"A: ==Stop==\n\n\nB: wiki_link. Let's read it and end this useless argument. \n\nA: On the contrary, I just emailed all the articles. \n\nB: What articles \n\nA: Just wait and see  heh heh. \n\nB: I never wrote an article that was offensive or anything else that could hurt me in any way. Plus you don't know my name so it will not hurt me in any way if you try to arouse a rumor. \n","163":"A: ==Please give me proof now.==\n\n\nB: If you still furiously deny being Brandon, please give me proof that you are not. Also, you used to vandalize my Wikipedia game. external_link You did not follow the rules even if I stated them very clearly. \n\nA: Alqaeda's '''collaboration''' with rogue nations can lead to Biological Nuclear Terrorism \n\nB: Look at the rules.

Is Beland's Alternate Proposal being ignored? The text on the project page seems to suggest that the plan is that any editor, logged in or not, who considers that any statement is insufficiently sourced will be ''encouraged'' to simply ''erase'' it? That can't be the current plan. Or can it? There are some editors who do behave this way, but they are not among the better sort. I can't believe the ten or so contributors here think that this is socially acceptable behavior, and are ready to press it as ''policy''. Add a query in brackets [?], perhaps. Or put the unsourced statement in wiki_link. Or do what every sensible Wikipedian does: remove it to Discussion, to be edited up to standard. \n\nA: I think you've misread the proposal, as it already states that information that is disputed but, if sourced, would be suitable for the article, should be put on the article's talk page, \n\nB: That's reassuring. I thought it said ''If there is a fact or an opinion in a Wikipedia article, and it has no source, then anyone may remove the material from the article.'' Imagine the mayhem such a policy would produce! \n","165":"A: ==Unsourced statement moved here==\n\n\nB: For disputes concerning sourced information and text, especially the credibility of sources, users should consult the article wiki_link. I see no source for this. \n\nA: I've reverted your change, because you failed to provide a reference indicating that it was unsourced. ~ \n\nB: You shouldn't move '''him''' back then; you should move '''her''' to wiki_link. Or would '''they''' be wiki_link? \n\nA: I dispute the use of \"it\" in the above entry.  Please provide a peer-reviewed source for this usage or retract. ~ \n\nB: I have changed my wording to use weasel terms. I hope you're happy. \n\nA: Seeing that wiki_link itself is devoid of sources, I now have no recourse but to bring this dispute to arbcom and demand that you be permanently banned from using pronouns. ~ \n\nB: Well, fuck you and the ground you walk on! Hah! \n","166":"A: ==Believe it or not I am a regular==\n\n\nB: and your text is klunky, sorry. \n\nA: We are not writing for well informed Americans.

American or S American continents, or some subset of those concepts. \n\nA: See my latest.

I'd do it myself but don't want to misunderstand any point you might be trying to make about children's rights being alive... Thanks. \u2022 wiki_link'''' \n\nA: No, the article deals with living people so the tag should stay. Thanks, \n\nB: What sort of reasoning is that? While children may be living people, wiki_link is in no sense a wiki_link. In order to be a BLP, an article must both have living people as its subject AND be a biography (that is, it must contain information about ''specific living individuals''). Otherwise, wiki_link, all anatomy articles, and a good chunk of wiki_link would be considered BLPs. \n\nA: Absolute rubbish, if you want to opine go do it somewhere else. Thanks, \n","168":"A: ==Fixing refs==\n\n\nB: We ought to change the web references to the wiki_link format. They currently seem to be in quite a mess at the moment. \n\nA: Half of the references are derived from Kiedis' ''Scar Tissue'', where a citeweb format can not be used. However, for the references which actually cite websites, it is appropriate. I'll begin working on that shortly.  | \n\nB: the Kiedis references could be fixed, too. All that's really needed is the author's last name and page numbers. See wiki_link, wiki_link, and wiki_link for examples. \n","169":"A: == PROTECTION ==\n\n\nB: '''Can someone please protect this article, a user is trolling and reverting every change that is made. I am tired of having my edits deleted. It would save a lot of time and stress just to protect the article.''' \n\nA: As I've mentioned in the edit history, the reason I keep removing the logo is that it is used merely as decoration, which is hard to justify under wiki_link, and because it's so large it distorts the infobox. \n\nB: The title does not distort the info box. It flows perfectly. And if you havn't noticed, band logo's are an accepted thing to do: wiki_link wiki_link wiki_link wiki_link wiki_link etc. \n\nA: No. They are a violation of fair use as such logos are rarely criticised in the article.

The order is a little meesed up as it currently is the article begins with his bio, how he came up in the rap game, is albums, etc. then it goes to his beefs with people, then it goes right back to talking about his music, where he currently lives, switching labels, etc. \n\nA: While I don't think it is completly neccassary, id does make sence to move it together. Plus by naming it \"Life after G-Unit\" it can be implied that this article is in coronological order, which isn't entirely true. \n\nB: Why move the section up? It doesn't seem necceassary. Most the stuff happened after his beef with those artists. :::Well it's also the content. It talks about his beef which G-Unit, which belongs in it's respective controversy section (a lot of which is just repeat info). Then it says stuff like his plans on getting married, moving to Glendale, and leaving Aftermath, which all could\/should go in the biography section. \n","171":"A: ==LIFE AFTER GUNIT OPINIONS==\n\n\nB: \"Within the rap community, '''many of The Game's fans''' felt that the diss song entitled \"300 Bars and Runnin'\" was the pivotal rebuttal that destroyed the credibility of 50 Cent and G-Unit.\" This is COMPLETE OPINION, this needs to be changed.  This isn't a fansite \n\nA: There is nothing wrong with giving opinion as long as it isn't presented as fact or doesn't contain weasel words. The fact of the matter is most of The Game fans (and many hip hop fans in general) do think he destroyed G-Unit's credibilty with this song. Of course there is no way of proving it, but the sentence is the way it is to show what some people though was the effect of 300 Bars and Runnin'. \n\nB: Thats bullshit, its complete opinion presented as fact.  Who decided that he \"destroyed credibility\" who are you to judge what the \"rap community\" believes.  So its okay to say the \"rap commnuity\" believes Game's change of heart footage destroyed his credibility?  Since when do Encyclopedia's state biased garbage that by your own words aren't proven.

Either way it's not a reaction by these countries but a request from the third party which they could listen to or not. \n\nA: Did you have to think hard about that example?

Not to mention the fact that I merely posted it here as a reference point, and not some fact that needs to inserted into the article immediately.

If it happens it will be added. We are not interested in speculations of what might happen or not especially not with Malaysia, the country that is completely confused on this issue. \n\nB: Since the report is quoting the Malaysian Foreign Minister wiki_link it is indeed interesting information. Thank you for that. But is it really true? - we will see. I may remind everybody that we have so far included Serb media reports on India's position which are of the same character as the New Kosova report article. From now on, we should find here a common line how to deal with the Serb or Kosovo articles on third country's positions. In that respect the article is not in good shape, the India entry is the best example for this. My suggestion would be to remove most of these references (many of them are outdated too). \n\nA: we leave them in the do not recongize catagory until they say they recognize. for countries like malay, that would be thwe best thing.... same for macedonia, we wait until they say they recognize, or make a date they WILL recognize, then we start moving things. \n\nB: And more thing - I don't see any quote in that report as DaQuirin suggests. If it had a quote under quotation marks it could be useful. This way it could be anything really, for an example it could be journalist summarization of Kosovo minister words which is pretty far away from the quote as such. \n\nA: yes... \n\nB: ''Malaysian Foreign Minister Yatim congratulated Minister Hyseni on the achievements of Kosovo and encouraged him for Kosovo to continue the path of democracy and social wellbeing. He also pledged hi(s) Kosovar homologue that Malaysia will recognize Kosovo very soon and open the path for the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.'' As for the indirect quote (that's all what a foreign minister can do after 'confidential' talks): Kosovo's foreign minister gives a summary of his talks with his Malaysian colleague in a way that cannot be misunderstood. This is a valuable source of course - if we are to include Serb press articles on third party's positions... I still hope that we can agree on this. It could be given in neutral form as: Kosovo's foreign minister quoted his Malaysian homologue after talks etc. \n\nA: POV \n\nB: All that aside... I think there is information in that New Kosova Report article that could be added to Egypt's section.  Something along the lines of: \"On 29 September, Foreign Minister Ahmed About Gheit said that his government is following closely all developments in Kosovo and the region, and that his country will act at the right time regarding the issue of recognition of Kosovo\".

I do understand that you do not like to have nothing to do with this messy conflict but couldn't you at least help in any way?

We typically do not let edit warriors have the privilege.  After a while of editing without engaging in further edit wars I recommend you re-request it. \n\nB: Maybe you should take a look at my track record before this latest incident. I've only even been blocked once and that was way back when I was a newbie here and even then the block was unwarranted. It was the result of an already on-going editwar over an article between multiple editors. An admin stepped in and blindly mass-blocked everyone who had made edits while the conflict was going on and my edit wasn't even involved. Ultimately that admin lost his admin-privileges as a result of their action and my ban was removed because it was unwarranted although it's still on my record. I've been a editor here for years, and yeah I had my angry bouts with people but none have ever resulted in a block before. So why don't you cut me some slack? \n\nA: To be clear, you didn't lose rollback because you were blocked. I removed your rollback because you were in the middle of a wiki_linky edit war.  I did this about 4 hours before I blocked you. Neither action was influenced by your previous block which is IMHO ancient history.  However, your activity on wiki_link is not encouraging as a budding edit war and I think I'll decline the appeal to restore rollback. \n\nB: Wow, so reverting some anon's seemingly random and pointless edit that really didn't improve or add anything to the article is a \"budding edit war\" now. Right. You know if Wikipedia was a paying job I could understand the need for this level of ass kissing that is expected around here, but this place is a volunteer project with an open door policy of letting any douche off the net step right on in and make changes.

The term push-up is much more common. '''Oppose'''. \"Press up\" vs \"push up\" is a regional variant name for the same exercise. When different national varieties of English use different terms, Wikipedia convention is to just go with the version used by the first author.

For that same reasons   gives. Additionally, a redirect exists, and that will easily suffice. \n\nB: '''Oppose''' From the wiki_link- ''If an article has evolved using predominantly one variety, the whole article should conform to that variety, unless there are reasons for changing it on the basis of strong national ties to the topic.''.

'''\u00a0''' at \n\nA: Looking at the FA topic discussion, it was asked to write it out for a reason I forget. \n\nB: There should be consistency through out all articles, and WWE is a well known acronym which does not need to be spelled out, and it is one of the only few things out there using that acronym. I say change is needed.'''''co''''' \n\nA: For what reason? I still fail to see how \"W.W.E.\" is widely known. I also see no policy which says we should. \n\nB: I see no reason how \"T.N.A\" is widely known either. The thing is, no other company or item uses the WWE acronym, so per wiki_link, it does not cause a confusion as to what the acronym stands for. I can't say the same for TNA, however, since wiki_link stands for various things, unlike wiki_link.'''''co''''' \n\nA: Wasn't the question about consistency? So should they all be spelt out or all abbreviated? \n\nB: Not every time. The WWE Championship is never called \"World Wrestling Entertainment Championship\", while it's not uncommon to say \"World Wrestling Entertainment employees\". ''' ''' \n\nA: But WWE Championship is a proper noun so it doesn't really compare as List of WWE\/World.... employees is just a header. Belts, events and the like don't come into this consistency. \n\nB: I could agree with what Tony said, I just wanted to make sure.'''''co''''' \n\nA: So it is WWE for titles and programs, World Wrestling Entertainment for everything else. \n\nB: Yeah, since WWE titles their programs and titles mainly under the acronym.'''''co''''' \n\nA: Well I guess it is settled. In this case it should not be moved. \n\nB: That was never the purpose of the discussion.'''''co''''' \n\nA: Is this resolved? My point about proper nouns merely meant that the WWE Championship cannot be World Wrestling Entertainment Championship, but it doesn't necessarily dictate that it can't be List of WWE employees. \n","189":"A: == WWE Pay-per-view chronology ==\n\n\nB: I think that '''Pay-per-view chronology''' in wiki_link should be linked to a list all WWE pay-per-views listed chronologically (something like  but with more columns). We have wiki_link, but that lists only the event \"brands\", not the individual events and how they are sequenced. I think it is useful to know what followed what without having to click through every single article's infobox. I'm not sure if my proposed new list could be added to the existing PPV list or would need to be a new page. I would welcome any thoughts on this. Thanks. \n\nA: The problem with something like that is the length and it being wiki_link. The current wiki_link should be enough as it explains and gives a timeline of events as to when they were active and were deactivated.'''''co''''' \n\nB: It is not cruft. There are list of episode articles, list of awards, list of films, etc articles out there. A simple list of all PPV events hosted by WWE, then one by TNA, then one hosted by ECW, WCW, etc could each be made and sourced. \n\nA: Pay-per-views are not television episodes, literally.'''''co''''' \n\nB: Correct, but what exactly is the difference in listing them? We have their main articles in which all we do is list the events, see wiki_link, an article you promoted to FL I believe Truco. From listing all events compared to that, they are not very different. If this list idea is list cruft, then so would that. \n\nA: For one, the main articles such as wiki_link (which I expanded) will do the same job that a chronology would, which would just be wiki_link.'''''co''''' \n\nB: Exactly how? \n\nA: A chronology will just list the order of events right in the WWWF\/WWF\/WWE history, correct? Well each individual article and the main List of PPV lists each event by date by which they occurred and by which they were active. The main template also does the same thing, a chronology would just be something similar. There is no need for 20 different articles about the chronology.'''''co''''' \n\nB: First it must just be me but that made no sense. I don't know why, it should. I guess I'm just not all here today. There are multiple reasons I feel this would be useful. One is a main article for a GA or FA topic of events. Another would be a comprehensive list of all the events which would be a better link than List of WWE PPV events which is incorrectly named to begin with; it would be alot like a list of episodes article. I don't see how it would be list cruft in anyway. What we are doing with events is no different than any other project does with TV episodes. So if they can get them to FL, FA, GA, etc and still be notable, then this would be the same case. \n\nA: While part of me thinks it might be excessive I can see some advantages. It's quite difficult to work out from List of WWE Pay-per-views the full chronology considering some PPVs only happened once (One Night Only, Tuesday In Texas) while some have been swapped around (The Bash, Vengeance) some have been totally moved around (Vengeance). However, this isn't a WWEocracy and I think it'd be more valuable for other promotions - ECW for example fiddled around with their dates a little bit and had some running from 97-98, some 98-00, some the whole way through, some one off, some in one month &c.; Also if you add in their supercards then you'd have good cause for an article. ROH could do with one too as their PPVs aren't often repeated titles &c.; \n\nB: Dont be a smartass Will, all you want is your way recently and its complete bullshit, were here as a project. Now, on to the issue. I agree with Tony, while it has advantages it has its disadvantages, not every promotion is like WWE.'''''co''''' \n","190":"A: == [WIKI_LINK: List of ECW Tag Team Champions] ==\n\n\nB: Does it have a chance for FL? \n\nA: Yes, I think it should be nominated. You may run into opposition because of the sources, though (although they are about as good as we can get). \n\nB: Very true. I'll see if I can find more refs. and stuff. How 'bout wiki_link? \n\nA: List of ECW Tag Team Champions: You should add a couple of sentences onto the lead (yes, I realize most of the WWE title histories have short leads, but they passed a half a year ago when lead length wasn't as big of an issue), you'll probably have to make the table sortable (that's been the recent trend) and you may run into trouble with your sources, but I'd say its worth a shot. List of NWA World Heavyweight Champions: I've always thought this would be a tough one to get to FL, and for the time being I'd say no because you should have at least one good primary source and there aren't any (The NWA website history doesn't work anymore). As well, I think that that the table looks too cluttered and sloppy with the big dark coloured headers where half of the text in those headers isn't visible on my browser, so that should be fixed. And, you don't need to use the same citation over and over again, switch it to a general ref like wiki_link. Hope that helps. \n\nB: Thanks, I'll keep that in mind. I'll work on that tomorrow. But, I just wanted to know if both lists have a chance for FL. Thanks for the feedback, though. \n","191":"A: == Proposed page rename ==\n\n\nB: wiki_link should be renamed Money Incorporated. Money Incorporated was their full name and what they were usually called back in 1992-1993. Inc. is an abbreviation. It's like titling the New Age Outlaws page NAO. \n\nA: I checked through some of the references listed on the page, and Online World of Wrestling, SLAM! Wrestling, and WWE all refer to it as Money, Inc. What's your source that they were ever called Money Incorporated? \n\nB: We refer to things by their common name per wiki_link. \n\nA: And the ignorance of those who never watched something reigns over those who actually know the topic once again.

Calm the fuck down. \n","192":"A: ==Trying to cunter North American bias==\n\n\nB: Of course English users contributing here are largely from USA and Canada, but we should try to make article more objective and also provide news about other major nations. Also, if NHL is clearly the most powerful league in the world, hockey played in North America '''is not''' hockey in general, so every info should be provided with always mentioning its local nature. In fact, from what I seem in recent times Canada and USA failed to win any important international competition, and strongest players are almost all from Europe, aren't they? Bye and good work. \n\nA: I disagree - \"the strongest players\" are most certainly ''not'' from Europe - in fact it's not even close. Currently, the best player in the world is Canadian as is the the top goaltender.  At the time of writing 9 of the top 11 scoring leaders in the NHL are from Canada. No other country has more than 2 in the top 15. I think you'll have a hard time proving your statement to be anything but your own POV. Alo, I don't see how the article can be NA bias, when the majority of it discusses rules of the game, equipment, ice hockey in popular culture and history of the sport - which is all general information. Other users are more than welcome to add information from various countries, however I don't think removing  info and re-arranging the article to better suit European hockey is the way to go. \n\nB: Sorry for getting you raging about that. I am not much into the today's matters: in fact I wrote: \"I seem\". I'll try to expose my point. An unbiased-article, simply, whould not contain a \"History [of the sport]\" section deling only with its history in North America, at least when it is fairly played outside. Hope you appreciated the sectioning I've introduced lately, with a stub about matters abroad. Didn't want to get engaged in any debate about who's stronger or lesser, oh my. But it is true is that Canada and USA have won far less gold medals than other countries in the sport's international tournaments. Good work. \n\nA: Who's raging? Just pointing out some obvious stats that refute your blanket statement. It's also true that washed up Canadian and American players like Alexandre Daigle and Jeff Jillson are able to extend their careers on European club teams because the quality of competition is significantly much lower than it is in North America that they are able to still earn a living playing hockey, but that's beside the point. The history section of the article deals with hockey as a whole. The fact that the sport's first organized indoor game took place in 1875 in Montreal does not indicate North American bias - it's simply a fact. Perhaps a small section of the article may have a factual leaning towards North America, but to state the article itself is North American bias is simply not true. \n","193":"A: ==Unsourced statement==\n\n\nB: ''In the United States eight to ten football players die each year.'' Do you have a source backing this statement up?  I'm curious about this.  I follow the sport closely and I am not familiar with this statistic. It could be a fact, if you include 40+ people in poor shape (like myself) suffering a heart failure while playing whatever with the kids or office mates. While not a source, sports insurance is significantly higher for hockey and football players than any other sports, which shows at least that they are more likely to be seriously injured. \n\nA: Haha If you think about it the fact says nothing about FORMER football players. I'm sure a bunch of old football player die every year. My grandpa was a football player he died last year. Change this \"fact\" \n\nB:  First off, you're chiming in on a year-old discussion.  Secondly, yes, you're right; the fact says nothing about former football players.  It also doesn't say anything about tea leaves, paper clips, the Wilmot Proviso or other such irrelevancies. \n\nA: I was merely pointing out that \"FACTS\" are subjective.

Ruches, 1967 (the work is not a musicological research as I explained in wiki_link, but a volume focused on Albanian-Greek issues from ca. 1700 to 1960) p. 20:\"Souli was inhabited by folk speaking both Albanian and Greek who had gathered from many parts of Epirus to this natural stronghold. Some had fled from as far north as the villages of Laberia when the area swung over to Islam. Other had come from other nearby Thesprotian villages, fleeing the harsh rule of the beys and aghas of Filates and Margariti.\" external_link. p.248 \"Most researches, whether Greeks or not, accept that the establishment of Shepard groups in the region of Souli begun from middle 16th century.

You were part on this discussion, and you have agreed on this exact wording. Whats up now? Did Xenovatis came, and brought any new source that make you change your mind, or are you trying to disturb the page, recycling same old stories? wiki_link. \n\nB: I believe I'm quite clear. We reached an agreement on the leading sentence. Does this forbit us to create a separate section about origin and early presence? \n\nA: Yes it does, because we have discuss it and because we reached a consensus on this issue. If you have no new argument or sources, please stop it. \n\nB: A section on origins seems appropriate only if we can find solid, third-party sources.  The sources presented so far are not third-party, and in fact have very strong partisan positions. Paparrigopoulos is not only very very out of date, but also very very nationalistic. As for ''Epirus, 4000 years of Greek history and civilization'', even the ''title'' makes it clear what the point of view it takes is.... \n\nA: There are 15 sources on that ''single'' sentence, if we remove those 2 it changes nothing. \n\nB: Sorry, I should have been clearer.  I was referring only to the sources mentioned above by Alexikoua. \n\nA: What's worth noting is of all these 15 sources, only the first two refer to the Souliotes as Chams.  The rest should therefore be diregarded.  Of the two, one is from 1939, and the other is a publication of the Great Britain Naval Intelligence Division from 1944, hardly a reliable source on such a contentious matter.  The claim that Souliotes are Chams is thus on very thin ground. \n\nB: 15 sources does not constitute on \"very thin ground.\" (  ). \n\nA: Did you even read my above post?

Being an Albanian does not make you not to be Cham, because Chams are Albanians, a subbranch of them. \n\nB: Well said, well said, \n\nA: @Balk:  Chams are a subset of Albanians, so it is entirely possible for the Souliotes to be Albanian but not Chams.  Your argument that \"Being an Albanian does not make you not to be Cham, because Chams are Albanians\" is therefore complete nonsense.  According to your logic all Albanians are Chams.  Now, if you removed your red-and-black Illyrian glasses, you would realize the what you are doing it WP:SYNTH.  Only two sources say they are Cham, and the rest say only Albanian, yet you insist that you have 15 sources that say they are Chams.  This is ridiculous.  The two sources that say they are Cham are very outdated and need to go.  Alexikoua has brought two new, non-outdated sources, and the article should be changed to reflect what they say.  I therefore propose that the Finley and Brit. Naval intellignece sources be replaced with the two sources Alexi brought, and the article changed accordingly. \n\nB: Yeah the Souliotes were \"Kosovan\". (  ). \n\nA: At Athenean. Does this mean that Gheg Albanians are Chams? lol. Stop telling things that you know are idiotic. \n","202":"A: == Reason for Invading Iraq Poll ==\n\n\nB: Please explain your point shortly. Please keep dialogue in the Comments section. \n\nA: For those brought here by the RFC placed by Mr. Tiibs please understand this survey was not conducted using the proper procedure under wiki_link. The questions are not even of relevant issue as even the admin Mr. Tibbs asked to comment has stated. For that reason there is no concensus being registered here. Please see comments for further understanding. Thank you \n\nB: People can vote as they please and that is one way to express wiki_link, regardless of your wiki-lawyering. So people, just vote what you will and keep on with the consensus-building. \n\nA: I never said they had to stop. I just showed that you are not building a concensus cause you seem to violate the very guideline in which you are attempting to establish a concensus. quite comical that you would invoke a survey and not follow the rules for it. What exactly are you attempting to build a concensus on since CBDunkerson even said its not an adequate survey? You wont answer that of course cause cause then it would expose how the questions do not follow it. You also seem to be mistaken on what a concensus is on wikipedia, opps there I go wiki lawyering when I point out what a guideline or policy says, why do we have those pesky things anyway. \n","203":"A: ==Regarding failed security council resolution==\n\n\nB: I am having a bit of trouble understanding the change made to the second paragraph stating: \"After the failure to get a United Nations Security Council resolution supporting military action against Iraq\" Can anyone confirm a second resolution was ever voted on after Res 1141. I am seeing by a search that the next resolution voted on was \"Security Council resolution 1443 (2002) [on extension of humanitarian programme for Iraq]\" which had nothing to do with asking for war. You can see a listing of its resolutions relating to Iraq by going external_link and specifying your search criteria. Perhaps I missed something, can the user who added the changes please specify if you have a link to a resolution I may be missing. Thank you \n\nA: As the US and UK already knew from the bugs they had placed in their fellow council members' offices - and as everyone could know from the press - the resolution had no chance to pass and was thus withdrawn. \n\nB: That means it is inaccurate to claim the resolution failed. \n\nA: A resolution withdrawn due to obvious hopelessness to get it passed has failed. But even if you disagree, the text does not say the resolution failed. The text says the US failed to get a resolution, which is definitely correct. \n\nB: Its false, you can't fail to get something you didnt ask for. If you look up the history at the UN website, no resolution was in fact ever asked for or voted on. ::::Withdrawn resolutions carry the #, so provide it and you will convince us that a resolution was asked for. Right now you are going against the concensus here that a resolution was ever asked for and are not citing a source regarding it. ::::You have 24 hours to provide a source, the prelude section says Powell went before the UN, not that a resolution was put forward. Resolutions are documents a member nation submits and gets voted on. Its not simply asking for something. So if such a resolution exists as you claim it will have a resolution # after 1441 and before 1445. Please state it and link to the UN website. Else I am afraid you are mistaken. PS even withdrawn resolutions would carry a #. \n\nA: Just look at our own article if you do not know what everyone could get from the media: wiki_link February 25. Why not just look it up instead of starting an edit war? \n\nB: Please cite your sources, you cannot use wikipedia articles to justify wikipedia articles without further sources wiki_link. Please provide a security council resolution number. Thank you \n\nA: Don't be bitchy, just google for it. Everyone knows they tried to get a resolution. ::::::::Ok, ten seconds, first one was on the previous resolution: \n","204":"A: == [WIKI_LINK: Category:Child Wikipedians] ==\n\n\nB: Is there any particular reason you closed this after only two days? - \n\nA: Is there any reason why you disregarded the process concerns, which is the whole point of a DRV? Discussions of content belong at XfD. \n\nB: *I didn't disregard the process views, I recognised the consensus the discussion established.  I'm not quite sure that process was entirely ignored, the category has been deleted twice before.  It seemed to me there was a consensus established and that consensus was in favour of keeping it deleted. I think I stated in my close that I had regarded the process concerns.  I simply weighed the consensus for keeping the category deleted higher than the concerns regarding processes. \n\nA: *I felt a consensus had been established and the discussion was becoming circular.  Both points had been raised, that of the out of process deletion and of the child protection concerns, and I felt the random sampling of users over the last two days established a clear consensus.  I didn't see any directions about how long a deletion review should stay open, and I think the consensus is there. \n\nB: **There should be no weighing of concerns about content at DRV - it is all about process. If there was a consensus that the fears some had were worthy of deletion then there would not have been an out-of-process speedy, as it would have been done with consensus prior to then (and the ''proposed'' WP:CHILD policy would have gained consensus by now and would not have had to go to arbitration). \n\nA: **From what I saw there wasn't much of a consensus about anything. DRVs normally last 5-7 days, except where there is an overwhelming (almost) unanimous consensus, some other process takes priority, or the person who made the decision that is under review reverses their decision early (not normal without significant consensus). None of these were true here. \n\nB: ***I can't agree that there was anything but a consensus to endorse.  Maybe I haven't kept up with DRV as well as I should, but it used to be they got closed when they got closed.  I called it as I saw it. \n\nA: ***No, content can be weighed in some cases.  The community felt this was one such case.  All people involved in the discussion were well versed in the ins and outs of process and deletion review.  Everyone had a chance to consider the processes.  And a consensus to keep the category deleted emerged.  I don't see any merit in restoring the category and repeating all the arguments again at wiki_link.  It seemed clear that there was an even stronger consensus for seeing the thing deleted through process.  To me it seemed expedient to cut to the chase.  I think there was a consensus there to keep the category deleted.  I used my judgement and declared it.  I apologise if that seems like it was the wrong thing to do, but it seemed like the right thing to do to me.  There was a consensus emergent, and I just felt that energy spent further debating the issue would be better placed elsewhere.  I apologise that you feel I acted out of bounds. All that said, do you mind if I push off to bed now, it's getting late.  I don't mean to appear rude, but I'm on UTC time. \n\nB: ****I'm on UTC as well so I take no offence at that! \n","205":"A: == Note of praise ==\n\n\nB: This kind of stuff dosen't get sent around enough, so the bad seems to build up and overpower the good.

I tried to figure out who was right, but also got fully frusterated by the intracasies of what must have been going on for years. Please don't think less of yourself or let the slings and arrows of whomever is shooting at you hit. You are a good and valuable contributor and problem solver.  - \n\nA: *Look, I really appreciate your words, but right this second, and believe me, this isn't easy to write, it isn't enough.  I've been building all this up for ages, because we have this good faith idea and we have this idea of being civil, and it makes it so hard to vent. I really don't think the community values problem solvers anymore, because every single decision made on Wikipedia is now open to review on so many counts it has become an institutionalised bureaucracy.  Consideration is seriously undervalued on Wikipedia and I don't really see a way of improving it.  I know in my own head I haven't got the make up to go rouge, but I also know I can't be chipped at forever.  I'm fed up to my high teeth of all the back biting. \n\nB: ** The \"community\" is shit. The part of the community that you care about - the people who want to empower other people to write an encyclopedia, values problem solvers. We really do - I promise. Decisions on wikipedia are reviewed by people who believe it is an institutionalised bureaucracy, and then the decisions are actually made the way they should be - by people who get it. I *know* it dosen't feel that way for you *right now* - and it didn't feel that way for me external_link, but, and not to put too agressive of a spin on it - we are\/were wrong. Who is biting your back? Some putrid little troll? Some ultra-inclusionist Wikipedia Review kibitzer? An Encyclopedia Dramatica internet whore? I know it's impossible to ignore them (I've tried and failed), but it's not hard to pretend to ignore them, and it's really really satisfying.

Besides the prod tags, you also removed the sourcing tags. Please become more familiar with our policies on sources before making edits like that. \n\nA: *I removed the proposed deletion tags for the \"Tim Cotterill\" because I do not agree that the articles should be deleted without discussion (as is my right). \n\nB: *You have the right to remove prod tags, but before you do so you should make sure you have a reason for doing so that follows Wikipedia policies. I see now from complaints on your talk page and edit history that you go around interrupting the prodding actions on articles and not giving any valid justification for doing so. \n\nA: \"I do not agree that the articles should be deleted without discussion\" makes sense, and yet you '''did not initiate a discussion'', but just removed the tags.

It always helps to de-personalize disputes like that. \n\nA: I agree, and it is nice to get 55 hours of relief from the \"Guy\". He has been stalking me for a couple of weeks now. I don't even want to give my opinion in a discussion where he is involved, and I am certain that there many non-confrontational editors who avoid his tactics of intimidation, stalking and sarcastic bullying, and therefore do not involve themselves in discussions. Why has he not been banned for life? \n\nB: Well, blocking users indefinitely is a tough decision, if they have made some productive contributions.  We normally try to do everything possible to avoid long term blocks like that.  I have no history with this editor, so I can't tell you what he has done in the past (though his block log is quite long).

One editor is aggressive and obsessively argumentative. I only responded with him to defend myself against baseless personal attacks. DG is blocked for his actions, and I am getting personal e-mails in my support. So that says all that their needs to be said on that subject. But please tell me - what is your personal COI with the article? \n\nA: Man, what a wiki_link that guy  is (I'm sorry - must keep proper tone of politeness - ''wiki_link'' - so I take that back).

Although I was thinking of making a Kido\/Dr. Riddles page, after seeing ep.73 I don't think they are that important.  I think we have enough articles as it stands.  Thoughts? \n\nA: I think a page for Kido should be made. Why not? \n\nB: *The characters that currently have pages are either prominent allies of Zatch\/Kiyo, or major enemies of a story arc (Zofis\/Koko for the Millennium Mamodo arc, Zeno\/Dufort for Faudo arc).  Dr. Riddles is only important during one story arc. \n","211":"A: == Regarding the [WIKI_LINK: Zatch Bell! characters]\/[WIKI_LINK: Millennium Mamodo] articles ==\n\n\nB: * wants to create biography lines for all the characters in these pages, which I'm fairly certain would cause a lot of unnecessary clutter for a lot of fancruft about one-shot characters.  A better idea would probably be to make more pages for the fairly major teams that don't yet have pages, such as Kido\/Dr. Riddles and Ted\/Jeed, and merge the rest of the information into \"Minor Zatch Bell! characters\"... however, given that there are a lot of characters in the series and many of them play important roles, I think it would make more clutter as well.  I suggested a straw poll to see what the consensus would be, but I'm unsure of exactly what the procedure is.  So I guess I'll begin by seeing if there's any desire to change the way the Zatch Bell pages are set up. \n\nA: *Just short summaries. It's no big deal. It's not clutter, other series like wiki_link and wiki_link have alot of info. Why can't the Zatch Bell! pages be like that too. And on top of that, you guys are short-selling by not giving episode summaries, a plot summary page, a complete list of Zatch Bell video games and merchandise, and a timeline. I feel that long-running anime series such as this one should have as much info as possible. It's not with what happening on this site. There's a good majority of info out there and you guys are leaving it out there in the dust. Sure people don't like spoilers, but there's always: So anyway, I suggested a straw poll to see who has a better point.

Faudo gets a bio because 1. he is the major opponent of a story arc, and 2. he's complicated because of his inner workings.  A biography for every single mamodo that appeared in the series is both ugly and unnecessary, and wiki_link to boot.  The compromise solution of creating pages for relatively major mamodo\/bookkeeper teams has the problem of deciding who's important enough for a page, especially with the number of characters relevant to Zatch\/Kiyo who only appeared in two episodes before getting their book burnt.  I am for leaving the articles the way it are. \n\nA: You suck! Because of you and the wiki_link of Zatch Bell! with them not wanting to fight(not even for sport), i'm no loger a fan of Zatch Bell!.

The debate we are trying to have here is not really about who has 'control' over it, but the naming in the Arabic language. Indeed, \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0644\u064a\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a is what it is called and has been called for a long time. As for the actual gulf itself, it isn't controlled or owned by one of the two sides. And for some of the editors here who are vehemently defending the naming \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0644\u064a\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u064a without proper sources, or even proper justification, please stop. There is no reason to start a lame edit war over something like this, the title of the article should follow what it is commonly referred to in English, since this is English wikipedia, but whether you like it or not, the fact is that in Arabic it is called 'The Arabic Gulf'. Thanks. \n\nA: Hi.  If you mean by long time 50 years ago then that is not long time.  In Arabic before 50 years ago it has been \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc and you would not find \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u06cc.  Check here if you do not believe me: .  Thus we are going by the historical name in Arabic texts.  The modern name is Arabic text is mentioned later on in the article. \n\nB: No, we are not going by any historical name. We are going by the name commonly used to refer to the gulf at this time. Thanks. \n\nA: Nope, there is not a single Arabic text that has called it Arabian Gulf before the era of modern nationalism.  Again since you read Arabic read this article .  Note the wiki policy: .  The fact is in all historical Arabic texts it has never been called any other name.  Arabic language does not necessarily mean what Arab countries do or do not.  This is English wikipedia and we follow what historical texts have said about the issue.  The name is Arabic in the first line has to do with the common nae Persian Gulf which is mentioned in historical Arabic texts before the era of rabid nationalism in Arab countries.  Thus it is just another way of writing Persian Gulf per the historical Arabic texts (Ibn Batuba, Ibn hawqal..) I just mentioned. \n\nB: No. The name used in Arabic on this encyclopedia should be the name that is used currently, by most (if not all) Arabs to refer to this gulf. This is not an issue of trying to imprint any Persian or Arabian culture on the gulf itself, not at all. Besides, look at the map, you will see that it the gulf is bordered roughly equally by Arab countries and by Iran. If you go to an Arab country and ask an Arab what this gulf is called, chances are they will say \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0644\u064a\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a. One more thing to point out, the Persian and the Arab cultures are extremely related, some would say intertwined, and I do not understand why this issue would cause a heated debate like this... \n\nA: Actually the wikipedia policy is to not give undue weight to minority POV.  Persian Gulf is the majority POV. I have already explained that in classical Arabic it is also Khalij Farsi.   So the minority POV (in the western world and this is english wikipedia) should not be given the same weight.  The reason that Iranians get upset over this issue is simple.  From the Hadeeths of the Prophet Muhammad till 50 years in  Arabic texts it has been Bahr-e-Fars, Khalij-e-Farsi.. but all of the sudden Nasser\/Saddam.. come and change it to Khalij 'Arabi in Arabic speaking countries.  The reason is simple.  Two groups of people Arab countries do not like are Persians and Jews.  Persians\/Iranians despite being Muslims are disliked in Arab countries and that is why Nasser\/Saddam changed the historical name.  I am wondering if you would like it if someone calledSaudia Arabia as America or Persia?  Personally I find this political manipulation racist as calling Saudia Arabia as Persia.  There is also an ''Arabian sea'' in the Indian ocean and an ''Arabian Gulf'' in western literature used for the Red Sea.  Thus the Arabic countries should fix their mistake with this regard and not try to propogate it.  Note the historical revisionism with this regard. [].  Interestingly enough they say Israel should be called \u0641\u0644\u0633\u0637\u06cc\u0646 and Israel is a new name.  Assuming that to be the case (and I am no expert on that issue), then why the double standard?  Anyways the Arabic in the first line has to do with the common name Persian Gulf in Arabic spelling and we are mentioning it based on historical text[].  Later on in the article it has been explained that Arab countries call it now Arabian Gulf but the wiki policy is to give the common and historical name prominence []\n\nB:  \n\nA: Yes, do not give undue weight to minority POV. I assume that the majority of English sources refer to the gulf as 'Persian Gulf', and that's why the article is titled as such. However, the vast majority of Arabs call it 'Arabian Gulf', and that's why the Arabic name should be shown as such. Writing it as \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0644\u064a\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u064a is giving undue weight to minority POV. Pretty much all the analogies you made are false, especially the Israel\/Palestine example, since the modern state of Israel is a country established on another country's land, and in no way is this similar to this gulf, which isn't really occupied by anyone. Thanks. \n\nB: Yes we have mentioned that Arabs called it Arabian Gulf later on.  But the major name comes first.  Writing it \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0644\u06cc\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc is just how Persian Gulf is pronounced in classical Arabic.  Thus that needs to be mentioned as well.  It does not negate the fact that Arab countries call it Arabian Gulf which is discussed later in the article as a minority POV can not be presented on the first line.  But if there is confusion we can simply remove the Arabic in the first line.   Nevertheless we have mentioned that Arab countries call it Arabian Gulf later in the article.  Unlike the Arabian Gulf which has never been found in any Arabian text..the name Israel is mentioned by Jews .  But I  was trying to understand why Arab countries change names as it suits their political needs and then protest at the same time.  Anyways I think the issue is resolved if we remove the Arabic from the first sentence or leave it as is since it is based on classical arabic texts. \n\nA: The major name in Arabic is \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0644\u064a\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a. I have mentioned before that this is the majority POV. No, do not remove the Arabic name from the first sentence, and in my opinion having it as \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0644\u06cc\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc does not solve this dispute, for the reasons mentioned in all of the messages I have left here. The point I would like to emphasize, is that if both the current common name (\u0627\u0644\u062e\u0644\u064a\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a) and the historical name (\u0627\u0644\u062e\u0644\u06cc\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u064a, as has been claimed), are to be mentioned in the article (and I think they both should be mentioned), then the one which holds majority POV is the current common name, and that should be the one mentioned in the lead paragraph as the Arabic name of this gulf. What do you think of an RfC? Thanks. \n\nB: Actually the article covers all aspects of Persian Gulf including its history.  The major name in Arabic historically has been Persian Gulf until 50 years ago.  The current name of Arabian Gulf is also minority viewpoint in English.  We need to mention that classical Arabic sources have not called it \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0644\u06cc\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u06cc.  They have used terms like \u0628\u062d\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0644\u06cc\u062c \u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc .. So that is why the classical Arabic sources which are in harmony with western sources and Persian sources are mentioned.  We can perhaps under the Arabic of the first line mention classical sources as a reference.  Since the arabian gulf name is a minority point of view, (mainly shared mainly by arab countries and not the rest of the world) we need to either remove it or just mention in paranthesis that classical arabic sources..and for the modern name in Arabic countries see below. \n\nA: Really, I've mentioned what I have to say several times and you still seem to overlook it. I will not explain to you once more. But, I will again propose an RfC. That way we can get a broader opinion. \n\nB: Been discussed a million times before.

If you're still around, and willing to offer some quick advice, I could do with some. I agree that the article is important, so I've been thinking of helping to develop it. However, I doubt I have anything like your knowledge of Spinoza. I'm much better with Hume. ) Towards that end, do you think it would be worth mentioning Hume's approach on the probability of miracles? It clearly differs from Spinoza, as it allows miracles to exist (as you mention in the lead), but I though it might provide a good contrast. The second is whether or not you're aware of where Hunter's \"Spinoza on miracles\" paper sits in the literature. I've been enjoying it, and his distinction between strong and weak miracles seems like it might be worth working into the article, as does the conclusion he draws in relation to Spinoza's stance on the existence of miracles. Mind you, it will take some time before I can catch up on teh literature to do any real work on this - I'm much better on phil. of mind and epistemology. - \n\nA:  Thanks - as you see I've had enough for at least two months.  Yes, Hume's account of miracles - there is an article wiki_link already on the project - would be relevant.  Also, and I didn't have time to work on this, is that Spinoza may (unlike Augustine) have been using the same argument to suggest that there aren't miracles.  Check out the article in the SEP external_link. \n\nB:  [edit] I note the wiki_link article was written by , an Oxford philosopher far more distinguished than I, who I collaborated with a lot in the earlier days of Wikipedia.  He, too, has gone, and for very similar reasons. \n\nA: Thanks. That's effectively what Hunter is arguing against: that Spinoza has been interpreted as arguing against the existence of miracles, but Hunter believes that this is an incorrect interpretation. The strong\/weak distinction (unknown vs unknowable) seems to be an interesting approach to allowing miracles, in a sense, to exist. I'll have to spend some time on the SEP article: it looks excellent, as you would expect. - \n\nB:  Yes.  There is something else I would have added if I could find references.  In arguing with pseudoscience proponents, they very often use a similar argument.  E.g. we should not deride telepathy, fortune-telling and so on, because the seem incredible, for aviation would have seemed incredible 150 years ago.  I've heard the argument many times, but can't find a reliable source for it. :::: [edit] The article wiki_link has an interesting section on the court determination wiki_link, where it was ruled that 'creation science is not science'.  The judge defined science using 5 criteria, two of which invoked the concept of 'natural law'.  But Augustine's argument could be wheeled at this point.  Interesting. \n\nA:  Worth chasing up. My first thought was a reverse of Clarke's law: \"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic\" suggests \"magic is indistinguishable from sufficiently advanced technology\". Although it is logically unsound. ) - \n","243":"A: == Epistemic theory of miracles ==\n\n\nB: Hi, Once an article has been nominated for deletion, you cannot remove the AfD notice from the page. The process will continue with or without the tag, but without it many other editors (those who don't frequent the AfD discussions) would be unaware that the article has been nominated, and thus they won't be aware that the debate is occurring. In this case I don't think that there is anything to worry about, as I'm aware that the subject is notable, and I'll assist with some references to help get it through AfD. I'd be very surprised if consensus was to delete. Nevertheless, it is important that the tag stays present - if only so that others can help with teh article, and because continued deletion will probably result in a block for a wiki_link violation. - \n\nA:  Yes but it's ridiculous it got to this.  I clearly put an 'in use' template on (as I have had problems with this sort of thing before, and was assured this would cure the problem).  This subject is very important in the Western tradition, and I'm surprised (a) there wasn't an article before (b) why it is being nominated for deletion. I have been contributing on these subjects for 5 years on Wikipedia now and this treatment is disgraceful. \n\nB:  PLease stop removing the AFD notice from the top of pages undergoing deletion consideration, such removals are considered vandalism. \n\nA: (ec) I'm inclined to agree that it should have wiated until you had a bit more time, but it is a fairly obscure (albeit notable) topic - I'm only aware of it because I studied Phil. of Religion many years ago. ) The real worry, though, is that once this has started, if you keep removing the tag you'll end up blocked. So at this point we're better off adding some refs making sure that it isn't deleted. - \n\nB: This is your last warning on continually removing the AFD content from the top of the article. A debate on it has already been opened, and you've been warned several times not to remove it. Remove it again and you will be temporarily blocked from editing Wikipedia. As Bilby has said, your best bet now is to expand the article, add references and make sure it is a good article so it isn't deleted, but continually removing the tags isn't helping the case. \n\nA:   This is the '''last warning''' you will receive for your bullshit. \n","244":"A: == Pope election ==\n\n\nB: The wiki_link is chosen from three candidates by chance, shouldn't this be added to the \"randomness and religion\" part ? I don't know if this is done anywhere else so I didn't add it. \n\nA: Although the Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate is a religious institution, this selection procedure has little to do with a  ''belief'' or ''world view'' informed by religion, which is what the section is about. It might be mentioned (very succinctly) in the section on wiki_link. \n\nB: It is completely about belief, this is not done for the election to be fair, it is done to reveal god's will about who should be the pope. \n\nA: Can you give a reliable reference for that? In that case it should be mentioned primarily in the wiki_link article. \n\nB: Can you give a reliable reference for that? In that case it should be mentioned primarily in the wiki_link article. \n","245":"A: == Digits of pi ==\n\n\nB: I don't have Herbert David's book to hand \u2014 could History2007 please clarify in what sense Venn \"showed\" the randomness of pi's digits (decimal digits?) \"by using them to construct a random walk in two dimensions\".  If this just means he used the digits, say, to give a direction and distance to the random walker, and then said \"hey, this looks random\", well, that's \"showing randomness\" in some empirical sense.  Given my realist\/empiricist foundational views, I can agree that it's even a meaningful claim to some extent.  But mathematical readers are likely to be expecting it to mean a ''proof'' of some well-defined claim, and it would surprise me if Venn had done such a thing. As yet, to my knowledge, almost nothing non-trivial has actually been proved about the decimal expansion of pi.  For example, could there be a point after which the decimal expansion consists entirely of 4s and 7s?  No, that's ridiculous; of course there is no such point.  But as far as I know no one has actually proved it. \n\nA: These days  to hand is no longer applicable. I don't have it either. The ref is in Google books, but I looked elsewhere and there were details of the construction online too, but I don't remember where now, although it involved jumping around a lattice of some type. Anyway, the statement is in the ref for sure. Of course Venn was long before Chaitin and company, so his def of random was non-algo. \n\nB: Well, it may well be, but that isn't the whole point.  The point is that it's not clear what it's supposed to ''mean''.  We shouldn't just blindly copy meaningless statements, even if sourceable. ::: You're the one who added the problematic text, so the burden is on you. \n\nA: Maybe you want to do a few searches? ::::The statement does NOT say it is or is not, but that Venn says he proved it. \n\nB:  No, it actually doesn't say he said he proved it.  It says he \"showed\" it.  ''Show'' is sometimes taken to be weaker than ''prove'', so it's possible that it's true in some sense.  But it needs to be clarified.  Please do not add material unless you can make it clear what it's supposed to mean. \n\nA: Sure, sure. I would not want to reduce the quality of this ''pristine'' article now, would I? \n\nB: Your new version of the Venn statement is better than it was before, but also less interesting.  I was hoping you could actually find out, and add to the article, what the thing meant, rather than just weakening the statement.  As it stands it's not clear why the reader should care.  If the reader shouldn't care, then it shouldn't be there. \n\nA: Just forget it. This is a dumb discussion. Delete it, I do not care about this junk set of sentences pretending to be an article here. I was going to start to clean up the mess here, but now I will not bother. You are the guardian of this dump, you clean it up. \n","246":"A: ==That works for me==\n\n\nB: And in case you hadn't noticed, external_link. \n\nA: An external_link is however a clear depiction of his nationality and profession -) \n\nB:  I quite agree, which is why I wonder if we need the qualifiers in the infobox. \n\nA: I fully agree. \n\nB: Two \"nationalities\" and an ethnic group is a bit longwinded for the first sentence though. \n\nA:  Aye, it reads a bit awkwardly. Such are the issues when people are inconsiderate enough to be born in places that currently aren't in their original states.  Let me have a think about that one. \n","247":"A: == Could you have a look please ==\n\n\nB: Hi Black Kite could you have a look external_link please. I have removed this section per wiki_link, this is a thinley veiled attack on Domer. The editor states that they have ''nothing to contribute to this article''. I have warned the editor about using talk pages for personal opinion but they continue to put the content back. They have now accused me of ''bully tactics'' because I removed the content, Thanks. \n\nA: Please bear in mind what my critique was - that 60 + references for a minor topic is absurd and that certain editors are guarding the article. Also bear in mind Big Dunc unilaterally attempted to revert what I typed without consulting me, or even attempting to wiki_link (Worse again, he's accused me of being a troll). Frankly I'm amazed and stupefied by his conduct. \n\nB: Editor has now continued personal attacks by calling myself and Domer gobshites also this editor was blocked by Barneca on for 24 hours due to ''Personal attacks or harassment'' \n\nA: You've been blocked yourself before, and maybe if you didn't act like a little schoolchild gobshite you wouldn't be called one. Honestly, reverting, ignoring, accusations etc. Thats not the traits of someone who isn't a gobshite. I'd say your a fifteen year old billy no mates still in school, the fat spotty kid in the corner with no real prospects. Thats certainly the way you act. Is that personal enough for you, you irritating, infuriating little man? \n","248":"A: ==Conservation? Really?==\n\n\nB: Given the scope of the actions taken by this organization that are described in this article, I think we really need to examine the statement that this focus of this group is \"Marine Conservation\". Most of the actions described in this article seem to be the actions of pirates and\/or terrorists, not actions taken by a conservation group. Given that this group now has a television series, I'm left wondering if the focus of this group isnt really profiteering. Could we consider changing the stated focus of this group from \"Marine Conservation\" to something else as marine conservation does not involve the destruction of property, the violation of Maritime Law, throwing toxic\/caustic compounds into the sea or sinking\/scuttling ships? I'm left wondering how much damage to the marine environment they've caused with each ship that they've scuttled as described in this article. Perhaps at the very least their focus should be changed to \"debated\". \n\nA: Your comment would make a bit of sense if you could point out any similar activities that they are directing against people who cannot reasonably be perceived as doing severe damage to the environment. As it is you are arguing like someone who says that the police can't be described as keeping up order because they use violence. \n\nB: They don't have the mandate that police have. Regardless of their tactics, their goal ''is'' protecting marine wildlife. wiki_link might work in addition to marine conservation. I can't see any reason to remove it altogether though. \n\nA: Pirates steal for money (which does not apply), terrorists terrorise for political goals. The latter could, in some views, be attributed to Sea Shepherd, and this is noted in the article. There is also the \"vigilante\" assessment. Even if\/where they are considered a terrorist group, their goal is not activism itself, it is marine conservation. \n","249":"A: == To Sink or Not to Sink ==\n\n\nB: Appears that there is now doubt the Ady Gill has Sunk!

'''  ''' \n\nA: Hey screw you IP! ) (oops) \n","250":"A: == Is this [WIKI_LINK: WP:NOR|original research]? ==\n\n\nB: Not to start off by citing policy, but I read this and felt that dull thud of wiki_link as I got to the end of the article. I realise, accept and understand that 'credit crunch' is a much-used term over recent months, much as is its counterpart (?) 'wiki_link'. However, I observe that both articles were created circa mid- to late- 2007 ie. in recent months. Taking this article, it has the approach of a theoretical treatise on what a 'credit crunch' is and why one may occur. It does not back this up to an acceptable degree with academic or other economically-authoritative sources. The best it's got is an FT article. This is because there are no text books, no journal papers, no lecture notes or anything of that sort available to help write an encyclopedic article at present. It is an original synthesis of observed effects in the media, a couple of which have citation to newspaper stories. Things like diagnosing that they often follow a period of loose credit is to reverse engineer the current situation to produce a novel, if predictable, notion. There are other examples, too. This kind of original synthesis is exactly what wiki_link forbids, unfortunately. I see two routes out of the conundrum of wanting an article on ''the'' credit crunch whilst trying to write about ' ''all'' ' credit-crunches (of which I speculate there have been no other events so named): Somebody proves me comprehensively wrong and finds authoritative, academic, or otherwise peer-reviewed sources we can cite in this tertiary source. (My preferred route). This is rewritten to discuss the proceedings of the present financial turmoil, and is mercilessly stripped of the imputations, interpolations and extrapolations it currently possesses. This will probably result in merging\/redirection with\/to wiki_link, but might not since its scope is gradually widening to be more than just a subprime-related issue. Along the way, I'd think the same problems lurk in wiki_link and wiki_link, both begun around the same time as this article.  - \n\nA: No, it's not original research.  The references are now comprehensive and virtually every sentence has citations.  I particularly recommend the recent well-researched book by George Cooper, which supports virtually all the statements on this page.  Thanks for your concerns though; it probably prompted others to provide more citations than most other WP articles.  Given the topical nature of this issue, that's no bad thing. \n\nB: I agree with splash. The first line states \"Credit crunch is a term used to describe a sudden reduction in the general availability of loans (or \"credit\"), or a sudden increase in the cost of obtaining loans from the banks.\" This surely is an assertion that needs to be backed up with citations from sources that were written prior to the current situation and should refer to the words \"credit crunch\". \n\nA: Read EGeek's comments above.  As an interesting aside, it is amazing how many latecomers want to make comments and edit pages without reading the talk pages first.  Evolution in reverse or simply going 'round in a circle?  It reminds me of Keynes copying Gesell and then being hailed as a genius.  I vote for \"reverse\". \n","251":"A: ==Editor of the Year Award==\n\n\nB: Announcement: The 2007 WP Editor of the Year Award goes to \"stutterer\" Gentleman Gregalton, who STILL doesn't see the stuff up he caused in the first sentence on this now-slaughtered page.  Good work, mate. \n\nA: Fixed. At least I can figure out the difference between a blog and a reliable source. \n\nB: This is getting childish and embarrassing.  I'm just going to leave it now to see how long it takes for Gregalton to work out what he's done. \n\nA: Yes, your silly attacks and attempts at sarcasm have been childish. \n","252":"A: == Chrono order ==\n\n\nB: this piece would look a lot better if someone would edit it and put it in chronological order. there are dates jumping back and forth all over the place. i'd do myself if i can ever find the time. this edit just means moving things aroundnot deleting anything. i also love it when a person's contributions to popular culture outweigh his life's story (sarcasm, for those not paying attention). \n\nA: I might be misreading where your sarcasm is being placed. Are you saying that it is sad when one's life story is not as big as the impact that their fictionalized role potrayals have become (e.g. larger-than-life)?  If so, I agree. Such as in the case of that people can't expect Shatner to be much else other than Kirk. Or were you thinking it is sad that those contributing to this article are focusing more on the cultural affect of Wayne versus his personal life story? If the latter, I would disagree, Wayne made conscious choices to portray himself as a cultural icon, so it is part of his personal life story especially when his iconic image is inconsistent with his private life. In some ways, Wayne gave up the path of being known for his acting ability because he chose to represent something that was bigger than any one individual movie. \n\nB: John Wayne was not gay, but he was a known cross-dresser. It was introduced to him by John Ford as a means of relaxation. There are many pictures of him in drag. This was not very controversial because in certain Hollywood circles it was in vogue. There was a book written called \"Duke or Duchess\" about his crossdressing, and I believe one of his kids has addressed this. \n","253":"A: == PROTECTION... ==\n\n\nB: As you can see this page has been protected.  An AOL Anon was in violation of wiki_link for reinserting unsourced material after being asked to provide sources regarding the \"Draft Controversy\" section.  Here's my stance. * I've found no sources that point to an actual \"controvery\" the entire section was loaded with POV and commentary, quite a bit of it by the IP user, but the fact is that I did a google search and found no reputable sources about a draft controversy. * wiki_link clearly states that sources should be provided for all material which could prove divisive.  This is obviously divisive, the IP user provided no souces whatsoever, not even ones that meet the lowest wikipedia standards. * I have no problem including it minus the IP users commentary and subjective language and with proper sources for ALL included material.  If Gore Vidal used to laugh about John Wayne then we better have a source.  And so on... Lets discuss this like civilised people and come to a consensus that we can all agree on. \n\nA: Marlon Brando said it's hilarious how the ultimate chickenhawk exponent of America's nuke-'em-all foreign policy died as a result of exposure to his beloved nukes.

All it is is a list of his books, basically. I can figure as much out by logging into my local library. I thought Wikipedia was supposed to be an encyclopedia. I believe that this article should be filled out a little more, e.g. a little more about his backstory, a little bit about his Artemis Rocks tours, a little bit about the Artemis Fowl books (for others' information I do not think that a paragraph about the Artemis Fowl series is too much to add because after all those were the books that created his fame and should be tributed as such). Also, I have been looking everywhere for some kind of contact information and I can't find it on his official websites, on the AF websites, or on here. I think that this article should at least give a way to reach him. \n\nA: Not  like    people  shall  give out personal   information  but yes .  I think  you are right. If  You Want To Contact Him You Have To Interview HIm Or Something Like That. \n\nB: I added a bit of background about the Hitchhiker's book, but this needs more.

Ireland, the article is about the island. People are of states, the wikilink brings the reader to the state, someone would be from Haiti not Hispaniola. \"Are we seriously catering for a readership which is unfamiliar with Ireland\", well yes, the aim is to cater for many different levels of understanding and knowledge, not assume otherwise. I think from reading your comment you didnt know the difference between the name of the country and the name of the article of the country? \n\nB: Please link me to a project-wide consensus that \"people are of states\" and that Ireland should be an exception to our project-wide guidance on overlinking. Please show evidence that there is an encyclopedic benefit in pipe-linking the name of a country on every occasion it appears in an article on a novelist. \n\nA: So people are from landmasses? I think you will find a state or country on every bio. And if you took the time to read the guideline you would know its not everytime. In the lead and infobox (and common sense should indicate the rest). \n\nB: Common sense, ah yes. To me, common sense would point out that wiki_link has a link to wiki_link, for those curious about the political status of this novelist's birthplace. And wiki_link embodies this project-wide \"common sense\". It's an interesting contention that there should be a link to \"a state or country on every bio\"; can you point me to a discussion where this supposed practice is discussed? Because I know that the opposite is true and that whenever this is discussed, thoughtful and experienced editors agree to avoid this type of overlinking. \n\nA: John dont misqoute me, again doing so you  are being a wiki_link, where did I say \"link to a state or country\"? Again failure to read on your part.

This shows you did not read the ACC guide as my notice had requested or YOU misinterpreted what I did and did not say. Chances are the suspension is is for a few days. \n","264":"A: == complaints record ==\n\n\nB: The Telegraph may have said that the number of complaints is \"thought to be a record\" but at 18,000 it is only one third of the number the BBC received for wiki_link, any suggestions for a better way to rephrase this? '''''' \n\nA: *Yeah, remove it. If it's untrue it should go, and there's no point in saying it's the second highest number of complaints recorded; who cares about that? \n\nB: **Is it worth mentioning that the number of complaints (18k and rising) have not been from the shows target audience? When the show with the \"prank calls\" was aired, only about 5 complaints were received. It wasn't until the media started reporting on it that thousands of complaints came in. The number is still rising and I really wonder how many of them have actually heard the calls. I just think something should be mentioned about the amount of complaints by older people who don't listen to the show. It's not aimed at them so what right do they have to complain? They just love to jump on the wiki_link. \n\nA: ***Potentially that is a mine field as they have every right to complain. As with most episodes of this nature, the majority of those complaining will not have heard the calls or be the target audience, but thats the way these things work. Look at the Big Brother Race Row, most of those complaining wouldn;t have watched Big Brother, they would just have been appalled at the behaviour. So in short, it probably isn't worth mentioning (it would probably be POV anyway as I'm not sure how one would substantiate those claims). ***Please read our wiki_link policy.  Analysis of your own does not belong in Wikipedia articles.

On a somewhat unrelated note Uncle G, please don't re-format discussions I'm pretty sure that would count as editing other's contributions. \n\nB: *****It's changing what people wrote that would count, not simply fixing some wikitext list markup. ******\n\nA: Changing something people do for no real reason is annoying. That's the jist of the policy as I read it. \n\nB: ******The complainants might not be the target audience, but there are plenty of transcripts and extracts being printed and broadcast. I suspect the number of complaints could be the largest since Jerry Springer the Opera, if we could get a source for that it would be worth including.

Have three: ******** ******** ******** ******* wiki_link! \n\nB: Back to the point: the article starts off saying it was a record, yet later on points out it wasn't. I suggest the word \"record\" be removed from the opening section. \n\nA: *Seconded. \n","265":"A: ==Where's the article on Georgina Baillie==\n\n\nB: Where on earth is the page for this Georgina baillie? I tried to find it, and to start one when I couldn't but it just keeps coming back to this article which has nothing to do with the lady who no doubt is known by most of the UK by now! :If someone is so famous that they knock the US elections, the credit crunch, and just about every other story off the front pages, I would expect WIkipedia to have at least one perhaps several articles. At the very least 20,000 UK residents have complained to the BBC because of the abuse by J.Ross about this lady. If 20,000 UK people don't count for anything then it speaks volumes for the US-centric outlook of wikipedia! \n\nA: *If i recall correctly it was (rightyl) voted for deletion.

Your common sense is refreshing. I have remained quiet with restraint on the issue until now. Before you raised the question of conversion templates regarding the first mention of barrels in the article, we had 64 conversions of measurements, all in parentheses. Parentheses interrupt the normal flow of sentences. After my edit solution to your (our) problem, we have 63. Still ridiculous if you ask me, but I won't press the issue. I am satisfied that at least to begin the article, we now have conciseness in that first mention of the flow rate, and won't scare away readers right off the bat. Kudos to you for recognizing that \"less is more\", and that users don't mind clicking links to direct them elsewhere for information when necessary. In this case, what you and I stood up for is warranted. I feel honored to be in your company. \n\nA: Thanks. I'm just trying to see it from the perspective of visitors to the page.

There is no consensus to warrent a mass-revert of all my work. I urge you to undo your reverts, or i will have to take this higher. \n\nA: I urge you to think twice before making acusations. There is no concencus to remove the flags, thus until there is the current system must stay in place, and the current system states that the template guidelines should be followed, and those state that flags should be used. It is you that decided to change, regardless of the ongoing discussions. I have not accused you of vandalism at all - in your defence, as soon as you were alerted to the situation, you stopped, which is good. However, I simply reverted so as to stick with the style we are following until concensus is reached. Also, take a look at wiki_link, specifically \"Reading another user's contribution log is not in itself harassment; those logs are public for good reason. In particular, proper use of an editor's history includes (but is not limited to) fixing errors or violations of Wikipedia policy, or correcting related problems on multiple articles (in fact, such practices are recommended both for Recent changes patrol and WikiProject Spam). The important part is the disruption...\". I am not disrupting you at all. \n\nB: wiki_link, wiki_link and wiki_link dont have them. There is no consensus that justifys reverting all my edits that took me half an hour to make. \n\nA: What are you finding so hard to understand? Until concensus is reached, we stick to what we did before concensus was saught, and that's the inclusion of flags. Now, quit being so petty, and realise that flags should be left in until concensus is reached. \n\nB: Talk about petty, going through someones contribs and reverting all their hard work! \n\nA: Yes, but can you not see that you hard work was ''wrong''? In wiki_link, most definitely, but still wrong. You've been absent from Wikipedia for three years, yet you expect to jump in, create a whole load of edits that cut straight across an ongoing discussion, and you expect them to remain? \n\nB: I dont see its wrong, because its not wiki_link states that you dont decorate with flags and there is no consensus anywhere to say otherwise. \n\nA: wiki_link is a guideline, not a policy. It need not necessarily be followed, at the descretion of editors. wiki_link are also guidelines, so are on equal standing. As these have been around for much longer than wiki_link, they take presidence until concensus otherwise is reached. \n\nB: You should also wait for consensus. I urge you not to revert all my edits or i will have no option but to take it higher. let it go, please! ::::::::RE: ''Why can't you wait for a concensus?''  Why cant you? \n\nA: I am, hence I'm reverting edits to those that are standard, and the standard (for the 100th time) until concensus is reached is to include the flags. Also, I find it highly hypocritical that you state \"let it go!\", when you won't. Also, FYI, I have let it go - I'm now only looking at those articles on my Watchlist. The others, unfortunatly, will have to stay as they are. \n\nB: Listen, the standard for other articles (stated above) is not to have the flags! I'm not out to cause a war. Wikipedia is a very hypocritical place and i feel this is a two-way street between both of us. At the end of the day, you think your right and i think im right. I applaude you for not reverting all my edits again. With luck the people higher than sysops will make things abit clearer one day. \n\nA: This is not an article-by-article discussion, though, it's a template-by-template discussion, and the current standard (until concensus is otherwise reached) is that for ''this'' template, flags are used. \n\nB: Then why dont the other articles have flags? \n\nA: Using another article to argue a point is flawed and wrong.  See wiki_link. \n\nB: Without wiki_link, I think what  is referring to is wiki_link, the rebuttal to a common argument that other article which shouldn't exist or have policy\/guideline-defying flaws are an excuse to repeat said errors. - \n\nA: The reference cuts both ways and points out that \"When used correctly though, these comparisons '''are''' important as the encyclopedia should be consistent in the content that it provides or excludes. The problem arises when legitimate comparisons are disregarded without thought because \"other stuff existing is not a reason to keep\/create\/etc.\"\"  The question lies in the validity of the comparison. ::This may have been an oversight however Islander never responded to the final point made by Ckatz in the thread:  [EXTERNA_LINK: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User_talk:Ckatz#Edit_war_regarding_use_of_flags] \n\nB: Ahh, missed that entirely.

As a sysop, you should be defending my rights not siding with someone in the wrong because you like them better! \n\nA: I'm well aware of wiki_link, and as it says, ''repeated'' replacement of material does nothing but antagonise. However, replacing the contents of your talk page once does not count as repeated, and thus your threat was uncalled for. \n\nB: Whatever, i'm still right. \n\nA: Yup, I can clearly see why you started an RfA with an attitude like that.

If you have an issue that you would like admins to deal with, it is better to post a single message to the wiki_link. \n\nA: Sorry for my messages. I did not know what to do.

Please discuss at wiki_link. Cheers, \n\nA:  Agreed.

Magazines do not have ISBN.... What to do...... Forget that. There are few donkeys in the world, who do not even have a magazine to quote. They just type all the rubbish that comes to their mind.

However, since the image was given as part of an award given to me by another user, you also inadvertently removed the text as well. I suspect that you also did that to other people who also received the award. I would like to suggest that instead of removing the entire section, you should replace the image with something like \"fair use image removed\" or something so that the text of the award is still preserved. I didn't like going to my user page and finding that Evilphoenix's words of praise were missing from it.

Could an uninvolved admin please carry out these minor formatting edits? It would be best to mark them as ''not'' being to do with the subject of the ongoing mediation, as otherwise the edits might upset some people.

Smells like socks to me. Of course, I respect your opinion, but I'm not convinced that the term is more than generic words without specific context. Cheers, \n\nA: Actually, I followed up with the person who added that, which happened shortly before I decided to comment (see their talk page). I really don't think those templates were warranted in the case of this AfD and if they are all socks, they are having one heck of a time debating each other on the notability of the topic on the article's talk page... \n\nB: Those 4 users have only contributed to either the AfD, the talk, or a couple of added refs on the article - and nothing else. I really cannot be bothered to sort out who is a sock or meatpuppet of whom; more important is, there is absolutely nothing to assert notability - per the review of the references now added by Rankiri at the bottom. \n\nA: I suppose we'll have to agree to disagree. Other than the one AfD participant who hasn't done anything on the article, I don't see evidence of sockpuppets. As for meatpuppets, none of them seem to have really done any \"!voting\" in the AfD, mainly it has amounted to lots of discussion (and heated disagreement) on the AfD and article's talk page. To be honest, I'm not surprised at the turnout of editors for a topic of this type. My issue here is there is no reason for deletion if the article can be improved via normal editing (ie wiki_link) and that has been taking place. As for Rankiri's review, it has already been pointed out by someone else how he managed to miss a bunch of stuff so there is no reason for me to repeat it here. \n","281":"A: == Images ==\n\n\nB: The licensing updates you have made are incorrect.

Their greatest majority are Alevi. All these things that they are Kurds and half sunni are made up by the Kurdish nationalists. I propose to reduse the number of Zazas from the figures when they are mentioned separately. The Kurdish organizations'numbers are exaggerated any way and Zazas are only native to Turkey. So they cannot change the overal picture dramatically. \n\nA: I agree that Zazas are not Kurds, that's precisely my point. But, as you probably now, they are (incorrectly) considered Kurds 99% of the time. CIA's Worldfactbook is incredibly simplistic; it just says \"80% Turkish, 20% Kurdish\" for demographics of Turkey. It's very safe to say that they included the number of Zazas to Kurds. By the way, the number of people who actually speak Kurdish is different from the number of people who consider themselves Kurds. I'll come back to that. There is a report on demographics of Turkey from 2007. I think that's the best source we can use for now. \n\nB:  this is true many Kurds in Turkey do not speak Kurdish any more. :::: In general I think that CIA is simplistic but underestimates the number of Kurds. It also does not mention the numbers of Assyrians, Laz, Armenians, Pomaks, Circassians etc... While the same  CIA has fantasy figures about the ethnic groups of Iran which contradicts its own linguistic and religious figures. Why?  well let's do not get into the politics. Counting the Vilayets in Turkey which are Kurdish and adding to that number number of Kurds in Istanbul, Ankara, izmir, Konya etc... results in a higher figure, something close to 20 Mln Kurds. Number Zazas according to the same method would be 5 mln.  These are very possible in Turkey. A country with 72 mln inhabitants. \n\nA: Actually CIA overestimates their numbers, not as much as you do though. I'll try to translate that report a little. It seems the report on the survey I was talking about was already mentioned in \"Zaza people article\". I'll use that as a reference in other article. \n\nB:  It is better not using the Turkish sources but sue other sources. Kurdish nationalists will be there and make a lot of trouble for you in that article. \n\nA: Most figures for the number of Kurds in Turkey aren't based on recent datas, they are estimates based on datas from 1930s, 1960s, 1980s. This report is based on a recent survey and the organization which conducted is more reliable than any website we could find about this issue. Actually it was heavily criticized by Turkish nationalists (mainly for different reasons) \n\nB:  In Turkey most people are nationalist in one way or another. many are extreme nationalist and Imperialists who want some kind of Ottoman empire. many are Kemalist and nationalist, Many are Panturkist who love to make trouble with Turkey's neighbors. Many are Islamist who are sometimes called Islamic nationlist Turks. some are propenents of Ak Party, which in fact propses a liberal nationalism, which isnt that bad. Which nationalists do you mean? \n\nA: I agree nationalism is the norm in Turkey. AKP is definitely not nationalist by Turkish standards. There are two types of nationalists mainly; CHP (Kemalists) and MHP (Grey Wolves). Old school pan-Turkists are a tiny minority. This organization was criticized by Kemalists, if I recall correctly. \n\nB:  You probably mean the Young Turks. Right? I think Ataturk vs. Young Turk adversary was just for show. They were from the same backgrounds of movements. Kemalists can be agressive and as they tend to serve foreign interests they can become many times very anti-Nationalist. Grey Wolves (MHP)are extreme and as they soon or later cause problems with or inside Turkey's neighbors, they are detriomental to Turkey's interest. \n\nA: What do you mean Kemalists serve foreign interests? \n\nB:  They serve USA's interetsts. \n","285":"A: == Middle East ==\n\n\nB: Turkey and Cyprus, should go in the core of the Middle East, not greater.  There is a pretty solid consensus about Turkey in the talk page.  As for Transcaucasia it doesn't belong at all.  Now, stop removing Anatolia from the Middle East.  It's geographically part of it, and that's a fact. \n\nA: Fact how? \n\nB: Look up any Atlas, Encyclopedia, or map of the middle east.  Wikipedia is based on sources, not opinions.  I can bring tens of sources that say Anatolia is geographically part of the middle east.  I bet you won't find any that say otherwise.  Let's keep this source, not opinion-based, as per wikipedia rules. \n\nA: Cyprus was not Middle Eastern as it was culturally European some hours ago, now you sacrifice it to keep Turkey in Middle East ) Middle East is not \"geographical region\". It overlaps with national borders. It's a list of countries, basically. Turkey (along with Cyprus and Transcaucasia) is sometimes included, sometimes not  \n\nB: OK, talking to you is a total waste of time.

Goodbye. \n","286":"A: ==Omar Sharif==\n\n\nB: Hi Nableezy. I was actually not checking your contributions this time but you came up twice on my watchlist. I didn't want to chime in at the noticeboards since it boarders on wikistalking and I don't want to come across as trying to influence a discussion that I'm not part of. So my two cents: wiki_link is important as you pointed out. However, you may be ignoring wiki_link. Although a transcript would be appreciated for wiki_link I am under the impression that it is not a necessity. If Arab Cowboy (that part was stalkerish) or Cleo need to give more details so the reader can track it down (email, phone call, movie rental, extra extra googling, or whatever) it should be considered. It is also a BLP which requires even more caution.  If the guy can be verified as not saying it is so then it really needs to be spelled out in the article (\"x has been reported. Dude says y\" \n\nA: I am not ignoring that. There has to be a physical record that about this interview, something being shown on TV once is not enough, especially given the number of sources that contradict this supposed interview. And, since you brought it up, the policy says ''Verifiability, in this context, means that anyone should be able to check the sources to verify that material in a Wikipedia article has already been published by a reliable source''. That is not possible by just saying Sharif said something on TV once. '''''' - \n\nB: \"Ignore\" was incorrectly worded then. If you can call the station and order a transcript it is verifiable. You need more info from the editor(s) before that is even possible though. \n","287":"A: == October 2009 ==\n\n\nB: You currently appear to be engaged in an '''wiki_link'''. Notthat the wiki_link prohibits making more than three reversions on a single page within a 24 hour period. Additionally, users who perform several reversions in content disputes may be blocked for edit warring even if they do not technically violate the wiki_link. When in dispute with another editor you should first try to wiki_link to work towards wording and content that gains a wiki_link among editors. Should that prove unsuccessful, you are encouraged to seek wiki_link, and in some cases it may be appropriate to request wiki_link.

Stellarkid's sole purpose at this article has been to edit war out a name that he does not like. Users have said that they accept that it has been used as a name but they want to remove it because it is \"defamatory\" to Israel. There has been a consistent push to eliminate a significant POV, which NPOV requires we include, by a set of editors. It is difficult to restrain myself to just allow that set of editors to continually remove something that they find personally objectionable. I find many things that are cited to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs objectionable, but I have not removed them, in fact I have put them in and reverted to keep them in. '''''' - \n\nA: Quite fascinating.  Now here are ''your'' reverts from the past few weeks.  I included your commentaries, my comments are in italics. The vast majority of these are ''straight reverts'', with no reference to the discussion being held in TALK regarding issues of wiki_link, wiki_link, wiki_link, wiki_link, wiki_link, wiki_link. The very day the protection period was over you rushed in and reverted ''again'' to the most hotly debated text without getting agreement on the TALK page: * ( restore started per the sources, this is specifically about the Gaza War; change to called by Hamas, treat both Cast Lead and Gaza massacre as names from the governments) ''reinserted Massacre'' *   (Undid revision 316440696 by Brewcrewer (talk) yes and you need to show consensus has changed, no consensus for removal of long standing text) * (there is no consensus for the removal of this text and verifiable sources have been provided on talk and at the end of the *  (Revert to revision 316682478 dated 2009-09-28 13:56:50 by 77.127.53.97 using popups) * rv, the sources cited show \"people in Gaza\" using that name, your belief that it is not real does not matter) * (there is no consensus for this change, open an RfC if you wish) * (Undid revision 317725599 by AgadaUrbanit (talk) this is amply sourced and an RfC is open) * (Undid revision 317733746 by AgadaUrbanit (talk) an RfC is ongoing and 10 different sources have been provided) *  (this source should end this)''changes the lead from Hamas to Arab world'' *  (Undid revision 318200531 by Stellarkid (talk) nonsense, the text is directly supported by the citations) *  (here is an actual compromise)''reverted back to embolden, and capitalized'' '''One week of locked then Protected Gaza War: Edit warring \/ Content dispute ([edit=sysop] (expires ) [move=sysop] (expires )))''' *  (move up, bold and capitalize per source)''reverted to the most disputed version'' * (Undid revision 320039469 by Stellarkid (talk) removal of reliably cited and there is no consensus to completely remove gaza massacre) * (Undid revision 320078418 by Stellarkid (talk) again, completely removing \"gaza massacre\" with no consensus) If this is collaborative editing, you sure have put one over on me! It is clear to anyone who takes the time (the horrors) of looking back over the archives of this that there has really not been a 10-month consensus, but merely an ongoing enforcement, similar to what you and a couple others have been doing on this page in the last few weeks.  Because editors have given up rather than get caught up in an edit war does not mean there was consensus to include this.  There have been numerous reasons\/policies given (per above) but you have ignored them.       Oh and I forgot to mention that you have only one source that supports you and at the same time follows the rules of English grammar! A shocking willingness to editwar your POV into this article and a refusal to acknowledge the points made by a number of other editors as to why this particular edit is inappropriate and wrong in the lede. Not very WP nice. \n\nB: I really have no respect for you, so your moronic assertions that I only have 1 source or that I have a willingness to edit war while you think your actions are acceptable only annoy me. All you have contributed to that article is the removal of a term you dont like and bullshit. Nothing else. And you make the exact opposite argument depending on the POV advanced. Seeing as that is the case, kindly leave this talk page alone. But you have no idea what you are talking about. \"Gaza massacre\" barely came up in the past 10 months. But you cant be bothered to actually give a factual argument.

But Mmm Papi isn't nothing compared to wiki_link. \n\nB: I'm torn with \"Mmm Papi\".

So please, stop being such a hypocrite \n","292":"A: ==Similarities to War of the Worlds==\n\n\nB: I could avoid \"weasel wording\" by describing precisely how the plot is the same as wiki_link (aliens come and attack Earth, are defeated by viruses, etc.), but then it becomes original research as all the sources I can find that meet all of Wikipedia's 758 requirements that confront this issue are sensible enough to describe it as something like \"a cursory retelling with a small twist\". Would a reputable plot summary of the WotW novel along with one of the ID film be enough? My suspicion is that because it wouldn't actually point out the similarities, it wouldn't be enough. Can I appeal to wiki_link? \n\nA: While it is obvious that it is an \"update\" of sorts of WOTW, the common sense mentality would apply. But a statement of such would be better suited in the production section with sources of the filmmakers specifically explaining the inspiration. Listing a spoiler is no longer a concern; Wikipedia even discourages using the spoiler tag. But placing a statement beginning with \"some felt\" indicates hearsay and opinion, and adding a source only indicates the same of those mentioned. Placing this in the \"critical response\" section of a film article can indicate a positive\/negative impression of the film inherent only to the statement. It'd be best to list a notable critic's explanation as to why the similarites to WOTW was advantageous or detrimental to the movie. - \n\nB: Fair enough. I'll drop this as I have no interest in looking through either loads of interviews to find the writers' inspiration or a lot of major reviews to try and find a mention of the similarities and how they impact the quality. Half of one of your sentences suggests that you misunderstood what I was doing with the sources, but it doesn't affect your argument, so I don't see any point in debating it. \n\nA: I think the computer virus was a modern homage to the biological virus from War of the Worlds. And El Toro plays a role in both movies (the original, not the Tom Cruise version). This, plus the fact that there's an alien invasion, what else does this movie really have in common with the novel? - \n\nB: Well there's also the force field that was added in the 1953 movie, although that's not much a homage as it is a necessity that today's world is so dangerous the only way to stop our weapons is through a force field. As much as it took from WotW there's also a hell of a lot from V, which I think was a mini-series. The saucers were a lot smaller but still big, and there were many of them each hovering over a major city. and then communicating with each other through a countdown, but that's where it ends where V sends an ambassador to the United Nations and this movie sends a payload of destruction \n","293":"A: == References to other films ==\n\n\nB: I really don't see why someone keeps deleting some obvious references to other films while leaving in some that are far more tenuous. Please don't. \n\nA: Give a '''''very''''' good reason why I should not, one that would seem logical considering following the polices and guidelines of wikipedia, and how stuff go about here. See, when I removing the trivial stuff, it is per wiki_link; trival stuff are discouraged, and if an article has these kinds of sections it will never reach a wiki_link wiki_link. And some of the trivial stuff people are adding seem like wiki_link; people just adding random stuff. Plus, some of the trivia is taken from IMDb. I dont need to explain again why I remove it. So, when I remove the trivial stuff, I considering, like 1 guideline, 1 policy, and 2 articles on how to get this article to a good article status. So, what your reason why I shoud not remove the trivia? And if you think the other refernces are tenuous, then remove them. \n\nB: One of the things that made ID such a good film is that it is so knowing, such a conscious film. The references to other films are a large part of that. By removing the references to them you are showing that you don't really understand what the director is trying to do. I won't get into an edit war with you about this but you are making the article worse not better and so less likely to get Good Article status. \n\nA: \"so less likely to get Good Article status\"? Making the article worse? You dont know anything about getting an article to GA-class if you really think that. You act as if you really know what the director was trying to do. You certainly ''do not''. You only speaking from a fan's point of view. Your not really speaking from a Wikipedian's POV. I like this movie and yet I can still see whats wrong with this article. Your reason is not a very good reason. You are not considering the polices and guidelines. \n\nB: No, you are simply ignorant and wrong. \n","294":"A: ==Rochdale==\n\n\nB: I've put the bio tag back on John de Byron. So far as I am aware, the 'Lord' is not a peerage title, but merely the lordship of the manor of Rochdale - a transferable or saleable thing. When you find English 'titles' for sale, this is what they are. Nowadays, they are just a paper exercise. See wiki_link for the modern peerage Rochdale title. No dates are given, making the article somewhat problematical in terms of usefulness. A Sir John whose title was \"wiki_link of Rochdale\" was the ancestor the later infamous Lord Byron,  This Sir John Byron was created Baron Byron of Rochdale and did not inherit his title - and was not de Byron. \n\nA: All issues that should be sorted out and maybe the article should be deleted. However, I am trying hard to strictly apply A7 because it is too often used when an editor just sort of thinks something isn't notable and that is not what A7 is for. ::Wasn't it me who put the bio tag on though? I'm confused. :::Maybe the simplest solution is that the article could be turned into a stub on whoever the most notable John de Byron was. Just a sentence or two and a couple of reliable sources. Otherwise you could consider PROD tagging it with detailled reasons as to why he isn't notable and if this is rejected with a plausible reason then take it to AfD. \n\nB: Looks like there is a whole host of articles added by this individual. This may be best dealt with as a group. \n\nA: It was Minor4th who tagged it bio. You later tagged it notability after declining my replacement bio. Yeah, it looks like someone has been digging into dusty tomes. Most of the notability of this bunch of characters depends entirely on their eventual descendant THE Lord B. Insanity can be inherited from one's kids, but can notability over so many generations? The Lords Byron were a fairly notable bunch (including one known as 'Mad Jack'...)

As I previously added on the wikipedia page, the Young Buckethead DVD liner notes place his birth around 1972 since Jas Obrecht states that he first met Buckethead when he dropped off his demo in 1988 and that Brian was 16 at the time. \n\nA: I remember checking this recently when I tidied up the lead sentence. I was going to remove the birth year, then spotted it in one of the references. But for the life of me, I can't find it now. If you want to change the year, put what you've just said in a footnote and don't forget to change the category. \n\nB: I'm just putting it out there, I'm not entirely sure myself. Furthermore, the liner notes don't offer more on the subject to make it more clear. Claiming that he was 16 in 1988 doesn't even pinpoint which year he was born in, depending of course on the time of the year versus his birth day. In the DVDs, where he's talking at least, he does seem quite young (though that could be older footage), and supposedly his parents brought him to drop off his demo tape, so I'm inclined to believe he is younger. However, this could all be deliberate misinformation on his part. \n","299":"A: == Distructive edit patterns ==\n\n\nB: Every guitarist page has a gear section. And all could be better sourced. For players like Buckethead... 90% of the article's readers viewing that page are going to be gearheads. Creating encyclopedic\/sourced gear sections is one of the mandates of the Guitarist Project. Unfortunately there are editors who are unfamiliar with the Wiki-project's \"work-in-progress\" plans and every now and then you see distructive edits external_link. Personally, I am a staunch deletionist. But I know how Wiki is supposed to \"play to its audience\" as well. If someone tried to delete Eric Clapton or David Gilmour or Jimmy Page's gear sections there would be a mutiny. Like all of the others, they are very long and detailed... but require better sourcing. \"Gear\" information what guitar players use these pages as a reference for. That is the \"reliable information\" they come here looking for. Trick is... making it reliable. Hard to do when it isn't there to build on. - \n\nA: wiki_link. If content is not sourced and someone thinks it's remotely controversial, they can remove it, simple as that. I suggest you learn to use a sandbox if you want to put content somewhere while you look for reliable sources. \n\nB: That won't be needed. I will just continue to respect the mandate of a Wikipedia Project that they will replace the source that has been given with the actual authored content from Harmony Central... the \"source of the source\". I am not a member of that project. But I am familiar with the edit histories of the projects regular editors and I can certainly trust that they will continue to be a very active and reliable project. Makes it easy to wiki_link that they will find the wiki_link. There is nothing controversial here. There are no opinions being soapboxed. Its just a gear list. No different than any other guitarist article gear lists. There are hundreds of them. And they all look the same. - \n\nA: From wiki_link: ''The burden of evidence lies with the editor who adds or restores material. All quotations and any material challenged or likely to be challenged should be attributed to a reliable, published source using an inline citation.'' wiki_link has nothing to do with this issue. Assuming good faith simply means assuming that whoever added the content meant well. That doesn't mean they were right to do so. Also, this article is not edited exclusively by wikiproject guitarist members. Wikiprojects can't overrule wiki_link. Incidently, I'm a member of Wikiproject Guitarists and I know of no such mandate. Care to point me to it? I also don't understand what you mean regarding Harmony Central, can you clarify please? Not all the gear lists look the same, some are reliably sourced; that's the central issue. \n\nB: OK... The issue has not been addressed and from my own searching I conclude that the content is derived from various forum discussions (presumably ultimately from fans who have seen Buckethead using various equipment). Thus it probably violates wiki_link as well as wiki_link. The source currently in the article is not reliable. The content can be added in again, only if a reliable source can be found to support it. The deleted content can easily be found by looking through the edit history; I have also kept a copy in my user space. As it happens, the '90%' or people looking for this information can easily find it by googling 'Buckethead gear'. \n\nA: And that information will be found here. And someday a valid ref will be added to it. Thats how Wiki works. As before... there is nothing controversial here. This isn't information that is drastically lowering the dependability of Wikipedia (it has none to start with) There is no violation of wiki_link here. It's just gear. All gear that is out there for everyone to see. It can be deleted it is blatantly wrong. But that would also take a citation. It's unthreatening and perfectly fine the way it is and it can patiently stay that way until a cite comes along. - \n\nB: It's not how wiki works. Again, read the '''policies''': wiki_link, wiki_link. The speculative and incoherent crap you're spouting doesn't change them. \n","300":"A: == Tour Dates ==\n\n\nB: The tour dates are an important part of an article about a tour and is not a vilation of wiki_link. They should be kept. Thoughts? \n\nA:  No, because they violate wiki_link \n\nB: wiki_link doesnot include tour dates. They have always been a part of articles about tours. On what basis are you indicating wiki_link could you please clarify? \n\nA: Yes it is important \n","301":"A: == Tour Dates ==\n\n\nB: I know that Tour dates are important, but they violate wiki_link, so we shouldn't add them on the article \n\nA: That's what I'm asking you continuously that why are you referring to wiki_link? They donot include tour dates. Don't you understand simple English? *Shrug* \n\nB: \"A complete exposition of all possible details. Rather, an article is a summary of accepted knowledge regarding its subject.[4] Treat verifiable and sourced statements with appropriate weight.\" :You're very aggressive with me now! wiki_link says that tour dates shouldn't be on articles \n\nA: That nowhere proves your point. You know very well that a surplus of information will come once the tour starts on March 12. you have a baseless argument here. \n\nB: I know that, but tour dates ARE NOT necessary as they violate wiki_link \n\nA: Ohh so you know that your logic is flawed, you know very well that tour dates are not a part of wiki_link, but still would present your absurd theory. Great! \n\nB: No, I know that the article will expanse now that the tour is started, but I know that tour dates aren't necessary as they violate wiki_link. And please, don't talk with that tone of superiority \n\nA: You are getting on my nerve . I'm continuously telling you that tour dates are not a part of wiki_link unless you are pointing at your own NOTDIR. Do I need to spell it out to you? \n\nB: Yes I am. And I cannot keep good faith in you anymore when you are definitely lying. Just show me where wiki_link mentions tour dates. I have a feeling it is because of your anti-feeling towards this article from the beginning that you are making baseless points. Regarding tour dates you cannot provide a valid reason. You have to first edit 1000000s of other touring articles before you even come here. \n\nA: I've already show you: \"A complete exposition of all possible details. Rather, an article is a summary of accepted knowledge regarding its subject.[4] Treat verifiable and sourced statements with appropriate weight.\" This does not refer explicitly to the tour dates, but it's involved. \n\nB: Thats your thought. If you want an opinion, go to the wiki_link project page and get your clarifications, or get tour dates included in NOTDIR. Untill then this discussion is completely baseless. Don't create a wiki_link situation. I would also advice you to read wiki_link. \n\nA: Agreed, 100% \n\nB: I've just asked wiki_link and an user aswered me that only '''significantly notable''' tours should have tour dates. The Fame Ball tour isn't, so I delete them \n\nA: How dare you do that? Who is this user that you are basing your comments on? And who the hell told you that ''this'' tour isn't notable? I repeat don't dare to delete them, if you think this is a warning, yes it is, because normal English seems to evade your mind while taking judgment.

There is an individual who keeps creating sockpuppets to vandalize the article.  Here are the sockpuppets. wiki_link.  This is the latest sockpuppet . This is the version of the article that is the external_link. Thank you \n\nA: Technically you were in an edit war, even though you were just trying to keep the article in good shape.  In the future, it'll be easier on you if you go through the proper channels to get the sock blocked instead of continually reverting.  I'd suggest that you look at getting an account and then possibly using Huggle and Twinkle which will automate a lot of the reporting and administrator notification tasks.  Take a look at the version in my namespace (the link is above) and see what you think about it now.  It's pretty much the version you linked to above, though I took out some inflamatory wording. \n\nB: Note that if you get an account, it will be possible to deal with this sort of thing by semi-protecting the article.  If you don't have an account, semi-protecting will block you just as much as the sock-puppeteer. \n\nA: Hi Looie, I appreciate the sound advise, but I am not going to be staying much longer.  Would you be willing to police the RRQ article?  Perhaps, a few of you can do it. Good luck. \n\nB: I'll keep an eye on the article just in case there are new sockpuppets. I've opened up an investigation into Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois1837 at wiki_link. I'd be amazed if it wasn't another sock.  '''''' \n\nA: I'll keep this on my watchlist as well.  You were absolutely trying to do the right thing, you just went about it in the wrong manner.  Hopefully we can catch any future socks before they cause as much trouble as this one did. \n","303":"A: == Rewrite ==\n\n\nB: I've started a rewrite external_link If anyone has issues with the wording of this article, please leave a message on my talk page and we'll try to work on this collaboratively.  When the block expires, we'll see if we can't get this article into shape without having to revert each other all the time. \n\nA: This page is perfect, it clearly say that the RRQ was manifesting at the Saint-Patrick parade because they claim it was too English. But the part about L'Autre St. Jean have nothing to do on this article. In the reference it clearly say that it was the JPQ (Jeunes Patriotes) who were manifesting, not the RRQ. Only one member of the RRQ was there. Maybe we should also write that a RRQ member have been seen watching a Habs game in 2008 (Sarcasm). Also this page is a clear case of racism. You block all French Quebecers without exception claiming they are sockpuppet, I will make a complaint about that. \n\nB:  Also the part where it say the RRQ is not a recognized political party in the province of Quebec. I want to say that the RRQ never claim to be a political party. It is a militant organisation working for the independence of Qu\u00e9bec with Manifestation, Radio, Journal, ect... \n\nA: You're completely wrong and full of hot air. French Quebecers are perfectly welcome to Wikipedia. One particular French Quebecer (you) is disruptive and has been blocked, and keeps making accounts trying to pretend to be different people. And those accounts are going to be blocked every time. So as I said before on another page, just give up. You're just wasting everyone's time, including your own. If you were to make a '''sincere''' effort to work with other editors on the content and not just be a political activist we wouldn't need to block you anymore.

'''''' \n\nB: While that happens too (and we have sources for that), this source says \"For instance, a sh\u00f4jo story about a girl who \ufb01nds herself in ancient China might include sexy images of her designed to appeal to the more prurient interests of male fans. Such \u2018fan service\u2019 is thought to draw male readers or viewers to sh\u00f4jo genres.\" Which I've boiled down to what I said there. \n\nA: Both are true, especially when a work is adapted to anime. I will note the reverse is also true; shonen series having bishionen characters to draw female readers, fe Black Butler. Finding a RS for that may be a bit harder though. \n\nB: I'm really sorry, I missed the \"potential\". This is about the crossover aspect, where girl manga try to appeal to male readers as well. The sentence would fit better after \"Male homoeroticism, such as accidental kisses, is a common feature of fan service for females, and has been described as \"easier to get away with\" in terms of censorship than fanservice for males.\" We could add, after that sentence, \"Shoujo manga series may eroticise its female leads as well for crossover appeal, as fan service aimed at a potential male audience. '''''' \n\nA: Yeah, I could go for that change.  Another piece of information I would like to include comes from wiki_link - external_link.

Please heed your own hatnote's warning about being polite, positive, and constructive. \n\nA: It should have been obvious to anyone with even the vaguest understanding of wiki_link that the image was desperately lacking.

And if you didn't know that that image failed the NFCC, then your understanding of the relevant policy is, sadly, too basic to justify your working in that area.

Both wiki_link and wiki_link had non-free images in their infoboxes when they were promoted to FA, and as the fair-use rationale for the eye image says that it's a pivotal moment in the episode, it's reasonable to say that it's both essential to the article and non-replaceable.  It is possible for people to disagree with you without lacking familiarity with our policies: your claim that an image fails policy is not to be trusted any more or any less than anyone else's claim. \n\nA: You're just being ridiculous now.

I was linking to the article for a discussion forum post on a site I've been a member of for some nine years (much longer than I've been a Wikipedian). \n\nA: Well that's going well so far.  I don't think I've seen any vandals since page protection, and clearly they're not interested in identifying themselves to subsequently be banned. \n","319":"A: ==Southern Sudan and South Sudan==\n\n\nB: Apparently somebody made a copy-paste move from wiki_link to wiki_link, is it possible to make some kind of histmerge? If it is not possible could the Southern Sudan's history be moved to the second? . Grammatically incorrect? '''Correct it!''' \n\nA: *GROAN!* People do some strange things. Let me see what the problem is...  | \n\nB: The new page was heavily based off of the old page and was the product of large-scale collaboration for weeks. Please explain your decision to blanket revert and wipe out all of the updates made to bring this page into the present day. - \n\nA: What the fuck are you on? You make a mess like that, and then you come here and demand ''I'' explain ''my''self? I think not. You made a wiki_link, creating a huge mess in the process and violating 1300 editors' attribution rights, not to mention the drain on the servers that it's taken to clean up your mess. If you can't or won't move a page properly, don't try. Leave it to someone else. Or better yet, get consensus first and then ask an admin to do it.  | \n","320":"A: == Edit warring ==\n\n\nB: You wrote on my talk page: \"I've asked you to stop edit-warring. Do I need to ask again or do I need to get an administrator to ask you? TruthIIPower (talk) \" I answer that you certainly have a lot of nerve. You have been pushing a nonconsensus agenda. You have been edit-warring. By all means, bring in an administrator. I think it's high time. \n\nA: I understand completely: you refuse to stop edit warring. \n\nB: One more time: if you think I'm edit-warring, make your case to the admins, or stop making the accusation. I believe your conduct is detrimental to the articles you're working on, and the encyclopedia more generally. Please direct your considerable energy in more cooperative, collaborative ways. \n\nA: Words about cooperation and collaboration would be more convincing if they came from soemone who didn't repeatedly edit war.  As it stands, I can only dismiss them as self-serving. \n","321":"A: ==Fact check==\n\n\nB: external_link.  You need to get out more, spot. - \n\nA: The above comment has been redacted to remove a childish insult.  I've asked this person not to call me \"spot\" or \"love\" or \"madam\", but they persist.  The next occurance will result in administrative intervention. \n\nB: Big words my friend, big words.  In any case, per the comments you left on my talk page - Islam cannot be grouped together as a single religion and none of its individual sects have more adherents than Catholicism. - \n\nA: Right, Islam's not a religion at all, it's a club for men and women who like to wear robes.  You figured them out.  Oh, the things people due to get the tax advantages given to REAL religions, like that of the Catholics and Jedis. (outdent) \n\nB: I think this could be solved by saying that Catholicism is the world's largest religious denomination, and Islam is the second-largest religion. TruthIIPower, I think you may have missed the point that Schrandit was trying to make about the denominations of Islam. \n\nA: The context was his off-hand claim, in an edit comment, that we shouldn't offend Catholics because they're the biggest religion in the world.  I found this offensively self-serving, not to mention factually incorrect.  His dismissal of the entirety of Islam on the basis that there's no Muslim Pope shows that he sees the world through Catholic-colored glasses. \n\nB: I in no way said that and am offended by your attempts to besmirch my good name.  Your ignorance of the Muslim faith is just as shameful as your ignorance of Catholicism. - \n","322":"A: ==2003 iraq invasion==\n\n\nB: Not sure how that last massive revert came in there. It wasn't mine, all I changed was I've been deleting the POV \"unprecedented terrorism\" remarks. Just letting you know that it didn't come from me.   oh ps I'll be monitoring here for response if any, no need to come to my talk page. \n\nA: nope, it wasn't you i was trying to revert. i agree with your edit, but had already gotten rid of that phrase earlier and went further. It was external_link by 84.59.108.128, who mass reverted external_link of edits by me. I had changed \"Decisive Coalition victory; Iraqi regime toppled; occupation of Iraq; emergence of insurgency and unprecedented terrorism\" to \"wiki_link and wiki_link toppled; wiki_link; emergence of wiki_link\". \n\nB:  oh ok, I've come under fire for reverting so many times, so I've made a request for final consensus on the bottom of the talk page, and included your section in. Please vote? :::::Could you please vote in that talk page? That annoying anon is going around like an asshole, and hunting down liberal members of wikipedia to back him up on the vote. \n","323":"A: == Stop Reverting without providing any Evidence ==\n\n\nB: I have provided plenty of evidence and citations and argumentation for my changes.  Your strategy has been a ridiculous avoidance of many points, responding to one which basically just states that you disagree or you pull some POV card, citing no evidence and reverting.  You need to think harder instead of clicking revert harder. \n\nA: see no. 2 at wiki_link. I told you that I'm not interested in participating in a political debate with you. As long as some people will disagree with the text, then it is not acceptable. It doesn't matter if we both agree with the text as long as ''some'' people disagree. I fail to see that Taiwan's status as a nation is not disputed ''at all'', so showing me \"evidence and citations\" on how Taiwan is a nation, as long as some people claim otherwise, does little good. \n\nB: You're the one pushing POV and if anything, you're pushing a minority POV.  You still won't read the argument and you still won't respond to any of the facts about Taiwanese culture and traditions.  And really dumb is you STILL think nation=ethnic group.  Why the hell do you sitll think that?  Please read wiki_link because you sound like you have no clue. \n","324":"A: ==Your opinion is requested==\n\n\nB: I wish to inform you that I am not at all happy that you have turned my FAC into a forum for your public service announcement. Having said that, I will reluctantly concede a point that the issue should be settled once and for all, so here you go: wiki_link. My argument and your argument have been (very simplistically) summed up there, and as the title suggests, I seek and ammendment to the MILHIST MoS to settle this once and for all. As a gesture of fairiness and of good faith, I leave the link to the discuss here directly and your talk page since you were the first to bring the issue up. I wish you luck with your argument in the forum, no matter how it turns up. \n\nA: It's not ''your'' FAC page, it's not ''your'' article, and I haven't yet made a \"public service announcement\" about sexist language. It's quite a good article, BTW. \n\nB: By \"mine\" I mean its my responibility as the nominator of the article to adress the the concerns brought up with objects and\/or comments in accordance with the FAC guidelines. In no way should \"mine\" be construed as me claiming the article for myself, that goes against policy since no contributer here can own an article. As for the \"public service announcement\", I mean bring the issue up directly on the FAC instead of a MoS related talk page; although having taken a step back from the issue just a little I can say that my \"public service announcement\" comment was just a little over the line. For that, I apologize. \n","325":"A: ==Macau FAC==\n\n\nB: I can bet my life, definitely this time you will vote oppose to this article a bit later for sure; no exception, as you are quite nit-picking for non-Australian\/British articles.  But would you please kindly give me some concrete opinions for improving the article instead of vote? \n\nA: This is a serious accusation. I don't know where you got the idea that I favour articles from certain places. Nominators from the UK and Australia think I'm hard on them. \n\nB: Excuse me for butting in but, in my experience, Tony has one set of standards which he applies equally to all articles he reviews. I have seen no hint of bias at all. \n\nA: Whatever, from what I have seen is, this person (I very carefully observe this person for more than 1 year) only gave very superficial reasons like incorrect use of tenses, vocabs, etc that could be fixed in few minutes.  No matter how much correction have been done by nominators, he wouldn't re-consider his vote or objection for sure.  When someone asked him how to improve their articles, he might simply said he is not obliged to do so or not be able to help to fix up (please refer to his conservation - Russia FAC that he just archived).  Although you tried to defense him and deny everything, I am sorry but I do think his work is '''not''' coterminous with that of FAC here. \n\nB: I think reviewers are not supposed to edit. Nominators are obliged to do whatever suggestions have been given. \n\nA: Reviewers are not obliged to edit nominations, but can if they wish. \"Nominators are expected to respond positively to constructive criticism and to make an effort to address objections.\" Heavens, Coloane has certainly built up a head of resentment over the past 12 months. I'd never heard of her\/him. \n\nB: The original spirit to give comment is mainly to improve articles in general.  Reviewers are not obliged to give their opinions as well or even come here to logon according to your way of ridiculous thinking.  Well, something I didn't bring it up here is when the nominators bring back their articles to re-nominate, their improvement are sometimes contradicted to what they did.  This is the most laugable thing but I just feel sick of it.  That is why I don't support this way of nomination.  Contructive criticism is a vague term and debatable.  There is no strict guideline to scrutinize anyway.  You can basically do whatever you want. \n\nA: So get the gigantic chip off your shoulder and stop the personal attacks. \n\nB: Again, most people abuse these concepts: bad faith, personal attacks, etc.  These are not excuses to protect yourself and conceal what you are doing.  When I try to waste my time and write something here, of course I have my own reason.  You should politely accept and make your own self-review but not deny it right away.  Otherwise, you can't find out what's wrong going on and limit yourself to improve.  Regards! \n\nA: I won't be self-reviewing. Yes, you're wasting your time here. Go away. \n","326":"A: ==Thanks==\n\n\nB: Thanks for the wikicookie for the bio drive! yay! question: will there be a summer assessment drive or a fall one? \n\nA: I just stepped in to give the awards, using my admin status to replace any authority I had in WP:Bio (none).  I have no idea about future drives, but seeing as the guy responsible for this one went AWOL, who knows if there is anymore.  However, I have a constant drive of my own: get an Indiana article I started to GA, and I give an Indiana Barnstar; I'll give a Bluegrass Barnstar for those who do the same thing to one of my Kentucky articles. \n\nB: Thanks for my award, too. I'd almost forgotten about the drive! \n\nA: You're welcome. \n","327":"A: == Recent interchanges at DYK ==\n\n\nB: I happened to notice some recent interchanges at DYK involving yourself. I'd ask you to please try a bit harder to remain collegial, you seem to have gotten into a bit of a feud with other participants, which is somewhat unseemly. Someone with as many DYK contributions as yourself needs to set a good example for others, and that doesn't seem to be the case right now. Thanks. ++: \/ \n\nA: You would be better served rebuking Doncram for it, instead of me, as he's the one creating the problem.  As you didn't, but instead chose to rebuke m e, the protagonist to Doncram's antagonist, I can not respect this request. \n\nB: I'll look into that but the advice (not a rebuke, merely advice) stands. \"Be better than the other fellow \"has always served me well. Whether you \"respect\" the advice or not is your affair. Best wishes.  ++: \/ \n\nA: Since this seems to be related to this, I'm commenting here. Yes, I approved two of your hooks from that date. I asked, and will repeat the request on his talkpage, that Don not review your hooks anymore (frankly, I think, to avoid COI issues no one from one project should be the main reviewer of DYK hooks and GAs from another user of that project. And things like what's happened here). But you don't have to rub him the wrong way either. I feel we all get along great at NRHP, and am sad that you have chosen for the time being to delist yourself from it. However, this is purely from the DYK side of things. I really do like your hooks, and will probably add NRHP infoboxes to the articles I reviewed later. So I would like to see more efforts to get along (and, frankly, don shouldn't be reviewing your hooks). \n\nB: I do thank you.  I agree on those in same WPs not approving; its why I haven't approved the wiki_link or placed it on the next update, even through there are space for two US hooks on there right not.  As for removing myself, I will still work on those in Indiana and Kentucky, but due to ill will with Doncram, who runs the WP, I must remain separate for it unless her goes on a ling wikibreak. \n\nA:  Someone is in charge of wiki_link?  That's news to me.  I was under the impression that we were all just creating articles and engaging in various areas of historical geekery.  Aren't we all on the same team? \n\nB: Then he must be impersonating one, because he's always acted like he is. \n\nA: It is your choice to take a principled? stand against better referencing and to resign from wiki_link in a huff, or whatever, because you take offense, rather than responding reasonably, to my request that you do better in your referencing.  I am not in charge of wp:NRHP and have not ever pretended to be, I am just a wikipedian trying mostly to develop articles and lists on NRHPs.  I am rather amazed at your commitment to do poorer referencing, simply because i suggested you do better, and to otherwise sabotage the quality of your own articles.  And amazed at your taunting and insults.  I would have hoped that you and I would have had some better quality of relationship than that, so that you would have elected to respond to some constructive criticism more positively.  I believe that i handed you a number of DYK topics of interest to you as a Civil War buff, and that i handed you a great reference resource for numerous of your DYK articles on Civil War memorials.  But, whatever! \n\nB: I realize you have wiki_link, but please get over yourself.  You've gone out of your way to make an ass of yourself, and you've always acted like you are El Presidente of WP NRHP.  Enough. \n","328":"A: ==''[WIKI_LINK: Adenanthos terminalis]''==\n\n\nB: I wonder if you were aware, when you created this article, that your pal Ferdinand had painted this species.

Such a pity I can't find a scan online. -( \n\nA: I remember hunting for that work, maybe for that image, but I don't know ''how'' I would have known that. I do 'know', without having seen it, that it is the 'greatest botanical illustration' of ''Adenathos'' in history (unless he did another one).

Clear wiki_link. Left the user a warning and removed the links. No room on Wikipedia IMHO for people who link to copyright photographs.

The video is a re-upload of the viral. The original was taken down by the police. If you actually went on the info part of the YT video you would see there is a link to the newspaper - do some research and there is ample evidence that the video went viral.

If you have any evidence to back up what you say then by all means add it to the article. \n\nB: The evidence is the video and the news papers! Do some research, anyone can see that this is a real thing what happened. You can't keep removing something eveyone else knows is true - there was a newspaper article in the link I posted, see for yourself. \n\nA: With respect, I disagree. See wiki_link for an explanation of what makes a reliable source. If you can find published sources which document the incident then by all means put it back, but right now all you have is a single youtube video which is not in itself a reliable source. \n\nB: Your a vandal and I'm complaining - put 'Amesbury Double Decker Youtube' into google and there are a million news articles. \n","334":"A: == GA Question ==\n\n\nB: What, in your opinion, are the chances of getting an article such as wiki_link to GA status? - (UTC \n\nA: For starters, I smell a good deal of original research, especially the part about the lyrics and the plagues.

However, I forgot to look if there was a discussion.  I will be more careful next time.  But this shows that I am a very analytical and fair person because my own internal deliberations satisfied all points of view! \n\nA: Haha, not a problem. You not only solved the problem that people had with \"accident,\" but also my earlier point that \"Metro\" is both a bus and rail system, so that \"Metrorail\" should be used to distinguish. However, the WP standard seems to be \"Washington Metro\" to refer to the train system. So yes, you solved all the problems without even realizing it. ) A+!   \u00b7 \n\nB: I actually took that into consideration because I knew some people call it Metrobus and Metrorail.

It was my first two responses back to you - that I agree that they need to be updated. \n\nA: I've been edit conflicted three times; I've been multitasking doing other things; but will get back there in a moment.

Don't misunderstand me, I think you've got every reason to be upset, but this isn't the right way. \n\nA: If you think that serial plagiarism, wiki-stalking and harassment is fine - then fine. I think Uncle G should have rev -deleted the page at the time, but FAC was reeling from the Grace Sherwood scandal. I tried to help, but at this point am damned tired of the consequences and if you think I'm being vindictive, that's fine. All I see is that we shut our eyes to plagiarism to protect the FAC process (I'm included in the 'we') and we encourage the same behaviour over and over. \n\nB: I don't understand why you might imagine that I condone serial plagiarism, wiki-stalking or harassment, as I can assure that I most certainly do not. And I see nobody shutting their eyes to anything. A truth that may have escaped you though is that plagiarism is \u2013 mistakenly in my view \u2013 allowed on wikipedia, so long as there's some kind of acknowledgement somewhere. Indeed I had an argument about plagiarism fairly recently during a GA review IIRC, where I refused to accept it. But you have to look at where each article is now, not its genesis. \n\nA: Because you think I'm being vindictive when in fact all I think is that we need a clear policy. If the policy is to revert on sight, then it would have been impossible to scrub Miss Moppet, it would have gone straight through FAR, and probably be stubbified now. I ''am'' trying to make a point - we should have zero tolerance and everyone should know it. I shouldn't have to put up with this shit because someone is dishonest, or argue with you, who I consider a friend. They cheated and the page should go. And then no one deals with it later, no one cleans the mess, and we all get on with our business. And if I tell you that accusing me of wanting a star hurt, then I'll get another ten messages about being a pretentious bitch and needing smelling salts. \n","340":"A: == Lists ==\n\n\nB: According to the wiki_link, they serve three main purposes, of which navigation is but one. The other two are information and development. That is squarely where redlinks fall. If you wish to debate the purpose of lists please take this conversation to the wiki_link, or propose an AfD for the list to promote other editors' contributions.

This one specified \"Entries on this list are demonstrated as notable by having linked articles or being supported by reliable sources.\" Since you were adding red links ''without'' any reliable sources, your additions violated the ''existing'' list criteria for this specific list. As I had just cleaned up the list to comply with this list's criteria on May 26th, I don't appreciate your messing it up again. \n\nB: Please do not instigate edit wars according to your interpretation of WP guidelines, and note they are that: guidelines, not rules. They are not hard and fast. Here, they are open to consensus-driven decision-making; perhaps acting with civility would be prudent at this point. Please see my conversation on the wiki_link towards that end. \u2022 wiki_link'''' \n\nA: You have made no comments on the article talk page.

The edit was perfectly fine - the removed citation was for an irrelevant statistic that does not belong in the lead paragraph (there's a specific section for rankings of the UW's various colleges), not to mention the citation URL no longer worked. \n\nA: If you choose to edit as an IP, it would behoove you to explain your edits better. Your edit comment did not explain why you removed a reference. If you edit like that, it's not my responsibility to figure out what you did. It looked like unexplained vandalism and that's how I treated it. Don't like my attitude about anon IPs? Get an account. \n\nB: I ''did'' provide an edit summary, which either you chose to ignore completely or just wiki_link. An attitude like that is bound to stir up conflict, which is why Wikipedia encourages editors to follow a policy of reverting a wiki_link ''only after careful consideration''. From the looks of it, you blindly reverted my attempt at improving the article. And by the way, for future reference, there is no policy on Wikipedia that advocates treating unregistered editors with suspicion or less respect than registered  editors \u2014 this is Wikipedia,'' the encyclopedia anyone can edit''. There are, however, policies on assuming good faith. Don't like that attitude? Too bad, its not yours to decide. It just might behoove you to go wiki_link. \n\nA: The edit summary did not say why you were removing the reference. So I restored the reference. I don't think I was uncivil, but if you'd like me to be, I know how. You clearly have a dynamic IP, which makes it nearly impossible to communicate with you. I find being intentionally hard to communicate with a problem that impedes improving Wikipedia. Persisting in editing Wikipedia without a reliably static talk page when you know this can be a problem which can be easily resolved by registering just seems plain inconsiderate. And I respond to such intentional inconsideration poorly. Too bad, ain't it?  Buzz off and whine about how you should be treated the same as a registered user to somebody else. I don't buy it and never have. In the future, please use the talk page of the article involved rather than mine; since you don't bother maintain a static place to talk to you, why should I entertain you here? \n\nB: You undid all of the good edits along with the revert, which is bad practice. I'm pointing you toward better practice. And I don't care whether you ''feel'' like you were being uncivil or not, my point is that you need to assume good faith. By your own apparent admission, you don't seem to \"buy\" that rule. Unfortunately for you, assuming good faith and civility are policies, and not up for debate. And if you are unwilling to abide by those rules, you're free to buzz off Wikipedia. Also, I apologize that my IP is dynamic, but that is why I have brought the discussion here to your talk page \u2014 you know, to talk to ''you'' about ''your'' editing habits? \n\nA: But you reserve the right to not have a place where people can talk to you about your editing habits? Or ask you a question about about your edits? Sorry, not interested in maintaining that kind of communicative power imbalance. I asked you not to post on my talk page again. Don't do it. Posting on an editor's talk page after they have asked you not to is harassment and a blockable offense, you little hypocrite. \n","342":"A: == self-proclaimed ==\n\n\nB: This text is redundant - most states are self-proclaimed.  In 24 hours (just to be sure to avoid all interpretations of wiki_link), I will remove this text. \u00a6 \n\nA: That's not true. The majority of the world's states are states as they are recognised as such by other states. wiki_link is not a state as it is not recognised as one, even though it has far more state-like features than the SADR. The fact is that SADR is done so by about 40 or so. I really feel that the sentence 'The SADR is a state' is simply misleading and will be seen by others as offenisve and pov. In using this word I have simply tried to an alternative that reflects the contested nature of the SADR, which is needed (I think) in the intro perhaps 'disputed' would be a more acceptable caveat? \n\nB: Or even, based upon the amalgamation of recent changes: 'The '''Saharawi''' (or '''wiki_link''') '''wiki_link wiki_link''' ('''SADR''') (wiki_link:  \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0647\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u062d\u0631\u0627\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0645\u0642\u0631\u0637\u064a\u0629, wiki_link: Rep\u00fablica \u00c1rabe Saharaui Democr\u00e1tica) is a proposed wiki_link that does not currently control the majority of its claimed territory - the former wiki_link colony of wiki_link - and thus acts as a wiki_link. It was proclaimed on wiki_link, wiki_link by the wiki_link. Currently, Morocco administers the majority of the territory as its wiki_link, the rest is controlled by the wiki_link as the wiki_link.' ? \n\nA: It's a good option, anyway the introduction looks less controversial now. Best regards. \n","343":"A: ==attention==\n\n\nB: Well, the UN decides many things I think. Maybe the UN, the wiki_link and 80% of the countries of this world don't decide who is and isn't a sovereign state. Should we by then give this right to 46 countries? \n\nA: ===>'''Misconceptions about the UN''' The UN is not a government, and has no rights as an independent body - it's a forum of willing members. A state can be sovereign without the UN - for instance, states were sovereign before its creation, Switzerland wasn't a member for decades, and the Holy See still isn't. -, \n\nB: What about 147 states (80% of the world countires) especially 45 states which cancelled or froze their former recognition of this entity? \n\nA: ===>'''What about them?''' What do you want to know??? -, \n\nB: Why the SADR isn't recognised by 147 states (80% of the world countires) especially 45 states which cancelled or froze their former recognition of this entity? \n\nA: ===>'''It's impossible to say''' I don't know why something doesn't occur, in fact, it is wiki_link to prove or conclude anything from a wiki_link. -, \n\nB:  Some thing '''did occur''' since 45 states cancelled or froze their former recognition of this entity. There is a difference between \"don't know\" and \"don't want to know\". \n\nA: ===>'''Okay, you tell me''' What happened? And there is a difference, because you don't want to read the sources at arso or wsahara.net. You also don't want to admit the atrocities that Morocco committed against civilians. -, \n\nB: I agree with you, I really don't want to read your '''pro polisario propaganda'''. You don't want to admit the atrocities that polisario committed against the captives and POWs in the Tindouf camps of shame. SADR was and will always be a ghost entity without any legitimate status, 47 countries don't have the right to decide who is or isn't a sovereign state. \n\nA: ===>'''Like what?''' What atrocities? Can you give me some sources for this? I'll read them. -, \n\nB: You can check Amnesty international and other HR organizations reports. SADR was and will always be an Algerian backed ghost entity without any legitimate status, 47 countries don't have the right to decide who is or isn't a sovereign state. \n\nA: ===>'''Whatever.''' If it's so easy to find this inforamtion, give me a link. I have no idea what \"ghost entity\" means, but it's simply a historical fact that Polisario existed for years without Algerian support and even some hostility, so I have no idea where you are going with your argument about the SADR. If states don't have the \"right to decide,\" who does? -, \n\nB: Just out of interest, where in the article does it describe them as a sovereign state anyway? \n\nA: ===>'''wiki_link''' It explains the points of view of various actors. -, \n\nB: But it doesnt say they are sovereign, jsut that 45 nations recognise them as such, \n\nA: Well, what exactly are you asking for? The article does not say that this government possesses sovereign territorial control over Western Sahara, because it wiki_link. It has sovereign control over wiki_link, but not over the whole territory, and it is mainly based in exile. And that's precisely why it's a wiki_link. That does not preclude it from being recognized as the sovereign government, in the sense that it is the only government capable of making a legitimate decision on behalf of the territory and its people, or from being internally sovereign with respect to its own decisions. \n\nB: The sentence ''\"That does not preclude it from being recognized as the sovereign government, in the sense that it is the only government capable of making a legitimate decision on behalf of the territory and its people\"'' is completely untrue, stop this polisario propaganda. \n\nA: ===>'''How so?''' Do you care to explain? -, \n\nB: I'm exasperated by your stupid petulant jackass bullshit! Do you care to explain what and why you don't understand? \n","344":"A: == Lets get this straight ==\n\n\nB: I want to set this straight. '''I DO NOT CLAIM TO OWN THIS ARTICLE''' I DO however come in and make sure it remains clean up and within Wikipedia guidelines. This article has already been approved by wikipedia and Trains Wiki Project. This article has been written and flows easily for readers to understand and gather information. When new information is added. it is placed in the correct part of the article. If incorrect information is added, it is removed. I have no problem with people adding information, moving things around and what not. but to totally mess things up so they make no sense at all, and to add pointless information and remove useful information. that's not needed.  All the information in this article is up to date. This article is written in accordance with WP guidelines and editing tools. There is no need for a \"clean up\". this article received a B-class because it still lacks certain information. NOT because of the style it was written.  HeadMouse \n\nA: Just because an article has been graded by a Wikiproject doesn't mean there isn't always room for improvement. Wikipedia is not a static project, and none of the pages within it should be static items. Every day there'll be new users coming along with new things to add, or better ideas how to format something. So we shouldn't be reverting those changes simply on the basis that \"a wikiproject graded this version\". The article will continue to change and improve, and eventually the WP might re-grade it, but really what the WP grades it is irrelevent to the overall idea that we're here to make wikipedia better, not just to maintain wikipedia's status quo. \n\nB:  Now re read what I wrote. I have no problem with adding new information to bring the grade up (which is why this article got a B). But as I said, Trey is totally changing the article, making it harder for members to follow along and adding irrelevant information and removing useful information. Read the responses in my talk page. I am not the only member that thinks Trey is doing wrong. Read the history of the article you will see.  HeadMouse \n\nA: Regardless of an article's status with one or more WikiProjects, all articles must conform to Wikipedia's guidelines and official policies.  Judging by his edit summaries, ''TREYWiki'' feels the article does not meet either wiki_link or wiki_link.  Your insistence on reverting all edits made to the article back to your preferred version appears to be a clear violation of wiki_link. \n","345":"A: == \"Guest relations\" ==\n\n\nB: The correct capitalization for the section is \"Guest relations\", per the wiki_link.  If that section talked about the Guest Relations department at WDW, then both words would be correctly capitalized.  This is not the case, though, as the section is talking about how the monorail cast members relate to the guests at their attraction.  Guest Relations Cast Members would only involve themselves in the operation of the monorail to assist in emergencies, certainly not on a day-to-day basis.  I hope this helps.  \u27aa! \n\nA: '''Read the archives.''' The correct spelling of this title for Disney Company is with a capital R. It was agreed upon already to leave it caps. \n\nB: Can you show us where in the archives that was decided upon?  Because I tend to agree with HiDrNick's point.  It's not used as the department in this sense...it's used as a general term for relations with guests.  It's not \"The Walt Disney World Guest Relations Department\" which would require the capitalized R. \n\nA: Well, it can always be changed back to \"Rider Tips\" which makes better sense. \n\nB: Even though we told you 36 times that changing it to \"Rider Tips\" is inappropriate because this isn't a travel guide?  It should stay as Guest relations because this is about the general term...not about the specific department at Disney. \n\nA: To re-iterate what ''Metros'' said, the section cannot be called \"Rider Tips\" as that would violate Wikipedia's official policy on wiki_link.  Likewise, it cannot be titled \"Guest Relations\" because the wiki_link guideline states that only the first lettre of a heading is capitalized.  Additionally your claim of \"read the archives\" is disingenuous at best as you are the lone dissenter to consensus. \n\nB: If it can't be caps then it needs to be re titled. Rider Tips is more appropriate but no, this is not a travel agency, so the next best thing is Guest Relations. Since that is not working maybe it should be \"Helpful tips\" \n\nA: HeadMouse, refrain from any further violations of wiki_link.  You have been warned over and over again about this. \n\nB:  Yamla, learn how to be more understanding. Gees you could have simply fixed the mistake and THEN if I capt it again you could say I was in violation. but since it was a whole new title it was a simple mistake. see the comment above it's lower case \"t\" for tips. :::: WTF??? I am trying to find a way to correct your so-called problem. You don't want to capitalize a word that should be, and you don't want to use any other forms of titles. I mean damn. why don't you just remove the entire article. and again '''I DO NOT CLAIM TO OWN THIS ARTICLE,I DO NOT CLAIM TO OWN THIS ARTICLE,I DO NOT CLAIM TO OWN THIS ARTICLE,I DO NOT CLAIM TO OWN THIS ARTICLE.'''

Please also refrain from repeatedly adding obviously unwanted comments to another users page. If he removed them once, he has seen them. Thanks. \n\nA: It wasn't the same comment. \n\nB: It wasn't friendly or productive either. I would have been happy with external_link edit, but external_link was entirely unproductive, not to mention toothless. \n\nA: I'll stop posting on his page, however he'd been repeatedly warned.  Per wiki_link, I was warning him one last time before reporting him.  Please read the history of the wiki_link talk page and see what we were up against. I appreciate that you think you're defusing the situation, however I disagree that I'm an actor in this, just the reactor. \n","347":"A: ==Lee Rifle Prototype==\n\n\nB: I see that you disagree with my recently added information. I would respectfully disagree. I am not a rifle expert. I can see that you are. However, I think it is important for people to know where the Lee-Enfield Rifle came from in its history section. The article metions how the Lee-Enfield's design was influenced by the development of the earlier Lee-Metford. However, what influenced the development of the Lee-Metford and the Lee-Enfield? I suggest to you that it is the Lee Rifle Prototype made in Wallaceburg. Had it not been for this rifle and the Lee Brother's improvements to the box magazine in 1878 there would not have been a \"Lee-Enfield Rifle\". I believe that this information fits in with the Lee-Enfield article. However, if does not fit here what history section of what rifle would it fit into to? \n\nA: Thanks for the note.  You are incorrect.  The history of the Lee Enfield is separate and distinct from the Remington Lee and the Lee Meterford. One does not put a paragraph and pictures of the Colt M1911 on the Glock article, though one significantly influenced the other. You obviously disagree, so please start a discussion on the Lee Enfield page. \n\nB: I see you still disagree. I respect that you are \"sticking to your guns\". Nevertheless, I found the way you edited the page to be rather offensive. \"Please not again\". It was as if I was doing you a grand dis-service by adding more background information on the rifle. Your statement made it seem like you were a parent scolding a child for doing something wrong. In the future I would ask politely that you limit similar comments. I feel that my degree in history from a respected Canadian University has earned me that respect. Particularly when I make an edit regarding historical events. Your talk page shows that you have a history of offending people? Why do you feel the need to be cruel and condescending? You appear to have quite a bit of knowledge regarding rifles. Why not use that knowledge for good rather then evil? That aside I will agree and disagree with you on a couple of points. The rifles do have a distinct history of their own. That history, however, is connected. What service have you done to the page by substracting that information? All you have done is lead readers to potentially ask: Where did the Lee-Enfield Rifle come from? What other earlier influencers are their for the rifle? Where did James Paris Lee get his idea for the rifle's design? Did Lee create an earlier similar rifle? Did he create a rifle previous to the Lee-Enfield that was bolt-action, box magazine fed? Why not answer these questions on the site? Or more importantly what authority do you have to keep people from finding these answers on the Lee-Enfield page? When you suggested the rifle in the picture was a \"Colt M1911\" it made me question your expertise. The rifle in the picture is the Lee-Rifle prototype. \n\nA: Cut the crap.  I'm not saying not to add information, but you're misrepresenting what you are actually adding and you're picking a fight with me over it.  Start the Lee rifle article.  Start the Remington Lee article.  Start the Winchester Lee article.  If you've got something to add, add it in the proper place. Who the FUCK said the rifle in question was an M1911?  Reread what I said.  You think you have something to add, but it's really hard to take you serious when you can't recognize a clear analogy.  Look it up if you don't understand what that word is. \n","348":"A: == Articles on \"dysgenics\" ==\n\n\nB: Here are some articles on \"dysgenics\" from the past 10 years. \n\nA: I posted this same link not very long ago. You will observe that a significant number of these hits are related to a single book written by Richard Lynn. This is hardly evidence of any mainstream anthropological or socialogical thought on this subject, and there are few articles by geneticists. When we look at PubMed Central, where geneticists do actually publish, the overwhelming number of articles relate to research into fruit flies and mice. As such this article should concentrate on where the majority of the research is done. \n\nB: Perhaps you did post the same link but please note that my link is to Google Scholar, not just a regular Google search. \n\nA: Is the term 'dysgenics' really used for fruit flies and mice? I see only 'dysgenesis' being used in one paper. \n\nB: Jagz, my link was to google scholar as well, otherwise it would not have been of much use. Have you looked at the results for google scholar? They primarily relate to a very few publications. Yes Richard it is used, the term \"disgenic cross\" is used in the majority of the papers listed in PubMed central. \n\nA: So if the non-fruit-fly and non-mice information doesn't belong in this article and there is not sufficient space in the Eugenics article, where do you suggest that it go? \n\nB: Either remove it as wiki_link weight, or make a section for it in the wiki_link article, properly summarized first, of course. \n\nA: Thanks for weighing in Ramdrake, my question was directed at Alun though. ::::::::Ramdrake, I have added your suggestion for adding a section on dysgenics to the \"Fringe science\" article here: . \n","349":"A: == Bad article ==\n\n\nB: This has got to be one of the worst articles on Wikipedia. The article starts out as if it is going to be an article about dysgenics in a biological sense as discussed on the Talk page and then goes into an unbalanced, POV, and discontinuous discussion of dysgenics in a human population sense. \n\nA: That's because we haven't had time to finish revamping the article with proper dysgenic studies. I merely removed the most egregiously misleading content. \n\nB: The editors may not have had time to finish but they have had time to start. \n\nA: I don't see that you've done much to ''improve'' it. \n\nB: Do you really have a Ph.D.?

You were involved in an earlier discussion on whether to change the lede at Al Megrahi, so you should be aware of the policy-based reasons I have for opposing this change. The reasons presented so far in favor of the change have to do with whether there is enough evidence or whether there were was a jury trial or other issues which are outside of our roles here as editors.

Please enlighten me! \n\nB: Adding '(disputed)' to the phrase about him being a former Libyan intelligence officer is adding unsourced opinion.

While I totally agree with you, and have been wondering for some what one ''should'' say. To say e.g. 'See User:SimonTrew' to refer to 'my' user page seems ugly, and could lay wiki_link since discussions entries are signed ''at the end'', so it may not be immediately apparent I am referring to 'my' page. It is excaserbated that other things on the Wikipedia banner ''are'' listed as e.g. 'my talk page', 'my watchlist', ''my contributions, encouraging the idea that it would be 'my user page' (though of course that is simply listed with the user name, not 'my'). I can't see any way around this without excessive circumlocution, and in most cases it is simply a convenient fiction to call it 'my user page', and not controversial. I should appreciate your views. \n\nA: Ah, but it seems you missed the bit that qualified my statement. I said there was no such thing as \"my page\" ''in article space''. So it doesn't take much to interpolate that sentiment to \"my page\" in user space. '''''' \n\nB: Ah, perhaps that distinction was too subtle for me.

Name-calling and refusal to address the basic points shows antipathy toward consensus. Wikipedia should be neutral, which doesn't happen when refs are one-sided.

Also, see the definition of wiki_linking before accusing others of this term. (The one posting inflammatory messages and disrupting is pretty obvious, and I think anyone can see that.) \n\nA: What does it matter if members of the Black Dahlia Murder work with metalcore musicians, tour with metalcore musicians, or indeed like the music and are inspired by metalcore musicians? That does not mean that the music they play is metalcore. So Trevor likes Terror. So Terror excite him when he sees them. So what?

However, the USC has a sheet online of the logos they recognize as being official that can be used for products, articles, etc. We need to use the text ones because they are public domain. The usage of the Block C needs to be reduced in order to comply with the policies at wiki_link, especially requirement 1 (where if a free image can be created or found, the fair use image should not be used). \n\nA:  Sorry, but it says in plain English at the bottom of that online sheet, \"NOTE: The marks of The University of South Carolina are controlled under a licensing program administered by The Collegiate Licensing Company. Any use of these marks will require written approval from The Collegiate Licensing Company.\" Therefore, the text logos are no more \"free\" to use than the official Block C logo, and since the text logos appear on none of our school's uniforms or in any athletic facilities, the Block C is far more recognizable and appropriate as identifiers of the school's sports teams and should be used on all team articles. Reverting the articles in question to reflect this fact. \n\nB: *I'm sorry, but Zscout370 is correct. Under our policies, the wordmark logos are considered free of copyright (though not trademark), and must be used in lieu of non-free content when possible, per wiki_link #1. Please stop edit warring to restore the non-free logo. Also not that per USC, the wordmark logos are official athletic logos. Thank you, \n\nA: I'm sorry but neither of you are correct per the stated rule...\"Non-free content is used only where no free equivalent is available, or could be created, that would serve the same encyclopedic purpose.\" The encyclopedic purpose here is to identify a school's athletic team with the logo used by that team. The text logo is not and has never been used by the teams in question on the field or court (or by any television network during a broadcast), the Block C has been used for decades and is that common identifier for all USC athletic teams (except baseball), therefore the text logos do not serve the same purpose and cannot be considered an \"equivalent\". Please stop edit-warring to serve some need to Wikilawyer a common-sense issue into the ground. Also note that per USC, the wordmark logos are not to be used without written permission. Thank you. \n\nB: *It would appear that the University of South Carolina disagrees with you external_link. As per the trademark issues, it is a non-issue for us. Wikipedia is well aware of trademark issues. Please see wiki_link. A deeper understanding can be had by reading wiki_link and wiki_link. This is why we have  and , and why the wordmark logos are (rightfully) hosted on Commons, which only accepts free licensed works. \n\nA: You neatly avoided the issue of NFCC #1, which you raised. It makes no difference whether or not those text \"logos\" are \"official\", they are not used in any capacity on the uniforms or in the venues of the teams in question, and thus cannot serve as \"equivalent\" replacements for the logo that millions of people have been exposed to over decades and have come to recognize as THE identifier of the school's teams. The text logo might be used solely on the letterhead of the various team sports for all we know, but it certainly isn't used by the teams themselves, and thus doesn't serve the encyclopedic purpose of serving as an identifier for them. It's pretty disingenuous to suggest that any encyclopedia (other than one manipulated by a few people who simply enjoy being disruptive) would ever have an article about USC football, basketball, etc. without providing the primary logo used by those teams. But I guess that's why my professors laugh when anyone asks if using Wikipedia as a reliable source is acceptable, and thanks to people like the two I've dealt with here, I guess they'll always be laughing when students ask that question. Congrats on perpetuating the stereotype! \n\nB: *Actually, the issue of wiki_link #1 is central to the entirety of this debate. Are you an official representative designate of the University of South Carolina? If not, their official stance as expressed by their Division of Finance and Planning shown by the PDF linked above certainly stands as official, and yes it does matter a great deal. USC says the marks are official. They ARE the wordmarks of USC. Therefore, they qualify under NFCC #1. I'm not particularly interested in the opinions of students and professors of USC with regards to Wikipedia. I am interested in doing what I can to help maintain its wiki_link, which wiki_link devolves from. \n\nA: *And you've been reverted, yet again. \n\nB: And you've proved you have zero semblance of a life, yet again. \n","370":"A: == On Wikipedia ==\n\n\nB: Wikipedia must necessarily be constrained.

I definitely understand where you are coming from, using the power of Wikipedia for other things... but I'm afraid if we did that we'd lose focus about what we are here for.

If the only way to use it was to write it, what would be the point?

However it is my sincere hope that the Challenge Cup tournamets and finals will not be covered on separate articles as the creation of this template seems to suggest.

I thought that the foundation NSWRFL clubs already existed as rugby union clubs and simply broke away from the Union, much like clubs in the north of England like Wigan did. Wigan's foundation year is not 1895 (the year they broke away to form the RFL), it is many years before that when they were members of the already existing RFU. We have all the NSWRFL foundation clubs' histories starting from 1908, as though they suddenly sprung out of the ground then, with no mention of the pre-schism years. I might be wrong. Maybe a second Eastern Suburbs RL club existed alongside the first Eastern Suburbs RU club, but I just have a feeling the Australian situation mirrored the English one more closely and that this has been overlooked. \n\nA: My understanding is that they were new institutions with defected players. I only base this on my opinion and what I know about Cumberland. But I believe that Cumberland RL team was new club that run by different people but getting (pretty much) all of their players from Wests RU club. Other clubs I think were similar, but I can't be sure. The foundation year should be the year that they started, the year they became officially a group. But in todays context, if say a Central Coast team gets in the NRL, it isn't founded in say 2012, but they have been founded for a while now. Same with Gold Coast Titans, they came in to the competition in 2007, were officially let in to the competition in 2005, but they must have been working under a consortium for some time before that. History can span back before the foundation year. But most 1908 clubs, (I believe) were created that year, I don't think there was as much mucing around with todays new teams. But no doubt should history sections acknowledge the history of the area in sport, and defection. \n\nB: You'll see Jeff that for all of the wiki_link I use the combo-box to list both their RU and RL careers. You're right that Messenger's box fails to show his RU career. I'll fix that. Regarding this thread, notwithstanding that many of the RU clubs such as South Sydney and Newtown shut down after the defections (mostly after the 2nd wave post 09) the new RL clubs of the same district were distinct entities. I can't imagine the RU purists at any club giving RL a leg-up by handing over their club. I expect wiki_link's body of work will give clarity on this.- \n\nA: Yeah I have noticed that you use that crappy old rugby infobox with DCIs. I've often wondered why. \n","380":"A: == Golan mountain mediation ==\n\n\nB: I'm thinking about requesting an official medcom mediation for the Golan mountain names. If I start one, would you be interested in participating? \n\nA: If you start the process I will certainly consider it. I have quite a busy schedule for the next little while so I can't commit. I also don't think this is an appropriate situation for official mediation, because it's simply a matter of a proposal not reaching consensus. But like I said, if you start it, I'll think about joining. \n\nB: Hi Breein,  opened this case at the mediation cabal and I have accepted it, could you confirm you are still willing to take part in mediation? \n\nA: Forgive me for not knowing exactly how the process works, but can you please briefly explain what the commitment is? I don't have lots of spare time these days. Also, I feel like both Supreme Deliciousness and myself have spelled out our respective feelings about the issue very clearly on the talk page, and other users did not support his requested change with consensus. Anyway, if I join mediation, what exactly will happen? Will I just be expected to rehash my arguments from the talk page? \n\nB: Breein1007, there was more support and sources for the standardized (arabic) than for hebrew, and based on that, I could change the names now. But I want to settle this in a better way, so this is a chance for you. \n\nA: Please stop harassing me Supreme Deliciousness... there was not more support or sources for the Arabic names than for the English names (which originated from Hebrew). We have been over this before. I don't appreciate you following me around and pestering me by repeating your unsubstantiated claims ad infinitum. If you do make the changes right now, I will revert them because you don't have consensus for the suggestion. \n\nB: Supreme Deliciousness, please do not continue with these unconstructive interventions if you wish to proceed with mediation, Brein mediation is a process whereby we talk through the issues in a structured conversation and try and produce a solution that is acceptable to both parties and that benefits the encyclopedia, it is a voluntary process and requires a willingness to compromise to build towards consensus. There is no time commitment beyond what you can manage.    (my apologies was not logged in when making comment) \n\nA: Let me start by thanking you Ajbpearce for your effort in this case. Basically, what happened here on my talk page has convinced me that it would be a mistake on my part to participate in mediation for this matter. There were a number of people who were involved in the discussion, and after discussion and sources from several people, there was no clear consensus to make the suggested change. Some sources that were found showed Arabic names used on English maps, while some sources found showed the status quo English names that originated from Hebrew used. In all honesty, I don't have much else to contribute to the discussion, so I don't see what good mediation would do. I would simply be rehashing points that I have already clearly made on the talk page, and that some editors seem to be ignoring as they repeat ad infinitum their demands that their sources trump mine and there is clear consensus for the change (which there is not). I really am busy these days, and I feel that mediation would draw me into long, frankly pointless, circular debates about the issue. I can't let this issue hurt the more important things in my life right now, so as I said, I have to decline. \n","381":"A: == Bogus warning messages ==\n\n\nB: There appears to be little I can do to stop you from POV-pushing on wiki_link and elsewhere, but please refrain from putting bogus warning templates on my talk page.  You are about as likely to block me as to sprout wings and fly. \n\nA: The warnings are not bogus. I'm not an admin; I clearly can't block you. But if you continue being disruptive in your edits by removing sourced information and edit warring against consensus, I will not hesitate to submit a formal complaint so that an admin who CAN block you will review your edits and act appropriately. You incorrectly assume that only admins can give out warnings. \n\nB: Please do (file a formal complaint).  I would look forward to additional administrative scrutiny of your edits. \n\nA: Enjoy your ban, loser. \n","382":"A: == Brad's question ==\n\n\nB: In case you hadn't noticed with all the drama, Brad asked if you would make an undertaking external_link. \n\nA: I replied above, the answer is yes of course :::Well could you let him know i accept please? the motion 3 thing thanks \n\nB: It appears that Roger Davies has posted 3 motions at that request; the last of which specifically mentions you. \n\nA: , but note that this has not yet received arb votes; they may support it, they may oppose it or they may amend it in the meantime. \n\nB: Thanks mate that`s very kind of you o) \n","383":"A: ==Off2riorob==\n\n\nB: With respect to external_link, you may have missed the context that the precipitating action was an edit war involving Off2riorob's repeated insertion of dodgy material at wiki_link, for which he has now received a very strong warning under the climate change discretionary sanctions. . To fully observe your \"Remedy 3\" topic ban it would be wise to step away immediately. I will remove your comment. \n\nA: You will do no such thing. I am commenting on a proposed sanction on an editor. I am not commenting on a CC article at all, thank you \n\nB:  I'll take it to wiki_link and see what the view is on this. \n\nA: Please do, until such a time as clarification is given i expect you to unstrike my comments \n\nB: This is your formal notification . \n\nA: Are you taking the piss? You file an enforcement request against me instead of just asking for clarification? Words fail me. \n","384":"A: == Future fights in fight records ==\n\n\nB: Please do not add future fights to a fighter's fight history table.  As per a more than two-year old consensus at the wiki_link to follow wiki_link that fights should only be added to the table after the fight has occurred.  If you have arguments against this consensus to follow Wikipedia policy you are welcome to discuss it at the Wikiproject.  Thanks. \n\nA: Negative. What two year old consensus? This has not been enforced in the past two year years. If you want to change the rules of how these pages operate, please start a new discussion and invite the editors that actively edit these pages to the party. This isn't going to stick without a clear and transparent process involving all of the relevant stakeholders (i.e editors). Making up a new rule (using an old and outdated never enforced \"consensus\" of editors) is no way to go about making drastic changes to articles. \n\nB: As I said, you are welcome to go to the wiki_link where this discussion was held a week or two ago.  The question was raised about adding future fights to the fight history table, I mentioned there was a consensus against it two years ago.  No one offered any other input so the consensus appeared to stand.  If you have argument against it, again, go to the WikiProject where there is a recent discussion on this issue you can participate in. \n\nA: You mean the discussion that had new posts on it two days ago, the one where two other users offered dissenting viewpoints. So with me in the mix, it's three for and three against. Great attempt at consensus there. \n\nB: We can continue the discussion on the WikiProject's talk page.  I've already responded to your comments there. \n\nA: Sure, that's why I posted over there. \n","385":"A: i've explained this in both edit summaries  and on the articles talk page, (over and over again.

Really? I've been waiting for you to actually start talking instead of reverting every single edit to YOUR? page. It's not YOUR page. If you were an editor that actually talked things out we wouldn't be in this situation. YOU are the one that obviously likes edit wars. If you just remove the non-Mexican boxers from the list, it would all be settled. Instead, you just revert without discussion. Big man with the insults and the threats. \n\nB: Even though non-Mexican boxers on the list weren't born in Mexico they are still considered Mexican and are highly proud to be by their ring entrance music, wardrobe, etc. I noted on the bottom of the list which boxers are indicated Mexican by the commission due to parent's nationality, residence or other circumstances. you clearly have an anger towards the success in boxing of the mexicans race which is you dont like seeing so many, many champions on 1 page. FYI i dont like edit wars like you do, i think its a waste of time unless you are passionate and defensive of something which is why i am doing this, on the other hand i think you're here only cause of some kind of hate or envy you have so much otherwise you wouldnt be here so much. \n\nA: I had such high hopes with your first sentence. However, if you cant write a single thing on my page that isn't full of insults, threats, accusations of racism, etc. This conversation is over. Please try again when you have a more mature attitude. I am very sorry that you have to live vicariously through others. \n\nB: Happy Now, i just got rid of the non mexicans so you cant argue you over nothing. you'll now have to find something better to do.

The ''wiki_link'' said one hour ago, \"The link between Mr. Abdulmuttalab and Yemeni extremists is still tenuous.\" and \"It is still unclear if his claimed links with Al Qaeda-affiliated extremists in the country are genuine.\" and \"But the possible link further stoked concerns about terrorism in Yemen.\" When I woke up this morning, this article had been tranformed into speculation. I am thinking about sending this article to request for comments because I am unable to stay up 24 hours a day for a week. Comments? - \n\nA: The article is one of the most visible articles now, so no need to request the attention of more eyes. \"because I am unable to stay up 24 hours a day for a week.\" you may have a legitimate concern but this sounds like wiki_link. \n\nB: Yes I know I do not wiki_link. Good thinking, I will skip request for comments for the moment. But it is alarming. Thank you for your reply. - \n\nA: There's been some concern about POV-pushing here, and I think that SusanLesch is just trying to say that there is indeed some speculation in the article, which I agree about. However, I don't think that it's serious enough to bother provoking another argument as before, because it ends up being a matter of source interpretation. Now, if it gets to the point of blatant misinformation, I'd remove that immediately. \n\nB: I likewise am concerned by edits such as external_link right now, in which pertinent information to the effect that the suspect told his parents he intended to remain in Yemen was deleted. \n\nA: Epeefleche, that paragraph says \"Yemen\" three times, with the word ending three of four sentences. I tried to reduce that repetition. - \n\nB: If by doing so you delete pertinent information from the article, as you did here, it is inappropriate.  We say \"suspect\" and the suspect's name many times in the article, but you wouldn't go through the article deleting whole clauses that mention himand are not in themselves repetitiouson that basis. \n\nA: Tried again. I don't like your terminology saying that \"is inappropriate\". - \n","387":"A: == University ==\n\n\nB: Hi. Every source said that Abdulmutallab attended wiki_link until last night when the ''wiki_link'' said external_link that his degree is from wiki_link. Maybe they will correct that. - \n\nA: Yes, wiki_link, came to America on rice? \n\nB: Huik01 spammed my talk page. - \n\nA: Ohh and Susan I fucked your mother like a goat. \n","388":"A: == Acceptable quoting ==\n\n\nB: has been adding quotations from a ''National Geographic'' piece to species articles (such as wiki_link, wiki_link, and wiki_link), that I and  (see  think are likely copyright violations, and should not be included for this reason and since they are bad style. These quotations are general statements about animal sleep, quoted as full sentences, without any comment identifying the nature of the comment or much discussion of the subject in general, so the issue isn't the length per se, but that they aren't used properly. They also don't convey much in my opinion, and are from a sort of news news piece, not statements by a biologist or anything like that. I'm not sure this a good place to post, since my concerns are that this could be an unacceptable use of non-free text, and bad style, with which John Hill disagrees with, but I can't find a very good place to post this. \u2014 \n\nA: If the original NG author is not inserting their opinion, belief, theory, or the like, then such statements can ''always'' be paraphrased to provide the same factual data, retaining the reference to the source of that information.  As such, that is frivolous quoting that is happening there.  As you state, the only time we should be direct quoting an author is to insert personal statements that cannot be easily paraphrased any other way. - \n\nB: I'm having trouble finding diffs easily (some of the edits in question are a month old), but if they're anything like external_link it's a misuse of a quotation.  Whether or not it's a copyright infringement, it's just plain wrong as a matter of style and can and should be paraphrased.  '''''' ('''') \n","389":"A: == Use of movie-still when discussing actress ==\n\n\nB: Outside input requested on  vs . \n\nA: *Totally superfluous to the article. The article related that the movie was important in her career. Her visual appearance in the movie is not discussed, and certainly not by anything relying on secondary sources. I.e., the image is purely eye candy, decorative. It's unnecessary to an understand of the article subject, and needs to be removed. The rationale is well constructed, I'll grant that, but the mere presence of a rationale does not make it a valid rationale. *By the way, wiki_link fails as well. It's being used decoratively. A question that can be asked in cases like this is whether any still image from the movie could serve the same purpose. If so, it almost certainly fails wiki_link #8. This is the case for both of these images. Neither still is iconic. Neither still is discussed, supported by secondary sources. \n\nB: ** *Cough* wiki_link *cough* featured article *cough* \n\nA: *** I hate it when crap like this gets through FA. So many times I see FA paying lip service to NFCC. \n","390":"A: == Austro Hungarian GT ==\n\n\nB: As this is not so far away, I'd like to ask you if, after Tegetthoff and her class, we can start Franz Ferdinand and Zrinyi's noms. Also, to have this boy at FT status, we are going to have to have all of the Radetzkys, Tegetthoffs and the Ersatz Monarch class become FA's, as it has been shown that hte Habsburgs are too short, and I believe the Karl's are also in that predicment. \n\nA: I'll do some number crunching now to see what we need to get to an FT. I think that first thing's first, we need to get the Tegetthoff, the class article and the Erzherzog's to GA status. Then we work on the FAC's. \n\nB: Well ok. I'll try and find somthing on the Karl's tomorrow. \n\nA: I'm going to nominate the class article on the Karl's soon. I just need a bit more for the Service history section and find info for or replace the line drawing of the class in the characteristics section. \n\nB: That's all nice and dandy. Do you think sEvastopol could take a GA? \n\nA: Possibly. It needs a bit of work but yes. However We need to finish the AH BB's before we go off to other side projects. \n\nB: I know. Do you think Tegetthoff is done? I've turned around to trying to expand the Karl's \n\nA: The class or the ship itself? \n\nB: The ship. It seems that all of the points have been adressed. \n\nA: Yes, I just need the reviewer to reply. \n","391":"A: == Where you at ==\n\n\nB: I came by looking for your explanation on J Milburn's talk.

I'm not sure what more you want me to say. Am I not speaking English here or are you simply having a case of selective hearing or worse is beyond me.... \n\nA: Since you are using the term drive by and I am not understanding its relevance, can you explain your understanding of my role in the Cato June VP promotion and what would have happened without me playing this role. \/\/\/wiki_link\/wiki_link) \n\nB: No...I cannot and I will not. Stop \"acting stupid\" and get this through your thick head that only cares for a '''Pixelated trophy''' rather than for true content improvement; You do not deserved to claim credit for these FPs and VPs. You never uploaded the images or taken them yourself. You merely nominated them and sent some e-mails to people who did the needed work. Had you re-stitched them, then you could legitimately claim the points but you did not. Knock it off Tony. Stop being a greedy, trophy collecting, paranoid, \"sandbagger\" and start to actually do your fair share of work before you claim credit for it. I'm done replying to you. I'm not a judge and like you external_link, I should not \"rule on other competitors points\". Please give it a rest man..... \n","392":"A: == Suggestion.... ==\n\n\nB: Can you tone external_link down a bit? I agree that OM misinterpreted the page, but unless it happens regularly, it's really no sign of anything but a bad moment. \n\nA: I'm pretty sure past experience suggests otherwise, but I can try. - \n\nB: Thanks! \n","393":"A: == Personal attacks ==\n\n\nB: It goes without saying that calling me a  is an unacceptable wiki_link.  If you'd like to contribute to the discussion, at least try to pretend that you are an adult.  Further  from you will not be tolerated. \n\nA: Iz wonderz whatz futherz external_link willz resultz inz. - \n\nB: You're  with the typical results.  Consider this a final warning. \n\nA: Put up or shut up. - \n","394":"A: == Series template being misused ==\n\n\nB: Where there are a series of articles on a subject, it's appropriate for them to be linked by a series navbox.  But this template has been added to every article in a category. That's inappropriate - the category itself links all the articles.  Each article is likely also to have internal links to relevant articles such as wiki_link, and it's just not necessary, or appropriate, for them all to show the series navbox template, with a confusing image.  (He may be instantly recognisable to some, but only, I suggest, a small minority of WP readers).  I suggest that the template should not be added to articles other than those which are listed within it: as I understand it, that's the normal way templates like this are used. \n\nA: I totally agree with PamD. The template should only be placed when necessary. For example: the template was unappropriate on wiki_link, and so I removed it and replaced with a link to wiki_link, which the latter page has the template and seems appropriate. Where the template needs to be removed, it should, if it is not already, replace with the appropriate link. \n\nB: Look closely. The word 'series' in the template, links to the -category- on Catholic sex abuse. Because of the sad circumstance of abuse that went on there, there's a case for the article on that school to befit that category and therefore also membership in the series, the nine most prominent articles of which are shown on the template's face. There is more than one view as to what you've deigned 'appropriate'. \n\nA: Disagree with ResignBen16; agree with previous two users. This template does not belong on articles. It should be a see-also or See Main link. \n","395":"A: ==Consensus?==\n\n\nB: Do we have consensus that, in its present form, this means of linking is inappropriate across the relevant articles? **I am not aware that it is being removed from ''all'' articles.  If that was the case the debate would centre on its ''deletion'' rather than targeted ''removal''. (It currently links to over 100 articles, if I am not mistaken). However, there are already navboxes that may be more comprehensive and also less intrusive for these and which would better aid navigation to related articles. ***Well, you removed it from wiki_link, where it was clearly most apros. \n\nA: Clearly no. We're far from that. A number of claims have been put and singularly refuted putting us back at the originating status quo prior to the first talk comment. A case by case examination on each individual article, initiated at the talkpages thereof will address what you raise; not unnuanced or across-the-board general characterisation. It's never that peremptory, i'm sorry. \n\nB: * Well, I'd certainly support the claim that the current form doesn't work, as outline above. I'm happy to have a navbox along these lines, but the format would need to change. - \n\nA: Let folks get back from Easter to pass comment. Give it a week and then some. Ask yourself too, were you aware of the series before this template's raising it to attention? \n\nB: If your intent is providing original research, that is all the more reason for questioning the indiscriminate application of this template. How many links do you envisage for inclusion? It is evident that from the contested 'terms of reference', potential size alone at the very least indicates the necessity for a collapsible format. \n\nA: From where'd you get those words 'original research' just put in my mouth by you? You'd better explain what the novel thesis is I'm promoting by displaying an article series with a template or retract it and your implication. Make that shit fly or eat it back up. \n","396":"A: == Potential candidates ==\n\n\nB: There is nothing encyclopedic or long term about the claims of the press that jonny is a potential candidate, the whole comment requires removing and not renaming. Worthless speculation would be as good a header. Removal is the correct thing to do. \n\nA: Once again, it is not speculation. Speculation is a guess. McDonnell has said he intends to run. How is repeating that even close? - \n\nB: Its weakly claimed and not widely reported. An editor on the times claimed that him and him and her might run and that in his opinion him and her would have a lot of support. \n\nA: It is not weakly supported, and that is not what the Deputy Political Editor of the ''Times'' says; she says he has announced his intention to stand. In any event, here's another reliable source: external_link (\"So far the list of confirmed contenders includes the Miliband brothers and John McDonnell, a veteran leftwinger.\"). The lack of wide reporting may have more to do with the fact that he is not well known and that the Sibling Rivalry is a much more compelling story. - \n\nB: I don't care about this issue at all, I am only interested that we report it correctly. I can't see that article but I do know that when a contender announces his intention to stand there will be massive coverage by the press and the the news whoever he is, it is simply not true to assert this McDonald person is a nominee, this is a false claim and weakly cited and should not be asserted as if a fact. \n\nA: First, no one is a nominee because no one has filed nomination papers. The NEC hasn't even agreed the timetable for the election yet. The Milibands have announced they will stand, and so has McDonnell. The latter fact is established by not one, but two, major UK news sources with very good international reputations. How is that \"weakly cited\"? It is simply bizarre that you claim it is a \"false claim\" when two such reliable sources make it. Why do you assume you know better? In the end, it appears you are denying reality because you think there will be a media frenzy when any candidate says he or she will run. That is simply not true. Minor candidates don't get that sort of attention. - \n\nB: Each and every nomination will receive large press coverage, your man has had no coverage because he has not nominated. You claim is very weak and that is the reason you removed it. \n\nA: Again, no one has been nominated because the NEC has not even started the process yet. If only nominated candidates are to be listed, I'll take down the Milibands too. You don't know what you are talking about. We shouldn't disregard the ''Times'' and ''Financial Times'' because you think there will be a hoopla for each candidate who announces. I took down McDonnell out of respect for you because I wanted to give you a chance to better explain your opposition. If your opposition is confined to the fact that you believe in minor politicians who announce will get huge coverage and therefore its absence means he must not be a candidate, then there is really no reason not to put him back up. Do you have a better reason? - \n\nB: Are you still claiming he is a candidate? PleasE, your claim is not being reported, not even thinly never mind widely. \n\nA: I'm not claiming it, two reputable news sources are reporting it, so of course it should be included. It is absurd to propose that we should not believe press accounts unless the entire political media get excited about it. He is a minor figure; his failure in 1997 is rarely remembered. That does not mean we should not include him as a candidate. - \n","397":"A: == according to the times ==\n\n\nB: I have removed this as it is worthless speculation, according to the press.  In addition, the ''Times'' is reporting that wiki_link will announce his candidacy during the week of 16 May; that wiki_link intends to announce he is standing; and that wiki_link and wiki_link, the former wiki_link, are considering joining the race. \n\nA: You are clearly fuzzy on the difference between speculation and assertion. The statement is an affirmative statement supported by a reliable source. Saying that Burnham and Cruddas \"might\" run is speculation; saying they are \"considering\" runs is an assertion of fact. That the other two are assertions and not speculation is so obvious that I really hope I don't have to explain it to you. - \n\nB: I am fuzzy, but I appreciate you removing your inserted falsehood from the article. \n\nA: There was no falsehood, so why don't you dial it back a bit? The only other editor who's commented agreed with me, and you have still not bothered to properly explain yourself in the section above. As you should have gleaned from my edit summary, the change is not a permanent change of stance. I am giving you a chance to explain your problem with the article, which you have somehow fail to do so far. If you can't there will be no reason not to put McConnell back up. Your reaction from the start has been totally disproportionate. - \n\nB: Are you joking? Mcdonnel has not announced, well he is not being reported in the press as having announced.  but him back if you insist but it is not being reported. It looks false to me. wiki_link \n\nA: Are you joking, the ''Times'', the bloody ''Times'', says he \"announced his intention to stand\". I will ask for the umpteenth time. What is wrong with the ''times''? - ::Whether you believe it or not, I respect you quite a bit as an editor. As a result, I want you to explain what your problem is with the ''Times'' source. I recognize that no one else is carrying the same report, so I'm willing to hold off, but I really want you to explain what your problem with the ''Times'' or this particular article is. - \n\nB: Add your claim again then, I object and dispute it :I am not here to waste my time talking absolute opinionated crap \n","398":"A: == How to railroad an editor ==\n\n\nB: It looks like there are some editors out on a railroading venture.  Unfortunately for them, the SPI didn't go as planned.  The train wreck at SPI did not however stop the attacks. In a nutshell, my outside view noted: A request for CU to prove you were a sockpuppet.  Checkuser determined that by IP, Location, and presumably other unmentioned technical means (of which they do have), that there was no match between your location and the computer(s) you use, and the location and computer(s) that COM uses. A Wikistalk report that looked damning at first, until put in perspective:  The accuser had more overlap with COM than you. Indisputable evidence that you must be COM because you won't outright deny it...which you now clearly have.. The bottom line is that once you were focused on, despite the fact that the allegations were countered with facts, you were still railroaded. I'm not sure that your account can be salvaged. I apologize for what you have been put through here at Wikipedia. Your views were not welcome here by several editors, and come hell or high water they will railroad you out of town. \n\nA: Thank you for the comment of support. I restored it after Rd232 removed it (and blocked the editor who posted it). This is definitely a trying situation. The most disillusioning and distressing aspect is that dozens of articles I spent months working on have been deleted. That's pretty hurtful and seems awfully mean spirited. Anyway, it's nice to see that there are those who've taken the time to look into the situation and to offer some support and encouragement. Take care. \n\nB: I'm sure it is distressing, no-one doubts that. And most of the articles deleted needn't really have been; I did remove a couple of deletion tags from ones I saw tagged which seemed worth keeping. If you're willing to come clean as to who you were before, I'll make the effort to look through the deleted list and restore ones that look useful. \n\nA: Freakshownerd might have gotten a more sympathetic and supporting audience if s\/he hadn't consistently insisted his\/her interpretation of BLP was incorrect, used inappropriate unblock requests, edit warring consistently, failing to engage substantively with the complaints of other editors, and showed much evidence of being unwilling to entertain the notion that s\/he was wrong, in principle, in reality or even in potential.  The community finds it easier to block someone who is being a wiki_link; there were lots of opportunity for improvement and none were taken despite consistent requests, instructions and comments - I made it clear I was willing to discuss edits and took those edits I found had merit to heart but there were still rounds of edit wars on William Dembski, Peter Duesberg, poppers and more.  Even if the block is incorrect (FSN is not a sockpuppet of COM) the wiki_link overall didn't help and unless changed would probably result in a block anyway.

But here was the start of our discussion  which, despite my polite request, quickly devolved into assumptions of bad faith on your part and extraordinary rudeness by you based on your misguided assumptions. Unless I am mistaken it ended with you requesting I not post on your talkpage. Unlike the worms and trolls emerging here on my page, I had no problem complying. I don't like hanging around creeps. I did post once when I saw you closed an AfD as delete when they only comments were in favor of keeping, but then I remembered who you were and removed my comment. Another editor took your inappropriate action to DRV where it was overturned. So again, yes, you are rude, yes, you are involved, yes you are a bad admin, yes you are a consistenet policy violator, yes you are a hypocrite who asks an editor to steer clear but has no problem going after that same editor at your first opportunity, but nevermind. That kind of abusive stupidity and harassment seems to be quite common here. Still waiting on those diffs. I guess you can't be bothered.

The demographics sections\/articles need more on them than just ethnicity; Canadian demographic sections in particular don't have a lot of economic or age-spectrum information, which American and UK ones do, so there's lots more \"enormous\" lists of such data yet needed. \n\nA: Your table addition was inappropriate and way too big and broad for a city's article.

Besides, Final Fantasy X-2 did not use \"The Barkeep\" in both line AND text. \n\nB: It just is awkward to refer to him as \"Owner\" when he is \"the Owner (of the Den-Liner)\". Stop referring to him as \"Owner\" and stop removing my use of the definite particle before his name.\u2014 \n\nA: I beg to differ. If it was awkward, I would had used \"the Owner\" awhile ago. But it is treated as a name and should be left as it is, though I did use \"The Owner of the DenLiner\" to meet you half way. \n\nB: Stop being so fucking stubborn. This is how we treat the name on the English Wikipedia. It does nothing wrong to call him \"the Owner\" when saying \"Owner\" looks awkward. You are not one to talk on what does not look awkward, considering you have a history of providing awkward phrasing and improper grammar in articles.\u2014 \n","404":"A: ==[WIKI_LINK: Wikipedia:Requests for mediation]==\n\n\nB: Have the major contributors here considered asking for mediation. I am not a mediator, but will be willing to work with you more if we have a formal request submitted. However, my understanding is that mediation requests take some time to get a mediator assigned to the case. Just a thought. \n\nA: I'm happy to invite others to mediate this article; in fact, both Ron and I have informally asked you to do so.  Does the process need to be formal for any reason?  Ron is making pretty blanket claims about the article being \"unsalvageable\" and so far refuses to provide specific examples or evidence.  I'm confident that once the evidence is provided we can address whatever problems exist; outside input would definitely be helpful. \n\nB: I see that it could be, like forever, before a mediator is assigned due to a lack of mediators. I am always happy to help and am currently reviewing RonCrams rewrite to see what the major differences are. \n\nA: Thanks - it might help (if you want more to read, lol) to look at the external_link I made against an earlier version of Ron's rewrite, which I find extremely POV and inaccurate in many places. \n\nB: Okay...I'll check the references and see what I think should and shouldn't be in the article...maybe there can be some way to make everyone happy. \n\nA: Gentlemen, it really makes no sense to say I have \"refused to provide specific examples or evidence.\"  I have said repeatedly that the article treats one viewpoint as fact. That is the very definition of POV.  The article does not discuss the other viewpoints on this controversial subject, nor does it say who holds these viewpoints or why. My rewrite  clarifies these essential points, yet Sloat has reverted the rewrite and been intransigent in any effort to make the article meet wikipedia standards. \n\nB: You have repeated that, it is true, but you have not provided specific examples or evidence of where you believe that to be the case.  That is why it makes sense to say that.  I have not been intransigent - I have gotten frustrated, it is true, but as others here can attest, when a specific issue was named (e.g. the sentence about the various intel investigations into the issue), I worked with others to improve the sentence.  The problem, Ron, is that you have so far refused to even name a particular sentence that you think has POV problems.  Simply saying the whole thing - that has been developed over years by multiple editors from various political perspectives - should be replaced with a version that a single editor (with a single, highly charged POV) has worked on for about a month is what makes no sense. \n\nA: Sloat, I am mostly talking about what the article does not say.  How can I give specific examples of that?  You are making a ridiculous request.  The article does not discuss the other viewpoints, say who holds them or why.  I cannot give you an example because the example does not exist.  I repeat what I said before - the article is POV.  I have made changes to the rewrite based on CSTAR's comments, but you will not.  Your intransigence is this regard is ridiculous.  It is my goal that we make this article into a featured article.  I am not insisting that I be the only editor of the article.  That is another ridiculous comment.  I am pointing out that my rewrite provides the best format necessary for an NPOV article.  In the Intro, it introduces the various views and the two key questions that each view needs to answer.  The body of the article discusses the evidence supporting each view.  And finally, there is a short discussion of the evidence that has been published about Saddam's possible involvement in the attacks of 9\/11.  An outline of this kind is the only way to produce an NPOV article. \n\nB: Please cut out the BS about my \"intransigence.\"  It is an unwarranted personal attack.  You say my request is \"ridiculous\" because you are talking about \"what the article does not say.\"  So I suppose we're agreed that what it '''does''' say currently has no POV problems; that is excellent and I am glad we can remove the tag now.  As for what it does not say, can you give specific examples of what is missing here?  That would be a good start.  Otherwise, you are just repeating yourself without specifics once again.  You are asking me to make changes to the rewrite, but there is no point in that, since we don't have any problems with the current article.  Believe me, if I get started on changing the rewrite, we have a long uphill battle ahead, as I have specific objections to nearly every sentence of it.  I have listed nine problems above with it, which you refuse to engage.  But, again, the rewrite is not necessary as we have no POV problems in the current version.  If there is something missing, let's add it!  But your mere assertion that your version is \"the only way to produce a NPOV article\" is not helpful. \n\nA: Okay, now maybe this page will load a little quicker since I have archived 300 kb's of talk...sorry but this had to be done...I mean this talk page is still over 100kb's too big I'm going to look over some things tomorrow and then try to help get this article more agreeable to all involved. \n\nB: Sloat, I have given specific examples.  My rewrite is full of specific examples of what the current article does not say.  But most important is the structure of the article itself, the outline.  The article has to introduce all of the different views and how they differ on the key points.  Then the body of the article has to give the evidence to support each view. How many times have I repeated this and yet you continue to ask me the same question again and again?!!!  The current article is completely POV.  Making articles NPOV is non-negotiable.  Despite your comments to the above, I did respond to your \"nine problems.\"  My version is not the final article, but it is the only way to begin an NPOV article.  An article cannot present a viewpoint as fact, as the current does.  As I said before, that is the very definition of POV.  You have never made any effort to defend the POV nature of the article. \n\nA: How about putting specific examples here of what the article does not say so that we can distinguish them from the things that are also in your rewrite that are already in the article?  You keep asserting the article is completely POV but you have not yet offered a single example of a POV statement or sentence in the article.  Where does it \"present a viewpoint as fact\"?  It does not.  It states what the consensus of experts concludes.  You say you responded to the nine problems but you quickly dropped the debate when I replied to your responses, so the fact is, my arguments against your rewrite have ultimately not been refuted.  But again, there is no need for the rewrite since the consensus version of this article is fine as it is. \n","405":"A: == SSCI additions? ==\n\n\nB: How much do we need on the SSCI on this page?  It is the biggest section on the page.  We already have a page devoted to the report where all the conclusions are, and they are also all on the timeline.  I suggest going back to a shorter summary of the conclusions that are relevant here, with links to the main page, rather than lots of duplicate information. \n\nA: all the material in the SSCI section is relevant here and can't be found in such detail anywhere else in wikipedia.  i don't think the section is too long.  i removed duplicate info from the timeline. \n\nB: So shouldn't the 9\/11 Commission section be longer?  Why not just reprint both entire reports on Wikipedia?  I'm being facetious because I think having the SSCI section as the longest section in the article is a little absurd.  And if it is going to be this long we should at least mention the as-yet-unreleased volume ii of the report, specifically the sections dealing with how Iraqi defectors manipulated American intelligence specifically on this issue, which is far more relevant than much of what you included.  I also think you have biased the summary in a subtle way by burying the main relevant conclusion  that the Intelligence community was justified in its conclusion that there was no evidence of Saddam-AQ conspiracy.  You have also included totally irrelevant information like Saddam's ties to secular Palestinian groups.  Another clear bias is the inclusion of conclusion 103 without any indication that the information from al-Libi has since been totally discredited.  I don't think that needs to be here, but there should be a separate section on Powell's speech, I think, that includes this information.  It all leaves the reader with a very inaccurate impression. ::I see you are way ahead of me on the Powell speech.  I have included the npov tag on the ssci section until the above is resolved.  The powell speech needs to include information about the fact that the CIA and DIA have acknowledged that all those points have been totally discredited.  I'm adding a tag there too. \n\nA: Sloat, if you want your tags to have any credibility, you need to provide some links that support your point. So far, I have no idea what you are talking about. \n\nB: i have no idea what you are talking about either.  i included everything in the 9\/11 report having to do with saddam\/al qaeda links.  and the fact that it's now considered POV to directly quote the SSCI report is absurd to the point of being just plain silly.  as for the powell speech, where has the CIA and DIA \"acknowledged that all those points have been totally discredited.\"  and don't simply say \"it's in the timeline\", give links. ::::and as for the \"as-yet-unreleased volume ii of the report\", you want me to quote a report that hasn't been released yet?? \n\nA: It's not necessarily to quote it so extensively.  It is pov to bury the main conclusion related to the issue while framing it as if they concluded otherwise.  I don't expect you to quote volume 2 but if we're going to be this comprehensive it is a pretty glaring omission to exclude what is known about it.  As for Powell, if you don't know what I'm talking about, you haven't been paying attention to anything I've written over the past several months.  This is getting frustrating and I don't know if it's because you guys really don't understand any of this or because you are being intentionally obtuse. \n\nB: what is known about it??  as for being pov \"to bury the main conclusions\", i haven't buried anything.  the conclusions are there, as well as everything else the committe found.  what's frustrating is you don't quote sources.  it's like pulling teeth trying to get you to quote a source. \n\nA: You're full of shit.  I quote sources when necessary, but I don't re-quote sources every time you or Ron decides to make an argument that I refuted months ago.  Read the timeline yourself, my sources are all in there and I have spent a couple years researching them by now.  As for volume ii, why not external_link for starters?  It's ridiculous that you guys put known disinformation in over and over and then demand that I research the sources to refute it when you know goddamn well they exist.  I have been over Powell's speech extensively and refuted every point.  Powell himself no longer supports the conclusions there and the Bush Admin has backed off of them.  The al-Libi stuff is in every mainstream newspaper that has touched the issue, yet you delete it from the timeline and you pretend it doesn't exist on the main page.  Ron at least has the courage to say that he believes al-Libi was corroborated by another terrorist, but he is so wrong about that that it's laughable.  And, no, I don't feel like quoting the sources again on that point; you can find them yourself by reading where I quoted them the last time, above on this very page!! \n","406":"A: == Thanks ==\n\n\nB: Thanks for the quick response to my block request.

There is no more reason to categorise these as \"plays\" than there is for the likes of wiki_link, wiki_link and other well-known lyricists, none of whose works are categorised as \"plays\". Indeed, I haven't found any other works within the scope of wiki_link that ''are'' categorised as \"plays\", so I can see no reason why Wodehouse should be treated differently from other lyricists. There are Wodehouse works that do fall into the category \"plays by \" (usually adapted from his own novels or from plays by foreign authors), but to conflate those with his work as a lyricist is misleading. There is a category for \"Works by PGW\", which already includes \"novels by \", \"short stories by\" and others; there is no reason why it can't also contain \"plays by \" and \"musicals by \", not as parent and child but as sibling categories. \n\nB: It looks like an attempt to by-pass the CFD, which is inappropriate, IMO. For now, until resolved by a future CFD, it can be in both categories, but it would be inappropriate to completely empty out the name that was selected by CFD. \n\nA: Bullshit. The CFD did not  and would not anyway have been the appropriate forum  decide that \"musicals\" are \"plays\". And to treat a  work in which a lyricist provides lyrics to a few songs as a \"play by -\" shows a total lack of understanding of the difference between a lyricist and a dramatist. But what the fuck.

In Mesut's case, his ethnicity raised political awareness of German's treatment of minorities as well as his non-Germanic name brought immediate attention as to where his roots belong, consequently contributing to his notability.
