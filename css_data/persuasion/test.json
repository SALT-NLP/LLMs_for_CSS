{"context":{"1385":"karnim: I'm going to boil down your post down to 2 main points:\n\n1 - You think it's okay to use stereotypes to create the basis for a character.\n\n2 - You don't think you need to worry about the minority of your audience.\n\nFor point 1, the problem isn't really stereotyping.  Yeah, stereotyping is bad, whatever.  The main thing is though, it just feels like cheap storytelling.  Your main character should be built from the ground up, not off a stereotype.  If the character *happens* to be black, fine, but if you go \"Well, it's a gang, so let's make them black\" before considering the character's, well, character then you're building a character off of something that's already broken.  Same goes for representing women.  The woman probably doesn't *need* to be represented as super sexy.  To represent her as such when her character wouldn't dress that way is just a cheap character build to get sales from teenage boys.  You *can* make sexy characters that are also strong, but it should be a part of their character.\n\nCompare the number of games out there with pointless but sexy guy characters to the number with pointless but sexy lady characters.  Clearly, there's some cheap character building going on with the women.\n\n\nAs for point 2.  You should include minorities in games for 2 reasons.  First off, it makes your fans happy. It's the same reason that TV shows and movies have minority characters. Most people don't mind, but it gives those minorities something to finally relate to in a main character.  It feels nice. The second reason is that it allows for more interesting story-telling. If your characters are all monochromatic, you lose a lot of potential drama and character growth.  For example, you could make a game about the civil war and have all-white troops, but then it would basically be CoD again. Add some black troops to the units, and it becomes much more interesting story-telling.\nthrowawayjr: &gt;First off, it makes your fans happy. \n\nTrue, but I still don't care about it.  I mentioned a bit earlier that my success hinges on opinion, and the consensus among others I've told, and apparently a few here, that I'm an asshole.\n\n&gt;The second reason is that it allows for more interesting story-telling. If your characters are all monochromatic, you lose a lot of potential drama and character growth. \n\nSomeone else took this angle, and I'm still not convinced.  If anyone is convinced that sexuality or racial tension can't make for a good story, someone should tell Hollywood.  Fastish.","4043":"nwf839: &gt; I cannot believe that the outer districts would simply stand for being forced to sacrifice children from their own communities for the sake of a sporting event whose very overt purpose is solely for the entertainment of the elite and the demoralization of the other districts.\n\nTerrorist leaders using women and children as suicide bombers with the goal of increasing their own political power\n\n&gt; I don't believe the elite could suddenly become so depraved that they would relish and cheer to watch children brutally murder one another, even if they were somewhat depraved. There is just a cognitive dissonance between their own sense of humanity and desire to live, and their joyous reception of the participants in the games, immediately followed by their cheering on their murdering one another. I can't get past that. I feel like there is meant to be a social commentary here, but I can't figure out what it is, perhaps if someone can point me to it it would help.\n\nThe Coliseum in Roman times\n\n&gt; Within the games themselves, the way certain groups of tributes gleefully ally with one another and hunt down others seems unbelievable. Alliances probably would happen, but they would be reluctant and untrusting of one another since at the end of the day, everyone knows there can be only one survivor and that at some point they would be murdered by their own ally. I'm not a game theorist but I'm pretty sure it wouldn't happen as depicted in the story.\n\nI don't think it's that unbelievable that people would revert to primal Machiavellian logic if they were put in a situation where they were being hunted.  Animals will do pretty much anything for survival.\nzjm555: Excellent examples. You've actually convinced me that point 1 and 2 might be believed. However, I think your point here: \n\n&gt; I don't think it's that unbelievable that people would revert to primal Machiavellian logic if they were put in a situation where they were being hunted. Animals will do pretty much anything for survival.\n\nIs what makes the human behavior in the book seem inconsistent to me. To believe #1, you have to believe that the people in the outer districts are so afraid of death that they willingly sacrifice children from their community. Which is actually believable -- shocking tactics are deployed in war as you say to instill fear in people so they will obey. And that's precisely why I can't buy point #3 if I do buy point #1 -- so many of the tributes seem *excited* at the prospect of the games, knowing that they will almost certainly die, or at least have to murder other people. That same primal fear that allows subjugation would also cause the tributes to behave very differently than they do.\n\nAnd I still have a slight problem believing point #2 even when compared to the coliseum, as I outlined in a response to another comment: \n\n&gt; But did they glorify the slaves before and after the battles, \"getting to know them\" as people like in THG? I feel like the only way people would be entertained by that is by seeing the combatants as subhuman, and if you \"get to know them\" and see them as human, it would suddenly be sickening. E.g., celebrating Katniss's romance and engagement, then cheering when she gets selected once again for the games just doesn't make sense.","5088":"elvish_visionary: While I agree with you that safe-driving cars will likely eventually become mainstream, I'm not sure where you got your time line from because it seems grossly exaggerated.

Even if the technology advances that quickly (very unlikely) it's still going to take a good 20+ years for society to accept them.\nDoScienceToIt: Of course it's all just ballpark estimates, but I still think that drivers in 16 years won't *need* to learn how to drive.

One has an enormous tatoo, the other doesn't.  A judgmental person may exclude the person with the tat - but it turns out the tatoo is in memory of a child she cared for who died of cancer.\n\nSome will judge someone who got divorced as a poor judge of character or unable to maintain a commitment.  But there are many other reasons why the marriage might not have worked out.\n\nA black man shows up at your store late at night, unshowered, unshaven and wearing sweats - but maybe he's a doctor returning from a grueling shift.\n\nThe full thought is that you might not know the whole story, so don't let your biases keep you from thinking things through.\ntherisinghippo: This is where I would bring in my jurisdiction argument.  If it doesn't directly or indirectly effect me, that is, it has no bearing on me, then I wouldn't even begin to judge anyway.  There is no reason to develop an opinion of someone if there is no impact on my life due to or possibly due to that person.  \n\nSo picking a babysitter, I reserve every right to judge anyone for any reason because I am choosing to leave my child with that person.  If I don't want my child to think that getting a tattoo, regardless of its meaning, is at any time acceptable, then I have every right to judge that tattooed babysitter.\n\nAs for the divorced person:  Personally, I don't believe in divorce unless there has been an unfaithful act or there is some sort of physical abuse going on. (I do not want to argue this point, so let's save it for another CMV).  That being said, I don't have much jurisdiction in this case.  His\/Her divorce has nothing to do with me.  However, should I be choosing a secretary or another subordinate in a professional setting, I should be able to judge them however I please due to my jurisdiction (I am aware at present time, employment laws prevent the consideration of familial status)\n\nI don't have jurisdiction over the unshowered man in sweats.  I am rational, and though if it were my store I would be prepared for any unusual situation, especially at night, but I wouldn't judge or specifically think he may be a more significant threat based on the information you gave me.  However, if he acted strangely, I certainly would judge him, nevertheless.\n\nGhost Edit: Typo","3555":"Hauntrification: Because then some people wouldn't be worth servicing (Little usage) while some people might be paying horridly high amounts because torrents, downloads, videos. The cost of internet mainly stems from the infrastructure and not so much from the data transfer itself while water and electricity have much more cost on what is actually being provided (That said, the infrastructure costs a bit too) but, since it is a basic necessity, the cost is offset by multiple people using said infrastructure in an area. While similar, given multiple internet providers and the fact that not everyone uses it, the infrastructure is much more expensive comparatively. This is again offset by the fact that the transfer of data itself is not as expensive.  \n\n\nEdit: What this means is that the primary driver is infrastructure and in a sense, it would be odd to charge based on consumption with super negligible costs on it. You can \"overload\" it and have a higher cost on consumption but that would be quite difficult especially given download speed limits.\n\n\nThe other aspect is electricity is a limited resource and so is water, while the internet? Not so much. So while it is morally repulsive to overuse water and electricity, such a limit is not as evident upon usage of the internet.\ncrustation: Thank you for your response. Does this imply that if the cost per usage is set very, very low, it would be reasonable? What if the price per usage amounts to a lower price than the current flat fee you are paying now, would you go for it?\n\nObviously, the concern is that people who don't use as much aren't worth servicing, but this doesn't happen with our regular utilities, so why should Internet access be any different?","2585":"scottevil110: I would only argue that \"special care\" should be taken when dealing with *anyone*, introvert or not.  Part of social interaction is reading the person with whom you're talking, and being sensitive to their personality.  You try to avoid rude jokes around people you know aren't going to like it, you try to not yell around people who get freaked out by that kind of thing, and you don't force awkwardness onto someone who doesn't like it.  I don't think it's \"kid gloves\" so much as just being aware of the situation and acting accordingly.  \n\nExtroverts have the advantage here because we're so used to engaging with people.  It's very easy for me to \"adapt\" my personality to fit a given conversation, simply because I've got so much practice talking to so many different types of people.  \nabutthole: I agree with what you're saying but it doesn't necessarily change my view. If I'm in a situation that is social by nature, such as work, and there's someone who identifies as an introvert I feel as though they should be making the attempt to be a bigger part of the social atmosphere than just quietly hoping that everyone else in the office would stop talking to them.

So your CMV really isn't \"cheerleading isn't a sport\" but rather \"athletic activities that are subjectively scored aren't sports.\" Correct? \n\nThat being said, the \"subjective\" scoring goes off of a strict and specific rubric and the graders are people with extensive experience in the \"sport.\" They aren't *really* going off of personal opinion; they're going off of a specific rubric and whether or not the athlete adequately performed each motion as per the rubric.

It's sort of a Zeno's Paradox when you start considering all the subjective influence an objective official can have without meaning to (barring obvious game fixing\/maliciousness), such that it is impossible to take a single step or action objectively.

Should women get special treatment? Should men be in charge? Should we take care of our sick? (you might be born one of the sick). \n\nEgalitarian just strives that each group is treated the same. The reason various hate groups get involved or leverage egalitarian is because many laws are written to favor one group of people. \n\nLet's start with affirmitive action. There are requirements for large companies to hire X percentage of minorities, but there is no law requiring them to hire X percentage of whites. Even though 99.9% of businesses wouldn't have an issue with that, the fact that one group is treated special over another is the problem.\n\nThere is an easy way to address this, and John Locke gave the answer. That is a just government must apply the law equally to all citizens. Impacts must fall on the citizens equally or fairly. Now in the case of taxes, this means a progressive tax system that no matter who you are, you pay based on income. But notice our laws for taxes isn't, \"blacks pay 5% less, Asians 1% less, and white pay full amount of taxes\". We don't have tax brackets for different races.\n\nSo various hate groups, or just different groups, always leverage egalitarian as a rebuttal. The reason feminism is attacked, is because much of feminism aims at helping one specific group (namely women). Like the women protection act, which does provide some help for men, but without a doubt mainly helps women. It is not difficult to write men equally into these laws as well. \n\nSo these groups see bills being passed, that exclude them, be it a hate group, or any group. But Egalitarian is merely the belief that each law should equally affect all groups. The idea that we can stop and frisk you because you look foreign is breaking John Locke's ideal government. \n\nAnd if we want to bring up something on reddit often, look at MGM vs FGM, one is banned in all forms, considered horrific, while the other one is encouraged by the CDC. Why, when FGM was banned, didn't we ban MGM? This is where MRA's get upset. Laws that put children with the mother because she has a vagina. That doesn't apply to all citizens equally. \n\nAnyway, I am rambling now. But Egalitarian is a method of deciding the right thing to do, various minority groups often join in because these groups see themselves as victims, and thus not being treated equally as others in the eyes of government and law. \n\nAnd to be fair, I think many of these people are right. I think we have coded much bias into our laws.  \nPasswordIsntHAMSTER: I generally agree with the spirit of your message, however some points stick out to me:\n\n* I don't feel like you're making a solid argument for Locke-style fairness. There is something to be said for equality of opportunity, which stands in opposition to equality of privilege as proposed by Locke.\n\n* FGM and MGM are deeply different. FGM is purely done to prevent women from experiencing pleasure, while MGM has historically been thought (mostly erroneously) to have health benefits. MGM is really fucking weird to me, but in the eye of the public it is not a settled thing whether it is actually problematic.\n\n* You haven't addressed my point about the disconnect between the theory of egalitarianism and how it is represented in reality; in particular, I haven't seen any self-styled egalitarian forums that aimed to supersede feminism rather than to oppose it.","2723":"kuury: 1.

While hedonism is generally a strive for material good and physical pleasures, I would take the term pleasure much more liberally and personally. Some people gain pleasure from those things, certainly. But some gain it from raising a family, or from helping the homeless, or whatever. I think as long as no one attempts to gain pleasure from hurting anyone, all of those are as valid as eachother. Basically, everyone would not be striving for the same objective pleasure, but for a personal subjective pleasure.","1125":"setsumaeu: I don't disagree with you in theory, however I am not particularly comfortable with giving the power to any particular group of people to decide what is and what isn't news. I'm sure the lines are quite blurry when you really dig deep, if they miss one correction do they get their title stripped? What if you have a talk show on a news network, do they have the same standard? I can't speak for other countries, but I would not be comfortable with this system in the US because of the political climate. With a two party system where power shifts back and forth, I think giving anyone the ability to decide what can and can't call itself news creates a potentially bad situation. \n\nYou've asked for us to prove what harm this could bring to the American people, I'd like to ask you what good it can bring. People tend to get their news from whatever they want, plenty of people rely on entertainment programs about the news (Daily show) or talk shows about the news (Rush limbaugh's show). If people care about the integrity of their news, why can't the public be trusted to self select what they should and shouldn't consume?\nilikedirigibles: If you read the full post it should be obvious:\n\nPer #4, A talk show on a news network has to be labeled as not news, and clearly wouldn't be subject to the must-not-lie rules, it just can't call itself a news program and air lies. And per #3 they can't air more than 50% non-news shows during primetime\/earlytime or they can't call themselves a news organization.\n\nMy point is, \"news\" has an inherent meaning in our society, it simply does, and calling yourself a news organization implies that what you say is true. You shouldn't be able to perpetuate FALSE information with impunity, and still call yourself a news organization.\n\nThe good that it would do is to limit the false information, like saying that, for instance, the Affordable Care Act will create death panels, which is objectively false, or the like. Purposely misleading the public under the guise of being \"news\" should be illegal.\n\nIt's not \"giving anyone the power to decide what can and can't call itself news\" -- it's simply targetted at objectively false information being purported as truth. \n\nPut simply, why is it ok that a trusted source of information lies?","1603":"binarysteen: I think you could also argue that, under the assumption\/widely accepted belief that all humans are inherently of equal worth, then they should inherently have an equal opportunity to be successful in life (by some definition of success). While it is inevitable that half of a population will live below average and half will live above it, your race etc. should not determine this. For example, 65% of black children are born into low income families compared to 32% of white children ([source](http:\/\/www.nccp.org\/publications\/pub_1074.html)). Children who grow up in poverty are seven times more likely to drop out of school between the age of 16 and 24, not to mention become involved in a number of other activities that do not lead to productive, successful, or particularly happy lives. And then the cycle continues until it's kind of hard to keep pushing this idea that all people are of equal worth.\n\nIt is certainly unreasonable to expect perfect equality. But it is not unreasonable to try and ameliorate the situation through social programs etc. Equality may be an unending battle, but it is one that is worth fighting so that a kid's path in the world isn't essentially predetermined before they're even born.\nSaquatucket: You make a good point, and I do agree that all people should have equal opportunity to succeed. But why does the argument for giving low income children this opportunity need to be based on racial equality, or even take race into account? Is providing equal opportunity to succeed not enough in itself? Why should we even take race into account in the first place, since a black child in poverty is worth precisely the same as an a Asian, white, Native American, or any other?","1864":"devicerandom: &gt;all I can think is that without the paragraph the \"art\" would be nothing more than a canvas, a pile of mud, a stick, or an unmade bed.\n\nAll artistic endeavours, without observers and their interpretation, are pointless. A painting, per se, is nothing more than a canvas. The most beautiful Canova sculpture is nothing more than a pile of rock. Bach, objectively speaking, is just wacky vibrations through air. Kubrick movies are just patches of colour moving on a screen. That's what they are objectively. It's us, the observers, that give aesthetic and cultural meaning to them. Art means something only when someone interprets it and puts it in the right context. \n\nOne can say that a Monet painting looks \"immediately\" nice to us, while a Fontana cut canvas doesn't. Yet, again, it is matter of context: paintings by Monet or Renoir looked ridicolous, grotesque and stupid to the average observer of that era, and even to some art critics (you can google about that). We are culturally used to find normal and even classic what, at Impressionists' time, was completely insane innovation, so we're not anymore finding them terrible.\n\nIt is true that modern art requires some more effort and contextualization to be understood and appreciated. And it is true that a lot of modern art is terrible, but a lot of *all* art was terrible: we only don't know this because with hindsight we selected the best works and artists and forgot the others. We don't have the same hindsight here and now.\nGaddness: Ok, it makes a lot more sense to me from that point of view, not going to stop me from thinking that selling someone an unmade bed when they have one that probably looks even better at home, is actually good art, I understand what you're saying in that we don't have the right context, just as a child can't comprehend the beauty of countryside until they are told it is something that should be admired, as, up until that point, it's simply grass, rocks and trees. Some pieces of modern art I like, like theres some canvases that at first I didn't like, but after a while looked good, but I still don't think they're worth what they're sold for.","5452":"Bluezephr: Meta's get established in any game, but in card games its very easy to see optimum strategies.

Unless you know the circumstances of one's life I'm not sure calling someone a \"scummy piece of criminal shit\" for a list of non-violent drug dealing charges demonstrates much understanding of the real world.

If anything, I would argue it takes more skill and difficulty to be able to master multiple functions at once compared to footballers who each have 1 specific function to master.\n\nFor example, linemen ONLY have to be big and learn how to block and \"wrestle\" but a shooting guard has to know how to dribble, shoot, set up screens, etc , etc.  \n\nIn order to be on an NBA team, arguably, you have to be elite at multiple skills rather than a few specific ones. IMO, this translates to more skilled players.\n\nTo your second point, I believe the starting and stopping cannot simply be ignored. In terms of physicality, constantly being in play takes a toll on the human body in the form of cardio and endurance and this is an athletic feat.  In other words, it's the argument of whether it takes more athleticism to be a long distance runner or a sprinter.  On this point, I think it's just a tie. They're separate sports and I don't think any one can be objectively declared better than the other.  However, I will add that as a sport, the stopping time is incredibly boring.\n\nTo your third point, there are a variety of plays that can be executed in football but I think the starting and stopping nature of the game detracts greatly from this.  In football, you have time to plan and consult your coach before pretty much every other play.  In basketball, players make split second decisions on plays and strategies which imo takes more skill and sports intelligence.\nJayYesBe: I agree with you that basketball players (and players in most other sports really) are more well-rounded than football players; that is significant. I don't know if the skills required in basketball (shooting, dribbling, setting picks, etc.) are more or less difficult to master than the ones in football. I'd have to be sold on that.\n\nI strongly disagree on the athleticism front. I agree with you that the sprinting\/distance debate is a bad debate. But this isn't that debate. Basketball and most other continually moving sports require more cardio endurance than football. But football requires a degree of cardio endurance AND a great deal of muscle exertion AND enduring pain and trauma. \n\nI also disagree that the stopping detracts from the strategy, but this may be a more subjective thing. I personally think the stopping gives football strategy an amazing complexity and depth. I agree that in basketball the split-second decision making is more challenging for the players, but basketball teams switch between only a handful of formations and run a handful of plays from those formations. \n\nI played basketball and think it's a great sport, but it's a less impressive athletic feat than football.\n","1552":"matthewrozon: There are lots of people who are fat because they lack the willpower to eat less and exercise more. You're right about that. But there are many other reasons why people get fat.\n\n1. Can't afford healthy food. If you have 2$ are you going to buy a head of lettuce or 2 mcdoubles?\n\n2. Don't have access to healthy food. There are these food deserts where only fast food is available.\n\n3. No time to plan or make food. So many Americans pride themselves on being \"workaholics\" like it's a good thing to work 80hours a week to live the dream. If you're working that much, plus commute, plus sleep, plus hygiene, where is the time to plan, shop for, and make healthy meals.\n\n4. Misinformation. The diet\/fitness industry preys on people who don't know how to or won't research. Most people who diet will end up putting on more weight than they lost after the diet ends. The only real way to lose weight is to permanently change your lifestyle so that calories in &lt; calories out but there isn't a lot of money in that.\n\n5. Genetics\/Disorders. A small amount of people who are overweight\/obese have disorders that make it extremely hard to lose weight or to not gain weight. Then there are people whose genes put them at a disadvantage, sure plenty of people stay thin even if their body stores more fat than someone else but couple bad genes in addition to a lack in willpower or any of these other reasons and you have a recipe for disaster.\n\n\nLastly, concentrating on overweight\/obese is important. One thing that really surprised me however is that using the BMI definitions, being overweight did not correlate to a higher incidence of heart disease or cardiac problems when compared to normal weight. So really \"overweight\" in terms of BMI anyway isn't that bad. Also BMI sucks as an indicator of body weight.\nskulgun: Point 1: OK, but rice and beans is a thing.

Or it may predict that they find a more efficient way to use that coal, and delay the process. But the models won't be able to predict that country figuring out that oil (or something similar to that), which they previously thought was useless, can be used as a supplement to coal.","5129":"Cheeseboyardee: Honestly the difficulty in prosecution would be enough to make this an issue. \n\nNext is the question of who decides what is the \"truth\".

What about a different class of rape jokes, in which someone makes mention of a woman they dislike, and then says something to the effect of, \"what she needs is for a man to take her out in a back alley, hold her down and have his way with her.\"  With a grin perhaps, so you can tell that it's definitely a joke.  \nomashupicchu: To answer your question, I'm a little on the fence about rape culture. I'm tempted to say it doesn't exist any more than a culture of violence in general, which again, I wouldn't call a culture. \n\nPeople like to live vicariously through violent movies and games but this doesn't mean that they would necessarily do these things or condone them in real life. Likewise, I don't think there is any compelling evidence that suggests that making these jokes perpetuates, among the people who say them or the people who hear them, a cavalier attitude towards rape that happens in real-life.   \n\nYour example does make me hesitate, however.\n\nI would say that it's not that much kinder than saying, \"Someone needs to kick that jerk's ass,\" or something to that effect. Beating someone up is awful and the prospect of getting the shit kicked out of you is terrifying, no matter who you are.  \n\nAgain, though, it's something that many people talk about but never actually do.

I think the expression about someone needing to \"have his way with her\" is ugly and not one that I would ever use or ever want to hear but I honestly don't know. \n\nI just find it difficult to reconcile the way we normalize some violent expressions but find that others retain their ability to revolt us.

People believe claims about Zoe Quinn based on evidence that they wouldn't take seriously about any person who they took seriously to begin with, and people always seem to bring up unrelated ideas, like social justice, in criticizing her. So I think it's reasonable to defend her from criticism that's unfair.\nedmiborn: I can understand that. A lot of the criticism does seem to be rooted in misogyny.

Most laws are pretty much designed to prevent or reduce human suffering where possible. As babies can suffer, I can't see many people considering it morally acceptable to kill them. Plus, if it's no longer murder, how does this relate to other laws regarding treatment of fellow humans? Can babies be tortured before their birth certificates are signed? Raped? Scarred or mutilated? \n\nTo legalise such a thing would pretty much go against the entire reason we have laws. Abortion is already legal in plenty of places (and can be campaigned for if it's not); if someone does not want a baby, they can have an abortion. If they birth the child and still don't want it, they can give it up for adoption. With these laws in place, it's unecessary to kill off unwanted babies and thus nobody would support it or support a government that wanted it. \n\n&gt;Fathers could opt out of child support by not signing the birth certicate. The number of single parent households would drop because the baby would not have been born until both parents sign the birth certificate. Until the baby has been born, the birth certificate filed, it would not be a citizen.\n\nI'm aware that child support laws are debated at the moment, but I'm not going to get into that right now apart from to say this situation would benefit nobody except the few fathers who don't want to be fathers. Let's imagine that suddenly a lot of men have a way to not support their children (or vice versa, assuming the mother is also allowed to give up her parental rights in the same way). This then means there's a lot of single mothers who need more help to raise children. Where are they going to get that help from? The government, because I can't see developed countries shrugging and saying that children and mothers need to starve on the streets. That means more taxpayer money to support one-parent children. Therefore this is harmful both to the government and the population. \n\nOr, to go even further, say that the father agrees to pay child support throughout the pregnancy, but when the baby is born he goes back on this agreement. Let's assume the mother is also allowed to refuse to sign the birth certificate and now does so because she doesn't want to be burdened with a child with only her to support it. What happens to be baby now? We've already discussed that post-birth abortions aren't going to happen, so we just have even more children using the taxpayers' money, which - once again - is beneficial to nobody but a very slim minority of parents. \n\n[Edit: Also, to say 'the number of single parent households would drop' is like the police saying 'thefts have dropped' because they've been calling everything lost property. The babies are still there and still need to be provided for, not recognising them doesn't change that apart from making the stats misleading.]\n\n&gt;Cases of misattributed paternity could be eliminated by requiring a paternity test before the father could sign the birth certificate. Prenatal genetic testing can identify paternity as an incidental finding. Birth certificates would identify the parents of the child and not the people intending to raise it so anonymous sperm and egg donation would be illegal.\n\nFor most people, there's no need to require anything, so this would just be needless paperwork that would get in the majority's way, not to mention - once again - expensive to fund. In cases where a paternity test is desired, the parents can already get one without needing all this extra legislation. \n\nFurthermore, how would this even work? Would there be a time frame to sign the certificate? Could parents keep the kid but kill it off if they got bored after a few years? Could a forgetful parent accidently prevent their kid from becoming a citizen? The whole thing just seems ridiculously impractical to me. \n\nEssentially, this proposal would be very expensive to fund (laws aren't simple and take a lot of work), is actively harmful to humans and thus immoral, would provide slim-to-no benefits for the majority of people, whilst making them pay for it, and is generally unnecessary considering that abortions are already a thing, as are adoptions. \nkrausyaoj: It would reduce the number of children without the support of two parents. Those babies where the parents don't sign the birth certicate woud be destroyed. There would be an exception if one of the parents died but DNA was able to confirm the relationship.\n\nThe public outcry would be similar to that now concerning abortion. Babies no more suffer from death than animals as they lack an understanding of life. The treatment of babies before they are legally born would be similar to that of other animals.\n\nRequiring both parents to sign and support the baby would reduce single parent households lessening the public burden. If either parent refuses to sign the birth certificate it is destroyed so as to not be a burden.\n\nThe parents would need to have a birth certicate before they could take the child from the hospital because they would not be recognized as its parents.\n\nA paternity test only costs about $100 and many prenatal genetic tests include paternity as an incidental finding.\n\nThe opposition to infanticide is due to our religious heritage and the effects it had on our culture. As religion declines I hope that support for infanticide increases and it will be legal again as it was in Roman times.","1811":"k4m414: I think the simplest way to describe it, is an arrogant person is only happy in being right if the other person is wrong.

After a test, they don't run over to you and ask what score you think you got just so they can say \"well I think I got a 100.\" \n\nSo if a person has low confidence, I think a truly confident person would be sensitive to that.

The initial National Assembly passed a \"self denying ordinance\" which declared that no National Assembly member would be allowed to serve in the newly created Legislative Assembly.  That basically kicked out all the leaders who were most prominent in French politics, and left the new assembly rudderless and without the trust of the people necessary to keep from giving in to popular, but dumb, demands.

However, that very event could be used in order to establish nuances within this measure that would prevent that from happening.

Absolutes aren't particularly useful. However, I think I can argue why there is almost always a **better** argument to be made, mainly because the \"Nazi comparison\" is a lazy shorthand and hence should rarely be used.\n\nFirst of all, let's look at the two examples you provided of when it is a bad argument. In both cases what the comparison is made in lieu of a real argument. Instead of saying ***why*** X is bad or A is wrong, the person is taking shortcuts. They are saying, \"we all know the Nazis are bad, and they did X, so hence X is bad\". As you said, this is a bad argument, especially if X = driving tanks or something else irrelevant to why we dislike Nazis.\n\nHowever, the argument is still equally lazy if it is used somewhere else. If I say \"genocide is bad because the Nazis did it\", the shorthand seems relevant. However, I'm still not showing ***why*** genocide is bad. I'm skipping the step. \n\nWhy is this a bad thing? Surely everyone knows the Nazis are bad because of genocide. Well, if I'm trying to convince someone that genocide is bad, then failing to show why genocide is bad isn't going to work. I can't say \"Don't eat cyanide, it's a poison.\" to someone who doesn't know that poison is bad.\n\nIt might be useful in my explanation of ***why*** genocide is bad, to  discuss the Nazis. It may be useful in a discussion of eugenics, or the death penalty. But on it's own, without context, it isn't an argument.\n\nThere are of course issues of people using it as a way of ending an argument by claiming unassailable moral ground, which is what u\/tvrr did. By making the Nazi comparison, he attempts to frame any arguments *against* his position as being in *support* of the Nazis. This is both lazy debate, and unconvincing.\n\nIf he had put in why it was like Nazi Germany even it may be a defensible or valid point. By failing to do so, he stifles debate on a subreddit devoted to it. The downvotes are well deserved in my opinion (well, at least as many to remove his comment from view, beyond that is unnecessary.)\nfalafelsaur: I disagree with your characterization of the use of Nazis as a shortcut. I'd say instead that they are used as a counterexample (when used correctly). In a genocide discussion the use of Nazis is silly simply because there is no apparently correct principle to provide a counterexample to.\n\nIn the example I showed, Westlondonwannabe made a general statement that it is okay to X under Y conditions, however tvrr provided an example where Y conditions seem to be met, and yet we all agree that it was not okay to do X. This clearly means that either the something in the statement needs to be clarified, or extra conditions need to be added. tvrr may not know exactly what the correct clarification or additional conditions are, however she\/he still knows that the original statement was not exactly correct due to the counterexample.\n\nAs something of a side note: I understand that tvrr didn't stated this in a way that seems open to debate, and it may be that he is not and indeed does want to \"frame any arguments against his position as being in support of the Nazis\", and yes that would be bad faith discussion. However, why do we need to respond to his (apparent) intentions, rather than the content of his statement?","1043":"MonkeyButlers: I've got a tortoise.

Because it's the only way in this system to fairly gauge how well a LD student knows high school curriculum compared to a non-LD student. I think if you spent more time with students who are actually LD and did some real research on it you'll end up thinking that giving them more time on a standardized test is the least that could be done to help them get into a decent school. \njtmarmon: &gt;Since you're still in high school and haven't been to college yet I'll tell you something you might not know which is that Colleges usually have more learning disability accommodations than high schools.\n\nI'm going to pretend like that wasn't facetious\n\n\nMost of my experience is with the ACT.  The ACT has very little to do with curriculum.  It is almost entirely reasoning skills and speed.

The point of blackface is to dress up as a black person. The point of drag is to dress in clothes reserved for another gender, not to portray a \"character\" that is actually transgender. Furthermore I never got the impression that drag was meant to \"lampoon the idea of crossdressing\" since crossdressing is, you know, what drag is.\n\nCertainly I think the drag community could afford to be more informed and sensitive about transgender issues (I know a lot of drag queens that use terms like \"tranny\" in ways they really shouldn't). But I can certainly imagine ways in which drag shows could go on without stepping on any toes, even if very few of them manage to do that at this point.\nOvertFemaleUsername: Inevitably though, they do end up portraying a character. Even though it may not be a transgender person, the comparison is often drawn afterwards and is still damaging to those who are actually gender variant.

They then sell the product in the hopes that they will take in more money than it cost to produce. I think the idea that \"the company should produce the product, but the customer gets to decide if it should be free or not\" is unfair to the company. They take a significant risk by focusing their resources on a given product, and they therefore have a right to set its price.\n\nAs for the last point, would an entire industry spend all of this money on anti-piracy measures, measures which they know offend and turn off a number of customers, if they didn't see some value in it? Either it does significantly negatively impact sales, or it offends them that people are taking the stuff they worked so hard on without paying them for their effort. In either case, it's their choice what to do with their product, and branding them evil for wanting to be paid for their risk and effort is unreasonable. This applies to the second to last point, too. If their efforts to stop piracy are so intrusive, the legitimate consumers can decide to look for better products elsewhere.

One small example is if you work in an industry where you deal with a lot of names and families and meeting people blind (like I do).

Does someone with a confusing last name owe it to us to choose a more traditional last name?\nNeoshadowXC: The step families and non-married families are fine as they are-- it would be useful as a sign right up front that the kid is adopted or a step child. But of course that only works if all other families use the same name. \n\nAs to your second point, what I'll say is that what other people have been suggesting to me: two last names serves as a better road map for who is related to who. In that way, if there was a widely adopted system where EVERYONE used two last names (like in Spain), there would be more uniformity and would actually make finding connections between people easier.\n\nAs to Smith-Jones vs Krzyzewski, I think Krzyzewski &gt; Smith-Jones. Something about the hyphen. Takes away from the roundness of the name. I'm not going to defend this point of view, I already know it's entirely irrational. To that end, I will say that for every Smith-Jones, you also get a Krzyzewski-Mrzyglocki.","3320":"DerekReinbold: First, you only consider the worst qualities of religion. Somebody who would maim another person because of a disagreement over religious beliefs (i.e. killing all infidels, burning heretics, etc.), were they not religious, would still be terrible. Though religion gives a sense of righteousness to their actions, they would find similar justification elsewhere.\n\nSecond, the practicality of banning religion is ludicrous. Ever read 1984? You'd have to institute a thought police gestapo to even come close. \n\nThird, most religious people are kind-hearted. Your militant atheism is precluding you from seeing this. You regard people like this as \"ignorant in the traditional sense, in that they do not even know what they are truly supposed to be believing.\" Just because you value complete logic, or whatever it is that guides your philosophy, does not mean that something of that nature is important to everyone. Religion can bring a sense of community, of belonging, regardless of its factual veracity. Point is, beside its status as true or false, religion has value. It has value because people have given it value, and in human terms that is meaningful.\n\nFinally, please consider that your viewpoint is just that, *your* viewpoint. Someone disagreeing with you is not necessarily wrong, they are simply operating from a different set of premises. Understanding this is part of growing up.\nStarJeweledPro: First off, I do not think your claim that most people who commit heinous acts in the name of religion would find similar justification elsewhere. Yes, some are evil - however, most have simply been radicalized because of their faith. Take a look at some fundamentalist Muslim countries, where lynch mobs attack women who fail to wear their veils. Are we to somehow assume that every person out of this mass is a sociopath? I do not think that is likely. Yes, some people will continue to be evil, and find different justifications (or channels), but doing away with religion would cause an end to much social tension created by the syncretic difficulties of merging the belief systems, as well as the radicalization effect many more fervent believers suffer.\n\nSecond. You do point out that you would need a \"thought police Gestapo to even come close.\" While eliminating *thoughts* (that is, private religious belief which is not expressed to others) is an impossible task, with modern surveillance techniques, as well as the level of societal control which can be readily enacted, eliminating any *display* of religion could be at least attempted. At this time in history, the social backlash and amount of effort needed would be too great even in countries such as Norway and Finland, but there is no reason why such a crackdown could not be at least attempted with some degree of success in the moderate future.\n\nYour third argument is the most interesting of the arguments, because it argues that religion's positives, when practiced in a \"positive way\" (i.e. liberal\/moderate), outweigh its negatives. You then follow up with the claim that [to paraphrase] because I value logic above all else doesn't mean that everyone else does or should.\n\nThe problem here is that logic is, objectively, the supreme trump card. If religion causes these good effects - we must also look at what societal ills it is causing, and then see whether it is causing more good or bad in the world. Simple utilitarianism. Whether it has been given value \"in human terms,\" i.e. without objective calculation or logic, is irrelevant in the \"big picture\" of things. What is important is the overall effect it has on society. Unfortunately, since we don't have a calculator that can tell us how much good versus bad religion has done in the world, we have to guess.\n\nAnd what sort of guess we can make? You note that religion brings a sense of community and belonging to many people. But why do we need religion to achieve these things? Why, rather than uniting upon such things as a shared culture, history, or even nation, must we unite upon fairy tales which tell us to stone our children?\n\nThere is no reason other than tradition as far as I can see. The benefits religion provides, at least according to my initial estimates, do not even come close to matching the negatives. Call it cold, call it remote and inhuman - but utilitarianism (at least when not taken to ridiculous extremes) is the best way.\n\nFinally, you say that my viewpoint is *my* viewpoint, and someone disagreeing with me is not necessarily wrong, but simply operating from a different set of premises.\n\nWhat you do not mention is that, by definition, in an argument with two or more distinct \"sides\" which can be taken, someone is always wrong. Someone has to be wrong, or they wouldn't be arguing over it. Because of this, it either means they are operating on incorrect premises, or using premises that may be either correct or incorrect to draw an incorrect conclusion. For example, if someone walked up to you and said that 2 + 2 = 7, would you correct them because their view is obviously incorrect, or would you not do so because they are simply operating on \"different premises\" and therefore entitled to their own view of things? We can say that all views are entitled to equal respect and treatment - however, only one of these views can actually be correct.

Who wanted to cuddle whenever you did, who wanted the same things in life, who wanted sex when you did, whose schedule never clashed?\n\nMy counter-question is: why on earth is it considered the norm to expect there to be 1 person to do all that, to whom we pledge our life and faithfulness forever and ever, etc? Imagine if this were applied to *literally* anything else, how absurd it would be. Imagine if, once you'd made a friend, you were expected to only ever hang out with that one friend for the rest of your life. Or just that one drinking buddy, or work at just that one job forever.\n\nNow, there are some differences with relationships and sex, obviously, but the premise still stands. I think everyone has been in some part of a \"love triangle\" at one point or another, and that is caused entirely by this notion that there's this one special person, which just seems absurd when looked at objectively: if there were just one special person, why on earth could someone have feelings for 2 (or more) people at once?\n\nThis has gotten a bit all over the place, but the rub of it is: open relationships\/polyamory aren't for everyone, but that doesn't mean they're just for people who are afraid of commitment. I've known some poly couples who have their home and kids along with their separate boy\/girlfriends. It's just different, is all. They're just as committed and loving, if not moreso, than the monogamous couples i know.\nCaligirlsrock: I hear you.

One of the things I really love about \"Sherlock\" is how remarkably true to the books it is, while still being modernized. The comparison scenes you gave about the story of their meeting is a good example. The way they met on the show, including Watson's back-story, is exactly how it was done in the book. The first meeting between them at the university where Holmes was beating a corpse to learn about post mortem bruise development was almost word for word how it happens in the book, right down to the way Holmes analyzed Watson on the spot. The only difference between the show and the books was that in the books Holmes deduced a number of things from his pocket watch, whereas in the show it was his phone.\n\nAnd the Characters in the show are, in my opinion, the best representation of the characters as they appear in the book I have ever seen. Particularly Watson! Cumberbatch is fun to watch of course, and his Holmes is, in my opinion, spectacular, but the character that always seems to get messed up in movies is Watson. Because the books are written from his perspective, he never really describes himself in the books, and in some ways his character is the hardest to discern. I think the actor who plays Watson in \"Sherlock\" has done an absolutely phenomenal job of bringing that character to life.\n\nFrom your description of \"Elementary\" it is simply not Sherlock Holmes. And that's fine. It make be a perfectly well done television show and very worthy of praise, and I will take your good recommendation and download it. But from your description, it is not Sherlock Holmes, it is simply Sherlock Holmes inspired, or themed if you will.\nmrbroscience: That does seem to be the tale of it. Elementary according to other commenters (I've never read the books) are saying it's more a Doyle inspired work, and not really beholden to the true source material. So it could be just another show with neat characters but not really an \"update\" more of a re-imagining. Almost complete re-work.

Where would the line between normal and extraordinary be drawn?

Changing the rules would be difficult because of legislative and other legal processes.\n\nBatman, on the other hand, isn't in control of a massive machine that might take his intent incorrectly. Batman- an individual- has the mind to deal with every situation in a unique way and is not bound by a protocol that could have unintended consequences.

Race\/Religion\/Sexual Preference\/etc. We decided those were important not because they're any more sacred than anything else, but because of the degree of discrimination that we've seen in the past, and because they're easy to identify. \n\nYou're right, there are a billion things that people get discriminated on every day. \n\nWe have stuff like favorite sports teams, what kind of car you drive, and even the stuff you brought up like belief in aliens. That stuff may result in discrimination, but it's not as widespread or as apparent as race or religion. And also, if you do believe in crazy stuff, it's very easy to hide it from your professional life. You can't really hide being black. While you can \"hide\" your religion, religious discrimination is very powerful and if anyone wants to, they can fairly easily find out if you follow a religion.\n\nHeight, weight, and attractiveness are probably reasons for discrimination just as much as some of the protected ones - but those are very hard to quantify.

What is attractive? \n\nSo it all boils down to a few things that we, as a society, have selected as being not only important, but easy to see. \nbalancespec2: Height weight and attractiveness are things you cannot change (well some of them are anyway), those are irrelevant to this point.\n\nThe point being, you can \"hide\" your views when appropriate, and it would be wise to do so if you think they may be used against you.\n\nWhy should a view be legally protected by society just because it happens to be a popular one?

Even the most savvy of Googlers needs to know the basis of what they're researching before they can know what direction to direct their prowess on the search engines.  I agree that schools should be evolving more with the times and acknowledging the fact that being able to find something on the internet isn't \"cheating,\" but rather wise resource management, but I think that's a matter of simply adjusting the standards by which they evaluate students, rather than changing the subject matter entirely.\n\nA large part of school, also, is attempting to provide the most objective picture of the world without editorializing, which can be tough on the internet.  Something like history class comes to mind.  School can teach basic facts and consequences that are going to be tough to find on the internet, knowing that you have a trustworthy source for your information.\n\nWith something like math, it's incredibly important to understand WHY things come out the way they do, rather than just being able to punch it into a graphing calculator and seeing what comes out.  It greatly increases your grasp of the concept behind why something integrates the way it does, which allows you to make better conclusions about it.\n\nI would amend the stance to say that schools need to accept the fact that there are new, valid tools to gaining knowledge that didn't used to exist, and simply integrate that into our expectations of students, rather than saying we need to actively attempt *teaching* them how to use this technology.  The fact is that nothing can teach you those things better than just doing it.\nHP844182: I agree with just about everything you said, but my only concern was about learning objective pictures of the world, especially history.

It would be up to the people in the relationship.\n\n&gt; \u2022Related to the above, how does divorce work? Can it fail due to disagreement?\n\nDivorce works as it always has.

What if a whole town decides to get married, imagine the work untangling that will be.\n\nIf prenuptial agreements had been made it wouldn't necessarily be that difficult. It would be more complex sure, but I don't think it's that great an argument against it.\n\n&gt; \u2022What if one person is in the hospital and there are two others that can make a life or death decision, and disagree?\n\nAs currently, medical staff have the power to make decisions for a person who lacks capacity. They could take over the decision making for the short-term (acting in the best medical interests of the patient) and the spouses can go to court to challenge any longer term decisions they make e.g. turning off life support machine. This would be the type of issue that people would be encouraged to address in pre-nuptial agreements.\n\n&gt; \u2022There are practical social issues. Eg, rich man gets himself 20 wives.

You would have to pay workers the competitive rate set by the market. Since illegal immigrants can't access the basic income scheme, they would be living on starvation wages. So BI would lower illegal immigration, whereas the existing scheme would not. \ngobears10: What about right now? We have undocumented immigrants in the U.S. being paid below the minimum wage.

Maybe even the competitive market wages in the U.S. would offer a higher standard of living for undocumented workers in the U.S. than in their home countries. I know some states offer in-state tuition for young undocumented immigrants, but they largely cannot draw welfare benefits already.

There would be no strong countervailing force against companies that artificially lower pay via oligopsony power in the labor market. \n\nMy solution to undocumented immigration without implementing BI is to offer a pathway to citizenship for current undocumented immigrants in the U.S. Pass the DREAM Act.

That's a nice change around here.\n\nWhile these are problems, the economy is not destined to fail.  It's a living organism like anything else, and it will adapt to the changing time.  It's a self-correcting problem in many cases.  If there are only 3 rich people left, they can't get richer anymore because there isn't anyone left to give them money for anything.  It becomes in their best interest to keep money flowing through the economy.\n\nRegarding student loans, you've hit the nail on the head.  It's far too easy to get a loan these days, but what is the alternative?  If banks stop giving out loans for colleges, the new rally cry will be \"Banks are discriminating against poor people and making it so only rich people can go to college and better themselves.  The rich get richer!\"  And they'd be right.  \n\nThe root of this problem isn't that it's so easy to get a loan.  It's that everyone believes they need to go to college now.  People take out $100,000 in debt, without any idea what they're even going to spend it on, and then only later does it occur to them that they have to pay that back somehow.  And since we've got this mentality now that college is basically High School: Part 2, colleges can basically charge whatever they want, because we're all under the impression that if you don't go to college, you're basically fucked.\nWumboWombo: I'm not so sure your first point is true. If there are only 3 rich people left, they will have A LOT of money. They have no incentive to circulate it, as it won't earn them more money, at least in theory.\n\nI believe we both agree on that, but wouldn't it do more good than harm? The college market is oversaturated, we agree, people are convinced they need a degree to get a good job. What defines \"a good job\"? My friend makes less than me, but he doesn't have an $800 a month loan payment. When my loan is paid off, I'll be better off, but I'll be in my 40's, my life at least 1\/2 over. \n\nIf loans were harder to get, don't you think people would start to realize how much they don't need college? \n\n","3414":"piepi314: I think you're looking at this all wrong. While I agree that they desensitize people to a fire alarm, it isn't all about getting everyone out as quickly as possible. A lot of the purpose of fire drills is to give staff an opportunity to practice herding people to safety. \n\nAlso, keep in mind that even in the event of a real fire, people have a relatively large amount of time to get to safety when it is in a large building. So in a matter of speaking, desensitizing people helps calm people down and prevent a panic that causes harm to people. \nludicrousursine: &gt; A lot of the purpose of fire drills is to give staff an opportunity to practice herding people to safety.\n\nThis seems like a good point, but as I touched on in my original post, the only times I have really seen this in practice are in elementary-high school where the teacher leads people out through the nearest exit, takes a strict head count, and the administrative staff inspects. However, in my experience this stops being the case for drills in other places. In university classes when there is a drill, the professors generally don't give instructions on what to do, nor do they check that people behind them actually leave. In dorms and living spaces, most of the people aren't even within view of the staff, and staff is among the first to leave the building, not giving instruction to people who are exiting their rooms. I really don't see much point in this. \n\nEven in grade school it seems like the frequency is far too high. Multiple drills every month seems ridiculous, when everyone has the procedure down after the first couple drills.","4415":"420big_poppa_pump420: One thing that you have to remember is that Hank is willing to let things that he would normally be against  go if they serve the greater good. \n\nRemember when Buck was banned from Jugstore Cowboy's?

Most older games DON'T stand the test of time, and are forgotten.**  \n     \nAnd yes, there are definitely some games that everybody acts like are still great, when they actually would be shitty (today) without nostalgia.  Probably the best example of this is Goldeneye 64, a great game at the time that people feel a lot of nostalgia for, but is almost objectively bad by any modern standard.  But I don't think that applies to all \"classics.\"    \n    \nBut try looking at the issue in reverse.  There are some modern games which are well received despite the fact that they don't really push the envolope in terms of modern technology.

Or league of legends, one of the most popular games in the world.  I'm not a computer expert, but I'm guessing it's not exactly pushing the envelope of modern technology.

Now there are new ones that are a whole lot more futuristic AND have the old ones beat in terms of performance. People will always like the old ones though because of, what I believe, is a nostalgic sense. It goes back to the saying I hear a lot: \"the good old days.\" People always remember things in the past a lot better than they actually were by comparison to things that aren't as good today.

When a thoughtful critic says he enjoyed a movie, he is not saying the same thing as when he calls it great.\n\nJust so, many people do in fact merely mean that they didn't like a movie when they call it overrated. But many others use it correctly - they do mean that they've looked at its merit (I don't know that I want to get into the issue of what criteria should be used) and believe others are making a mistake when they rate it highly.\n\nIn short, I don't think it's reasonable to assume that people calling something \"overrated\"\/\"underrated\" are any more likely to be lazy than people calling something \"bad\", great\", or any other judgment.  If anything, I think the people calling something overrated\/underrated are less likely to be lazy.  They have at least gone to the trouble of learning what others say about the issue.\n\nAdmittedly, I don't look at movie reviews so often as product reviews.  When I see product reviews calling something overrated or underrated, my experience is that the person making the review has done more research than the average reviewer.\nDHCKris: I understand where you're coming from, but I have seen people use the phrase \"overrated\" when they've heard something is amazing, or saw it on IMDB's top 250 or something, and didn't enjoy it.\n\nI think it's hard to argue that influence didn't take place. \n\nLet's say you heard that Velvet Underground &amp; Nico is one of the greatest albums of all time (it is). You heard it completely removed from its historical context. You might think it sounds like shit (it does), that it is too repetitive, that Lou Reed and Nico have terrible singing voices, etc. But the reason it is great is BECAUSE it sounds like shit. It was basically a big \"fuck you\" to commercialized, over-produced rock and roll, and showed that you could create something innovative and experimental on a tiny budget with limited recording equipment. The guitars are tuned wrong on purpose to give it a unique sound. I think music is more \"stuff that sounds interesting\" than \"stuff that sounds good and appealing.\" The grating, dissonant chords of punk rock that VU anticipated might not sound lovely or beautiful, but they create an emotional feeling, they stimulate you aurally in a way pop music hadn't before. That's why people love it.\n\nBut even after reading all that, you might say, \"I don't get it. Music is supposed to sound good, and this doesn't sound good. People like it because it sounds shitty? This is so stupid and overrated!\" But that would be making a judgment about other people that is uncalled for. Why can't you just say, \"well, okay, this isn't for me, but it was influential, and this is why, but I don't understand why that makes it good. Anybody care to explain?\"\n\nI guess this could end up becoming a semantic argument. I suppose I'm only talking about when people use \"overrated\" in this particular way. Basically my argument is: influence is undeniable, and greatness is merely a measure of influence. To successfully accuse something of being \"overrated\" would mean to prove, through research, that it wasn't actually as influential as critics say it was, which is certainly possible, but not what people on the Internet mean when they say \"overrated.\"\n\n\n\n","3727":"DeathlyAcorn: You don't know it would last, though.

That seems to be in tension with your claim that we should have universal healthcare, though, because universal healthcare requires taking huge sums of money from some people to give to others, which arguably violates the rights of the people who earned the money. So you need to explain what you think rights are if you take that route.\nzelda2013: Let's tackle it one at a time:\n\nGay Marriage: I feel that it is intrinsically disordered with respect to Natural Law (insofar as it relates to reproductive ability); however, I believe that they should be able to marry and at least adopt children.

After all, all public policy helps some people and hurts others, the ability to judge whether it helps more than it hurts often comes down to definitions and assumptions that are not universal.

It's essentially the same with paintings, songs, films, operas, dance... whatever you can think of. They all (usually) exist to tell a story. Sure, you could just tell a story, but that's boring. Even in a novel, you will rarely read a line such as \"Sarah was 20. She has blue eyes and blonde hair.\" Instead you will read something along the lines of, \"Sarah's beauty had become more obvious to Mark now that she was no longer a teenager. Her flowing blonde hair and deep blue eyes made his heart flutter each time he caught a glimpse of them.\" Authors write like this simply because it is more interesting. Poetry was born as another way to tell a simple story in an interesting way.\n\nTo me, I would assume that poetry became popular originally because it was easy to mass produce.

I would bet money I can type that faster than you can move there manually either with the arrow keys or with the mouse. \n\n&gt; Yes I know that you can navigate with the arrow keys but most people seem to think that is a bad idea for some reason, or somehow makes you less efficient, even though it saves keystrokes. \n\nThe motivation for not using the arrow keys is that it takes your hand away from the home row. Everything you need to do can be accomplished without ever needing to move your hand that far. Taking your hand off the home row is slower because you have move your hands over there, and because it's less precise. \n\n&gt; Another example is saving a document, which takes 3-5 keystrokes in vim depending on if you are currently in insert mode or not (esc-&gt;:-&gt;w-&gt;enter-&gt;i) vs 2 in other editors (ctrl+s) and those 2 can basically be hit in parallel so its even better. \n\nIf you miss that particular keybind, you can just add something like this to your vimrc\n\n    nnoremap &lt;C-s&gt; :w&lt;cr&gt;\n\nLike I said before, if you want to get the most out of vim you have to be comfortable changing it's settings to suit your style. \n\n\n&gt; 4) Using the keyboard instead of the mouse is not necessarily faster. Obviously the keyboard is great for many things, but for moving the cursor to an arbitrary position on the screen, a mouse is better. \n\nCan you give an example? If you can see the place you want to move on the screen, you can type either the line number or the relative line distance between where you are and your target to get there much faster than you can move your hand to the mouse. Or you can jump straight there using `\/` or `?` to search for the words around the text you want to jump to. Or you can use the `f` or `t` commands to jump to a given character. Or you can jump to a location you've bookmarked. Or you can use `{`, `}`, `[[` or `]]` to navigate by paragraphs. Or a number of other options. \n\n&gt; People talk about the overhead of moving your hand to the mouse, but its really not that far, and its more automatic than pressing a key sequence that depends heavily on the where you want to put the cursor relative to where it is now.\n\nA skilled Vim user will have these movements in muscle memory. If you've only been at it two weeks, you haven't had time to build up the muscle memory to really make movement fast and intuitive. \n\nAre you just learning it on your own or are there people you know or work with that can give you tips and tricks? Have you watched any vimcasts [like this series](http:\/\/vimcasts.org\/) about how to do things efficiently? Vim is not a general purpose text editor for the average joe, it's a specialized tool that is not intended to be dumbed down for beginners, it takes effort to make full use of it. \n\nIf you haven't already, I urge you to read over [this post](http:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/a\/1220118\/63791)\n\n&gt; 5) The interface is undiscoverable. \n\nThis is true, but like I was just saying, vim is not a tool designed for user-friendliness, it's designed for raw efficiency. There is however extremely comprehensive help files, so if you want to know something you can usually type `:h &lt;topic&gt;` and get some useful information.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention, if you're using stock gVim, it does come with menus by default, if you want to use them to get used to the keybinds. I usually turn them off first thing though since I know the important stuff and they just clutter my screen. \n\n&gt; Compare to vim, where if you think vim can do something but don't know how, you have to read the manual, or search google, both of which take longer than looking through a few menus.\n\nI will agree that Vim can have a larger up front cost in terms of learning how to use it, but once you learn the important parts it all starts to get much better. \n\n&gt; 6) Other minor nitpicks that are mostly about personal preference. I don't like the undo model, I think its too complex and the added complexity doesn't justify the added power. \n\nWhat don't you like about it? u undoes stuff, `&lt;C-r&gt;` is redo - the keys are different but it's just like every other editor in that regard. I would argue it's better in some ways though, as it doesn't guess where to put the undo checkpoints. The places where undo reverts to are perfectly deterministic, which is extremely important in Vim. \n\n&gt; And I don't like how almost everything you do changes the clipboard\/buffer, and when I paste, the text that appears is almost never what I expect. (I often copy something with the intent of pasting it in 20-30 seconds, then do a bunch of other edits before pasting)\n\nThis is just a change you're going to have to get used to - if you want to save something you can easily put it in a named buffer, or take advantage of the number buffers, or quickly open a scratch buffer with something like `:vnew` and store it there, or something like that. If you want, you can make some bindings that make storing in a named buffer even faster, or that redirect certain types of deletions to the blackhole buffer so they don't mess with what you expect to be on the clipboard. \nDooey: Much of your argument hinges on the fact that vim can be good if customized, and my main argument is that an editor that is only good if customized is a bad editor. Another of your arguments is that vim is designed to be very general purpose. I can see how a specific purpose tool will be better than a general purpose one for that purpose, and the things I uses I have for a text editor for are fairly narrow (editing code exclusively, no html\/css\/config files\/stuff like that) however, the specific purpose tools I've used for editing code have _almost_ all the features of vim, and a ton of other features specific to that purpose.\n\n&gt; If you miss [ctrl+s to save], you can just add something like this to your vimrc\n\nIf, all else equal, by customization I can achieve parity with another editor, the other editor is better.\n\n&gt; The motivation for not using the arrow keys is that it takes your hand away from the home row.\n\nOn my keyboard, every laptop keyboard I've ever used, and a majority of desktop keyboards I've used, this is not true. I can very easily reach the arrow keys and the H key without any crazy hand contortions.\n\n&gt; Or you can jump straight there using \/ or ? to search for the words around the text you want to jump to. Or you can use the f or t commands to jump to a given character. Or you can jump to a location you've bookmarked. Or you can use {, }, [[ or ]] to navigate by paragraphs. Or a number of other options.\n\n[this](http:\/\/www.asktog.com\/TOI\/toi06KeyboardVMouse1.html) research indicates that people consistently overestimate the time it takes to use the mouse. As I said, it *feels* slower, but in many cases, it feels slower than it actually is, to the point where the gains from switching away from the mouse are minuscule, and sometimes the mouse is actually faster. The problem is that moving a mouse is _too_ easy, and your brain is bored while moving it. Using a shortcut is easy enough that it feels like muscle memory, but difficult enough that your brain is occupied, and this causes it to feel shorter, even when it takes longer.\n\n&gt; This is true, but like I was just saying, vim is not a tool designed for user-friendliness, it's designed for raw efficiency.\n\nThese are not mutually exclusive. A good editor will be both.\n\n&gt; What don't you like about [the undo system]?\n\nThe fact that it uses a tree instead of a linear system. With most editors, you use &lt;C-z&gt; to undo, and &lt;C-Z&gt; to redo. Only 2 commands, so its way easier to remember, and even better: follows the pattern of all shortcuts in good editors: if ctrl+key does something, then ctrl+shift+key does the \"opposite\" of that thing. (Opposite here is kind of vague but always makes sense in the context of each command)\n\n&gt; if you want to save something you can easily put it in a named buffer, or take advantage of the number buffers, or quickly open a scratch buffer with something like :vnew and store it there, or something like that.\n\nAgain, too much complexity for not enough benefit. 99% of the time I just want to copy and paste. The 1% of the time that I want to do something more complex with buffers, I can just open a new file and paste there temporarily, which, by the way, requires less keystrokes on Sublime Text than what your suggestion is: ctrl+n,v to open a new, unnamed file and paste there. 3 keystrokes. What is it for vim?","1549":"dodinator: I'm against independence for more 'wooly' reasons than you give, especially as economics isn't my strong point.

Why hasn't that happened?\nEmergencyTaco: The risk associated with all of the conspiracy theories is the one thing preventing me from ever going full-blown conspiracy theorist. I'm operating under the \"what if\" assumption. I'm really trying hard not to fall into the trap that a lot of conspiracy theorists find themselves in, and that is the trap of \"yeah, okay, but...\" What I mean by that is I don't ever want to come off as just discounting all pieces of evidence refuting my position while simultaneously just throwing up another theory.\n\nThat being said, I feel your response is based solely on the idea of \"it can't be true because no one has come forward yet.\" In terms of the stock market manipulation, I agree. It would have been incredibly risky and an obvious way of tracking down people involved. However, it still happened. I am absolutely not discounting the possibility of pure coincidence, but you have to admit it is a BIG coincidence. Perhaps the fact that it is just so obvious is enough to pull it off. Hide in plain sight and all that jazz. (Yeah I know that sounds like I'm grasping for straws, I'm just spitballing here.) I'd just like to know what else could potentially cause this.\n\nBefore I address the rest of your bullet points I want to say this: I don't think any of us have any idea exactly how powerful\/far reaching the government is. I agree, it would be RIDICULOUSLY difficult to keep all of this under wraps, but that's not to say it's beyond the US Government's capabilities. Look at the NSA for example. It has been around since 1917, and has been conducting mass surveillance on US citizens since 1981. I'm willing to bet that the Snowden-esque surveillance has been going on for quite a while, but it took over 30 years for this information to be leaked and there are THOUSANDS of NSA employees. 9\/11 only happened 14 years ago, and thousands of people would not have been needed to make this work. Again, just spitballing.\n\n&gt;Who did the work?  \n\nI don't know, and I'm not going to pretend to. Who is digging through people's personal files unconstitutionally or carrying out torture at Guantanamo? (Granted those aren't as significant as a large-scale attack on your own people.) There are hundreds of millions of people in this country, and while I'd like to believe there is a vast majority that would be appalled at the idea of propagating something like 9\/11, I'm also sure there's a number of people willing to look the other way for the right price.\n\n&gt; How were they able to wire 2 buildings with 110 floors each without anyone noticing? No fresh drywall or paint noticed. No security tapes. Nothing.\n\nI don't believe the Twin Towers were a controlled demolition. I believe two planes were hijacked and flown into the towers and the heat from the jet fuel fires weakened the steel supports enough so that they buckled, and then gravity did the rest. I am absolutely not a JET FUEL CAN'T MELT STEEL BEAMS conspiracy theorist. (And fun fact, burning magnesium IS hot enough to melt steel, and magnesium is a very common component in airplane wings.) I believe that WTC-7 may have been a controlled demolition. It came down seven hours after the Twin Towers and it started it's collapse from the bottom rather than the top. Seven hours amid complete chaos is enough time for an experienced team to plant charges and detonate them. \n\n&gt;What was the plan if something went wrong, as happens from time to time in demolitions? What if the plane just clipped the building?\n\nAgain, I don't believe the Twin Towers fell as a result of a controlled demolition. I believe they fell because two planes flew into them. (I think it's a possibility that Al-Qaeda could have been contacted and instructed on where we were weak and how they could exploit those weaknesses, but I definitely believe that the hijackings happened as stated. That doesn't mean the government wasn't involved in my opinion. Also, if it happened in this way it would be MUCH easier to cover up, you would really only need one person making a call from a payphone.)\n\n&gt; How many people would have been involved at each level? How much money would it take to keep EVERY SINGLE ONE of them quiet? Basically anyone involved would have enough proof to blow it wide open for, what would basically be the single biggest news story of all human history. Why hasn't that happened?\n\nHonestly, I don't think it would have to be that many. 50, maybe 100 at the very most. It could even be as low as 20. If it was a matter of the government instructing Al Qaeda on how to hijack a plane and where to fly that plane it may have only involved 2-3 people. (That's assuming there were no controlled demolitions.) A full scale attack like some of the conspiracy theorists out there like to imagine would have involved hundreds of people and probably would have been almost impossible to keep a secret. But a couple of phone calls and a small 10 man team of demolitions experts could potentially accomplish what I'm arguing. Why has no one come forwards? It could be fear that the government might kill them, it could be the fact that they're getting paid marvelously so they have more to lose by coming forwards or it could be a combination of the two. Not everyone is as righteous as Edward Snowden. A lot of people just look out for themselves. If each man on the supposed demolition crew is getting $10 million a year for him to keep his mouth shut then I can see them not coming forwards.\n\nThanks a ton for your response!","1469":"vethlock: I don't see anything wrong with something that is detrimental being socially accepted.

What I mean is, the choice not to have children almost always revolves around a person's current life situation and\/or what life situation they envision for themselves in the future. The decision is *about themselves* and therefore by definition selfish (self-ish).\n\nOf course, just because a decision is self-motivated doesn't automatically make it \"wrong\" or \"bad\". \nJashinist: But then, couldn't one argue the same for having children?

Whatever a child's response is to bullying, it isn't necessarily a conscious choice, but rather a result of how that kid was raised, or what kind of bullying they're encountering. In either case it's a traumatic event in someone's childhood that you're allowing to happen. Is bullying the only such trauma that can \"equip\" a child to handle the realities of adulthood? Surely I don't think you'd agree that a child should be beaten regularly to make sure they're ready for the life ahead of them.

Relevant enough that terms like 'Big Brother' for a surveillance apparatus are commonly used.

He stops by the door of a weird woman who's seduces him despite him being a silly Jew.  He lives with her. She's very creepy.  He gets more distant from his Judaism and then she tries to kill him with the knife he sold her.  He realizes and gets closer to God and moves on From her.  It's a holocaust metaphor.  He is the Jews, she is Europe.) what makes this any more literature then 1984? I'd gladly learn 1984. It's actually one of the few books I've read completely on my own.  But we are taught the same, stupid stories. They all seem to be somewhat related to the holocaust, in some weird ass town in fucking eastern Europe about a rabbi who moved to Israel or some shit like that.

It is historically commonplace that small businesses are the ones which suffer when market-shifting technologies come on-line because *what makes a technology market shifting is the dramatic increase in productivity it allows* , and small businesses, on the whole, are much less likely to have access to the capital needed to implement these game-changers early on.\n\nWhat I'm going to argue with, in compliance with comment rule #1, is this line \"thus they are basically being swindled. \"\n\nIt is not the sellers of high-yield enabling GMOs which are doing the swindling, if anything it is the market itself.

The message of the story was that swearing carries with it a significant emotional strength. Swearing is \"strong language\" because it's used only sparingly to express strong emotion or to reduce inflicted pain or stress.\n\nSo when swearing is used commonly, the strong feelings associated with it are lost, since no one is going to infer strong emotion from a word that's commonly used. If you (and society around you) swear a lot from the minor inconveniences, what language would you use if you experienced tremendous injustice and felt significant rage and inner pain?\n\nWhat's this have to do with kids? We want to encourage kids to have an expansive vocabulary so that they can adequately express themselves and convey their thoughts and feelings. Teaching a kid to swear is akin to giving the kid the trump card. Why should they learn or use broader language to understand or express their negative feelings when they can just complain about the fucking bitch who can't do shit?\n\nIn short, if you'd trust your children with ice cream in hopes that they'd eat it only in moderation (and in the context of a broader array of healthier foods), you could teach them swearing.

Most of our issues in the modern world are very multi-dimensional, and population is but a single factor. Pair that with the fact that [most people in the world live in some kind of poverty](http:\/\/www.globalissues.org\/article\/26\/poverty-facts-and-stats), and the[ global population trend shows that there's more people in underdeveloped nations than first world countries](http:\/\/www.prb.org\/Publications\/Datasheets\/2012\/world-population-data-sheet\/fact-sheet-world-population.aspx), and I don't think your solution would be the perfect answer you think it is. \n___\n#As direct responses to your categories, however:\n\n##Global Warming\/Ecological Impact:\n\nThe fact that most of the world is not highly developed shows that a lot of this pollution comes not from a bigger population, but from more developed regions with higher population density. There are plenty of ways to cut down on pollution without necessarily reducing population size. There are pushes for green energy, more efficient technologies, tighter regulations on corporate environmental practices, pushes for recycling, mass transit and carpooling, electric cars, etc... By reducing the population, you might potentially slow the rate of development, but the issue of global warming is a cumulative effect of emissions over time. We'd still have to deal with the environmental changes, but perhaps we'd have more time to deal with it. That's more a bandaid fix than a solution outright. \n\n##Global Energy\/Food Shortage:\n\nIn terms of energy production and food supplies... we actually aren't doing that bad in the world. The only issue is that [developed nations hoard their resources](http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2015\/jan\/19\/global-wealth-oxfam-inequality-davos-economic-summit-switzerland), leading to starvation in regions like Africa and much of Asia. There was a great post over on \/r\/theydidthemath; and an [amazing comment](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/theydidthemath\/comments\/2qzts1\/request_how_much_money_would_it_cost_the_citizens\/cnb3apd) which calculated that first world countries only make up about 12% of the population, and even still it would only cost us 9\u00a2 a day to end world hunger, or less than 5% of the United States annual military spending.\n\nFor the energy part of this equation, we already have limitless resources for power (e.g. the sun, hydroelectrics, wind farms, etc...) we just need more pushes to actually pursue this technology, which is not going to make OPEC happy, but they do not represent the best interests of humanity in the long term. \n\n##War:\n\nReducing population isn't going to end violence or war any time soon. We've had wars throughout the history of humanity, even when the distances were great between peoples. Population may increase the relative stress of resource distribution, but with how technology has offset that process, it really comes down to violence, diplomacy, and greed. And as above with the effects of global warming; we're going to use up our resources eventually. The issue is not to try and slow the bleed, it's to explore other options to keep our growth sustainable. Looking towards alternative materials, recycling, asteroid mining, etc...\n\n##Epidemic:\n\nWe're already pursuing herd immunity and we've been able to destroy diseases like small pox in the past. Despite what the crazy anti-vaxxers might try to tell you, vaccinations are protecting our population from outbreaks. That said, increased population is a concern, but only if the health standards are affected by this increase in population. If living in sanitary conditions, the number of people is less important that the treatment received for illness. And, with the interconnection of the world, while you may reduce the overall population, the requirement for corporations, businesses, and interaction would lead to greater contact overall. The greatest threat in terms of epidemic and pandemic really is transportation, and how these diseases can ride on ships, planes, and trains to spread themselves rapidly. Population is only one factor.\n\n##Psychological issues:\n\nWhile there may be some stress from living in a big city, I don't think you can attribute all mental health issues, or indeed most, just to population side. Setting aside the fact that there are plenty of extroverts who would thrive in a more populous region, those who are under stresses that lead to depression and other mental illness are often driven there not by the number of people around them, but by the societal pressures that population brings. Competing for jobs, dealing with negative advertisements and peer pressure, feeling threatened by certain people, trying to support ones self. It's more about quality than quantity. \nturboboob: Okay, those are all good points. I appreciate you not calling me crazy or a doomsday enthusiast. I get that a lot. \n\nTo address one point, I may have made the post title a little more clickbaity than I could have. I know population control isn't going to be a be-all end-all solution to large problems, but I do think it'll still be a good sign if we could collectively acknowledge that there's a problem that if it isn't here yet, is coming. \n\nAlright, down to the details!\n\n&gt;The fact that most of the world is not highly developed shows that a lot of this pollution comes not from a bigger population, but from more developed regions with higher population density.\n\nI guess I don't see the distinction between what I perceive as a large population and what was proven as a small population with areas of high density. The numbers are still the same, they're just arranged differently. \n\nIf we looked at NYC and took the population down 75%, there would still be less people requiring goods and services which would therefore require less transportation for delivery of those goods and services. By that logic, the average carbon footprint of the city would diminish over time. \n\nI understand that the damage that has been done has been done, and that moving forward there will need to be be adjustments both for the effects that have already taken place as well as efforts to reduce future impacts, but having a smaller population would allow for more time to to make those adjustments while minimizing the damage done during the transition to a more sustainable culture.\n\n&gt;The only issue is that developed nations hoard their resources, leading to starvation in regions like Africa and much of Asia. There was a great post over on \/r\/theydidthemath; and an amazing comment which calculated that first world countries only make up about 12% of the population, and even still it would only cost us 9\u00a2 a day to end world hunger, or less than 5% of the United States annual military spending.\n\nI may have just been taken in by the news on this one. It really seems like there has been a lot of coverage on shortages but really that can just be attributed to the hoarding of resources, which nobody reports on but most people know about. There's a reason that we can go to a grocery store in the US and have our pick of the goods while our counterparts in Somalia are fighting for a meal a day. I'll have to read that thread from \/r\/theydidthemath. \n\nI guess in the end if I wanted to stick to my guns on this topic, I could argue that if there were less people vying for the static number of resources, there would be a logical tipping point where hoarding would be more costly than sharing and those without could receive resources from those who have too much in order to keep the resources from going bad. But I think that was the basis for trickle down economics...haha so maybe not.\n\n&gt;violence, diplomacy, and greed.\nI'm struck by how these are all innate qualities in man that drive war. One other quality of man is the need to consume, where we use those three initial qualities to sustain the demand to consume. That leads me back to war and the need to consume a commodity that another group owns. \n\nThe problem I run into with my own train of thought here is that the only way to properly provide resources to all groups when the those resources are held by a singular group is the basis of socialism, which doesn't work for me. So I agree that war probably won't *end* since we've divvied up the world and it's assets already and we're not going to be dissolving borders anytime soon. I'm having trouble tying that one back to overpopulation, so I'll concede. \n\n&gt;increased population is a concern, but only if the health standards are affected by this increase in population. \n\nAlright, one I can REALLY dig into since I have firsthand experience! Increased population *is* without a doubt causing healthcare standards to stagnate if not recede. I've looked deeply into this topic, and I'm going to sketch out a line of events to follow: population growth --&gt; need for more production of goods and services to sustain quality of life for population --&gt; more hours worked resulting in the decline of general health of the population (think obesity from fast foods etc.) --&gt; greater strain on the healthcare system as unhealthy population ages --&gt; strain on actual healthcare workers in form of greater number of patients --&gt; more patients = lower level of care per patient. \n\nThe only reason I can argue this one is because I see it everyday. There is a definite shift towards in our population that's driven by those of us working longer hours at a sedentary job that doesn't allow for proper diet or exercise. My wife's a nurse and I'm getting my masters in public health and safety. We both see it everyday and it's terrifying. Couple my firsthand experience with the fact that insurance companies are now implementing wellness programs to reduce the costs they're paying out in claims because prevention is always cheaper than treatment and it's paints a pretty decent picture.\n\n&gt; And, with the interconnection of the world, while you may reduce the overall population, the requirement for corporations, businesses, and interaction would lead to greater contact overall. The greatest threat in terms of epidemic and pandemic really is transportation, and how these diseases can ride on ships, planes, and trains to spread themselves rapidly. Population is only one factor.\n\nFWIW I agree completely. The fact that we're so physically connectable now is something that even population control won't fix. Even with a smaller population the planes, trains and automobiles will still run.\n\n&gt;While there may be some stress from living in a big city, I don't think you can attribute all mental health issues, or indeed most, just to population side. \n\nAbsolutely not. I doubt that there are people who are actually becoming consciously depressed over population growth. It's the implications of it that help psychological issues present. I think that you were driving at in the second part of your response is exactly what I was saying: \n&gt;those who are under stresses that lead to depression and other mental illness are often driven there not by the number of people around them, but by the societal pressures that population brings. Competing for jobs, dealing with negative advertisements and peer pressure, feeling threatened by certain people, trying to support ones self. It's more about quality than quantity.\n\nIt's my opinion that all of those things that add to quality of life are threatened when the population reaches critical mass and that's what drives the psychological issues. If there's overpopulation in the city, there's fewer jobs. If there's fewer jobs, there's higher unemployment. If there's higher unemployment, there's a greater amount of household stress. If there's greater household stress, there's a greater chance of mental trauma leading to a psychological issue. \n\nI absolutely *raced* to respond, so if this is all incoherent rambling please don't think me unintelligent. I'm probably going to go in and revise some things and formatting after I reread.\n\n\n","5168":"n_5: Remember, the argument that mass piracy preserves things assumes that hundreds of years from now we'll have technology which can read in and play back the same files we're pirating today. It's all well and good if we have thousands of hard drives remaining 600 years from now, each with the entirety of the GoT universe (books, TV show, lore, you name it) stored on it. However, if there aren't any computers (or other devices) available to play them back to you, those hard drives are essentially useless. To put it another way, it's like [that scene from Zoolander](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=H2uHBhKTSe0) where they're trying to figure out how to access the files in the computer. If the files exist, then we technically have preserved them - but if we can't actually access them, then what's the point?\n\nPart of the reason cave paintings have survived so well is because they're entirely intelligible even without any other knowledge of human culture. Monks' manuscripts from the middle ages are similar, in that they've preserved materials in a language we understand - but what happens in a thousand years where someone who has no knowledge of the English or Latin or Italian (etc.) languages or any way to get that knowledge stumbles upon those manuscripts? They'll have the really old stuff in tactile, tangible form, but they won't be able to access any of the information on it. Hard drives would be even worse - if you can't get into them and see the files stored there, they serve no purpose other than really old paperweight.\n\nSo, to answer your question: Is home recording\/piracy an effective form of preservation? Sure. Is it the *most* effective, though? Absolutely not.

It adds something to their job, and once you're big enough to have an HR department you can't hope to be functional without one, so you may as well utilize your investment in it.\n\n2.) It takes time away from a person's ability to work, if they have to do interviews repeatedly. You have to consider that, on average you can't just interview a single person and call it good. You have to entertain multiple applicants, which means that over the course of a week you might pull 15 or more hours of Research and Development time away from a project so you can hire one person.

His paintings are technically valuable.  They focus intensely on color, shape, scale, balance, composition, depth and detail.  To put it simply, they're painted well (in the way artists are expected to paint), but you're right- to some extent, it's devoid of communicative purpose.  They're empty.  I think the expectation then is that a viewer would look at the painting, and fill in those gaps themselves.  It almost brings in the viewer as a complementary artist, as they can fill in the gaps intentionally left open by the artist.  \n\nFrom doing some research, I find some familiarity- he was heavily influenced by Nietzsche.  His painting style then starts to make some sense.  Nietzsche was interested in both the simultaneous power and emptiness of the human spirit- man, according to Nietzsche, has had its spirit subjugated through cultural forces, and he was interested in reinvigorating that spirit.  But this means a person becoming their own being, not becoming something that Nietzsche tells them to be.  Does that make sense?  An Ubermensch is someone who has power over his own spirit, and isn't bound by the influences of anyone else.\n\nI think this artist was trying to paint something that had all the technical value of a painting, but wanted to leave it empty of any culture, message, or meaning.  He's not interested in telling people the meaning of something, he's interested in forcing the spirit to acknowledge nothingness and fill in the gaps with its own being.  \n\nThis is all very abstract, but think what happens when you look at the painting.  Your first reaction is to try and understand, why?  Why did he paint this?  What's he trying to say?  What's the point?  I think the artist wants you to reach the conclusion that he didn't have a message to send you.  But we as human beings seek meaning in our experiences, so now the internal push we feel is us trying to fill in the gaps with our own meaning and understanding.\n\nEver hear a description of silence being loud?  This is because silence forces us to acknowledge that silence, and that can be a really uncomfortable, but enlightening, experience.  I think this is similar- it's forcing us to acknowledge the silence of the painting, which makes us uncomfortable the same way silence does.  \n\nEdit: There's a really great Nietzsche quote that summarizes these paintings: \"When you look long enough into the void, the void begins to look back through you.\"  The artist is confronting us with a void- and at some point, that void starts to stare back into us as well. \nMainstay17: \u2206\n\nMy original reply to this seems to have disappeared, which is odd, but this has indeed changed my view on the subject.

For instance I met a member of an accounting firm (I'm an accounting major) at a baseball game and got offered an interview. There was also a \"meet the firms\" night at a restaurant near campus that I accidentally stumbled upon and met many job prospects there.\nAlso, during my internship, we participated in some outdoor activities after work, like playing kickball with the employees, which helped you meet other people at your firm and helped make a good impression. \n\nMy point is that you can't always rely on covering up a tattoo because sometimes you run into job opportunities or situations unexpectedly. Of course this only really applies if your tattoo is obscene or offensive, because most employers could care less if you have a tattoo as long as it isn't like, on your face or something.\nKtrayne: \u2206 to you because I didn't consider the fact that besides the interview process there are other places I would meet an employer prior to being employed.

Most people who are complaining about failing to find jobs go for things they love, yet struggle to find jobs for it. \n\nSo, for example, Philosophy has a 9.3% unemployment rate, while Chemical Engineering has a 2.2% unemployment rate [(source)](http:\/\/www.studentsreview.com\/unemployment_by_major.php3?sort=Rate).\n\nUnfortunately, what someone *wants* to do and what is economically useful doesn't always line up. There are more philosophy majors than there are jobs for philosophy. Most businesses aren't too excited about hiring philosophy majors. Yet, for more tech-oriented fields, the demand has never been higher. And when we look as a whole, rather than just at one field, Bureau of Labor Statistics data show that *48% of college grads are in jobs that don't use their degree!* [(source)](http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/susanadams\/2013\/05\/28\/half-of-college-grads-are-working-jobs-that-dont-require-a-degree\/) \n\nSo, with regards to tech fields, you may be right, but for ALL college graduates, because too many of them go into fields with a very low demand, they have a very hard time finding a good job.\nnot_that_abused: I don't disagree with you, but I have some issues with complaining about being unemployed while pursuing a field with high unemployment.  If someone has a dream and wants to pursue it full time, I am happy for that person.  However, dreams must be put in realistic terms.  That is to say, someone who wants to study philosophy should be aware that the positions are limited and adjust their expectations accordingly.  This is where I see pragmatism meeting idealism.  Just like if someone wants to be an actor in Hollywood, spending ten years waiting for it to work out is not unexpected.\n\nI feel like there are many paths to success, and not all of them involve chasing your dream directly.  Learning life skills through pursuing a career in one field can give you the ability and the capital to succeed in another field later on.  What I hate is the idea of wasted potential, where people pursue very limited opportunities unsuccessfully for long periods and waste opportunities for growth in other ways.  There are stigmas to getting a job outside of one's dream path, but having money and learning skills for success can create a foundation later on if the initial attempts at one's dream do not work out.","2548":"CANOODLING_SOCIOPATH: First off I have to admit that I have a huge bias.

Like any game, the most important part of it is the enjoyment you get from it - be it grinding for hours on end, blasting through and skipping all the sidequests, or anything in between.\n\nYou aren't a professional gamer.

I think my frustration with these RPGs is knowing that I *could* play them \"correctly\" but don't want to put in the effort.\n\nBut you (and the others) are right - I'm playing for me, so whatever maximizes my enjoyment is the important thing.  \u2206","3079":"[deleted]: You have every right to compare yourself to others, it's what we do.

This would be an unproductive thing because this fosters resentment and agitation for one thing. It wouldn't help me with my relationship to my brother, it would only damage it. \n\nAnd seeing to compare yourself to find where you are is tantamount to asking people what they think of you. You know you at your most intimate and deepest level, through you conscious and experiences. If I have a 100K Salary and work at the 99th Floor at a Fortune 500 Company, I don't need to compare myself to Bob in Accounting to know where I am in the Company.\n\nI don't seek to compare myself to others all the time, except if I have good reason to do so. And comparing oneself to another can often times lead to judgement which may hinder your comparison. If so, I would compare myself many times to the \"Popular\" kids at school and wonder why I'm not so popular. I have good looks, get good grades, pretty sociable so where am I failing? But alas, I'm my own person.

However, I view the exploration of other things as inherently shameful. To offer a more vague example, say Characters A and B had a hinted romance, but later in the canon, it is explicitly shown that Characters A and C share a long-term romance together. It is strange for me to then experience: 1. Disappointment at Characters A and B not having a similar romance, 2.

However, the moment they see an opportunity, or the moment they become prevalent enough that simply returning them (*all* of them, at once) to public management on a relative moment's notice becomes impossible, it's quite literally their *job* to milk that opportunity for all it's worth.  When that happens, suddenly you start seeing regulatory \"reforms\" that look a lot like lowered standards, rating systems start to disappear or become stratified, and standards start to drift between public and private prisons....all things that, incidentally, seem to increase profitability while making it more and more costly and difficult to reinstate public control.\n\nIt's sort of like keeping an aggressive baby bear in your house on a dog leash.  Sure, it's safe so long as it stays the size it is and you don't get too close, noting to worry about really.

Equally I wonder what your objection would be to an ecosystem collapse (bad ramifications leading to suffering?). If it is a concern that ultimately is a moral, suffering argument, I would hope that the prevention of hunting would outweigh the collapse in terms of pain, but it would be hard to be sure. (sorry if I've completely skewed the argument!)\nAs for the second point, just because we are animals does not mean we cannot raise ourselves above them.

For instance, you seem to have an enormous amount of faith in inductive reasoning. If pressed, however, I am confident you would not be able to justify why you have faith in inductive reasoning without resorting to more inductive reasoning. Nevertheless you have faith in this form of epistemology.\n\nAnother thing you appear to have faith in is some form of non-relative ethics. You suggest that certain other values are a benefit to those around them. What does it mean to be a benefit to others? Presumably you have something of a fixed understanding of what behaviors are beneficial if you are asserting that there is a positive correlation between value x and benefit y. This is also a based in faith. If pressed you would almost certainly be unable to justify your faith in this specific ethical system without recourse to tautologies.\n\nFaith is an inevitable part of epistemology. All of our \"rational\" or deductive reasoning rests on the basis of starting assumptions, which at their very core amount to arguments taken on faith. You might imagine you could use something like Occam's Razor to justify having the fewest and least expansive assumptions possible, but essentially there is no way to escape the fact that all of your beliefs are built off of first principles taken on faith.\n\nPossumMan93: I hope you don't think that I'm arguing that I have never utilized faith throughout my life or even that I don't believe faith exists. You are absolutely right that I utilize faith in inductive reasoning, and it's efficacy and obtaining a desired outcome for myself and others. And you are absolutely right that I have faith in the belief that an ethical system in which \"good actions\" are those that duly benefit those around you, and \"bad actions\" are those that unduly harm those around you.\n\nBut you're not really addressing my concern. I don't believe that faith should be something to strive for. I don't think we should stop at \"I believe that inductive reasoning is the best way to go about solving problems and I don't need any other reasons to believe so\" I think we should be constantly striving to overcome reliance on faith. I don't think faith should be something to be proud of. I am not proud of the fact that faith is the only thing I can use to back up my reliance on inductive reasoning and I don't think anyone should be. I think we should be constantly looking to find a better way to justify it's use (if it's efficacy is not already enough).\n\nAnd by the way, my claim that inductive reasoning is the best way to solve problems is not based solely on faith. I'm not just saying \"inductive reasoning is the best way to solve problems because I believe so,\" I'm using verifiable evidence collected throughout my entire life. I reasoned, based on my experiences, that drinking water will quench my thirst feeling whenever I have it. And every time it works. That problem gets solved by inductive reasoning.

I'm sure you'll say that I can't know for sure whether it will continue to work, and you're right I can't, but I have *mountains* of evidence that it has worked in the past, *mountains* of evidence that not using it in the past has lead to problems, and doing nothing is not an option, so I'll continue to use it in the future, and if things turn out differently in the future than they have in the past I will alter my views.","2605":"BenIncognito: When African Americans started converting to Islam, there was a strong anti-establishment sentiment among those who did so.

","4910":"PrefersDigg: A few pros for oranges:\n\n- Easier to travel with. Throw an orange into a dirty bag, the part you eat stays clean. Don't have a plate to put it on? The peel suffices.\n\n- An orange is cleaner to eat. Both because of the peel, and because it naturally segments. Very hard to eat an apple without getting sticky juice all over you. I hate the feeling of sticky face and hands after eating an apple.\n\n- Hard to make an argument about taste as preferences differ, but personally I find apples pretty boring. Citrus is more interesting to me.\n\nTo a few of your points:\n\n&gt; Alcohol\n\nNot really a pro for apples themselves. There are also orange liqueurs. I'd say that apples are used for alcohol more for convenience historically, and now tradition, rather than any inherent advantage. Somewhere in Africa there is liquor made by the tribe's women all chewing up some plant matter and spitting it into a big pot to ferment (really, I swear, I saw it on an odd food show). That's not really a benefit to spit.\n\n&gt; Food\n\nAn orange pie seems possible, it's just that other citrus works slightly better for it (key lime pie...) \n\n&gt; Diversity\n\nPerhaps the original form of the orange is better to begin with, so there's less need to create many variations. Also, if wide variations are allowed, I'd get to include many other types of citrus as benefits to oranges. A lemon, lime, grapefruit, pomelo etc are likely about as similar to oranges as the many breeds of apples are to each other, right? (cue biologist to tell me how wrong we are)\n\n&gt; Pop culture\n\nApple benefited from a recognizable icon, but given their neat technology, probably could have been just as successful as \"orange.\" Unfortunately that wouldn't roll off the tongue quite so well, and the Macintosh pun would be lost... But blame whoever wrote the dictionary, not the noble orange.\nkeanex: 1: travel - I don't see an advantage here for either. I wouldn't put either in a compromising situation to get dirty and if my hands are dirty from hiking then an apple is easier to ear without getting dirt on the actual fruit.\n\n2: mess - I personally find oranges to be much juicier and prone to dripping, my personal experiences don't match up to yours.\n\n3: taste - I prefer citrus in some cases, but the acidity can lead to palate fatigue much quicker than a variety of a sweeter apple like a Fiji Apple.\n\n4: alcohol - apples are used for making wine and cider because they have enough sugar to ferment a liquid down to a decent alcohol level while having a wide variety of apples to mix and developed a cider for many different palates. Apples are also available in a variety of liquers, apple brandy for instance, with a much larger variety of apple based liquors that serve as a main beverage. Orange liquers tend to not be drank straight, with some exceptions. As an aside, look up chi cha.\n\n5: food - even if there were common orange pies other citrus, lemon\/lime, already do a great job at that. Apple pie can also be enjoyed hot or room temp! I also forgot apple sauce, that stuff is awesome.\n\n6: diversity - the variety of apples you see as a weakness, but I see it as a strength to evolve!

A major reason to keep teaching children how to write legibly is because it helps improve basic motor skills like hand-eye coordination. \n\nConstantly writing actually made me a better speller, too.

However for China to succeed in the future it needs to modernize and focus on growing the domestic market by empowering its consumers.\n\nYou talked about granting more property rights to farmers\/rural folk which is good, the government also decided to deregulate some investment vehicles (because quite frankly all those ghost towns are embarrassing), strengthen social security and create a more independent judiciary (as an aside: does that sound very technocratic to you?).

Nor was there any serious discussion of reforming a financial system badly in need of more commercially oriented banks and liberalization. The fact is that Xi has dodged, at least so far, most of the reforms that require the political will to take on entrenched interests in the public sector. \u201cThe leaders still seem to emphasize stability over decisive actions,\u201d wrote BofA Merrill Lynch strategist David Cui. \u201cThis has strengthened our opinion that many of the tough reforms\u2026may prove difficult to implement.\u201d\n\nThey also refused to talk about government debt has practically doubled over the last 4 years. \n\nMy point is this. To compete with the USA and Europe, China needs to modernize, this is incredibly difficult to do because of the technocratic system, tendency to promote unity instead of innovation and rampant corruption (compare: http:\/\/cpi.transparency.org\/cpi2012\/results\/).

So if a woman wants to enter a male dominated field, there's a good chance she's going to have to be **more** qualified than a man. Positive discrimination is intended to get (in this case) women accepted when they are \"merely\" equally qualified. \n\n&gt; They don't solve the real issue, which is the discrimination that would have stopped the women from getting the job. They may be able to overcome it thanks to external help, but even if we have solved the symptoms the problem is still there. \n\nAnd as soon as we have good, viable way to stop the discrimination from happening at all, we should implement that.

It used to be that engineers ran the place. They made cool stuff and gave it away for cheap, because Google's search engine made so much money that they could afford to try out random stuff.\n\nNow as the company is older, they had to start promoting those engineers to management positions, and not all of them took to their new roles very well. On top of that, Google started hiring a lot more consulting\/banking business types. They are starting to expect returns on their investments on their fun stuff, and are finding ways to squeeze every dollar out of their ads. Finally, many of the truly creative developer types are leaving\/have left to get involved with new start-ups. As a result, the culture has started to seriously decline.\n\nA good example is the recent fiasco with Youtube. In the guise of improving the site, they put in more ads, reduced the download speeds, and forced people to sign up for their failed Google+ product to register for the site. You can tell that those decisions were made by executive types rather than engineers that are truly trying to make the best experience for their users. This isn't really Google's fault. It happens to all companies. Remember that Microsoft was the most prestigious\/profitable\/innovative company in the world for a while too.\n\nSo Google is pretty good, but they are on the decline.

The \"job\" of the armed forces, homeland security, etc. is to protect *American* lives.  That's what their mission is, that's what they are paid to do.  The inequality isn't viewed by the actors as a moral justification.  They don't get paid to mitigate losses to other countries citizens or make moral determinations about the value of life.  An American life is \"worth\" more because America spends more money to protect it.  If the conflict country did \/ could spend as much; fewer of their civilians would die.\n\nForeign citizens die more often because they don't have sufficient advocates internal to our system or sufficient advocacy from their governments.

Chicken, for example, has a much lower carbon footprint as a result of production.  They require less feed, they cost less to transport, and they emit less as animals.\n\nHere's a possibly credible thing that I just found on the internet:\nhttp:\/\/shrinkthatfootprint.com\/food-carbon-footprint-diet\n\nAs you can see there, a \"no beef\" diet is scarcely more impactful than a vegetarian diet, as meats that aren't beef are fairly carbon-friendly.  Obviously a vegetarian diet isn't carbon-free, as it still takes a great deal to farm and transport all of those vegetables.  It's really livestock that's so inefficient.\n\nAs to eggs and dairy, again these are fairly low compared to the consumption of beef.  A single cow can produce thousands of gallons of milk over her life, compared to the one-off steak frenzy that we get from slaughtering one.  And chickens (again very low carbon footprint) can pump out many times their weight in eggs with fairly little impact on the environment.\n\nif you truly want to help out the environment, I believe you could make a bigger difference by always eating locally-produced food, thus greatly reducing the transportation footprint.\n\nAs to the cruelty aspect, that's up to your own personal opinion.  Personally, the concept of getting milk and eggs from animals does not bother me, since both of these things are produced with or without our interference, and aren't causing additional harm to the animal.\nseriyes: Thanks for your well-reasoned response. That's the same article I linked to in my post. :) First google result for both of us I guess.\n\n\nI guess I came to a different conclusion than you after reading the article. While the reduction in carbon emissions from a normal diet to a beef-free diet is largest, the further reductions when continuing to vegetarian and vegan diets are by no means insignificant.\n\n\nWhile you are mostly right about milk, cheese has a massive carbon footprint and the impact from eggs is relatively large as well. Relevant article: http:\/\/www.ewg.org\/meateatersguide\/a-meat-eaters-guide-to-climate-change-health-what-you-eat-matters\/climate-and-environmental-impacts\/\n\n\nI agree wholeheartedly about buying local produce and food.

Even tobacco, the second most ingrained thing in Western culture, only goes back about 2-300 years.\n\nBut I disagree that you are an outcast if you don't drink; I understand that it feels like this now. These are long-term friends who you've known for a good portion of your life. But at that age, a lot of people develop contradictory interests. I had a few friends then who I had known since I was 9 or 10. We don't talk anymore, and I'm 27. And it hurt at the time. But time heals. And I realized that I didn't want to be the friend of this person, I wanted to be the friend of someone who didn't exist, to be friends with a phantom. As of today, I am the only person in my closest group of friends who drinks even fairly often. Of the 6 other people, 4 don't drink at all, and 1 drinks very rarely, closer to being completely sober. To be fair, 2 of those are under the drinking age, but still.\n\nAlso, I don't want to sound like I'm trying to convince you, but when I was 18, I hated the taste of alcohol. Beer was disgusting and hard liquor was awful. Then I found particularly fruity cocktails. Then, as I aged, I found those too sweet. A few months after I stopped with cocktails, I was at a business function where people were drinking beer, and the CEO handed me a beer. I figured that you don't not drink a beer your CEO hands you, so I drank it, and found that it wasn't as repulsive as I once found it.\n\nI also understand the revulsion towards heavy drinking culture. I had it too, and (oh god I can't believe I'm saying this) when I was your age, I swore I'd never drink. And then I started career building, and I realized that after a certain point (and I can't point to the exact moment), you aren't seeing a bunch of people who just hit the drinking age going hard-bodied, you end up finding people who drink occasionally and socially, and not to excess. Today, I don't drink often, but every month or so, I will go out with some co-workers for happy hour and have a few beers, or a couple margaritas, or whatever.\nSheinar: Your point about the religious significance of alcohol is something I hadn't actually considered when writing my original post. I'm not one to go against religions, I'd rather not tangle with that :P and you're very right that many religions have it deeply ingrained. And the idea of harmful bacteria not growing in it is a really interesting point I hadn't considered either.\n\nBut I don't think that really explains why (well, it explains why, but doesn't explain why we haven't rebelled against it) the \"drinking culture\" of binge drinking, going out to \"get smashed\" and that is so acceptable in our society. Maybe that's just my particular age group, but I feel that everywhere I go in the 'social-scape' of my age group, it revolves around alcohol at every turn, to the point where people specifically make events just to get drunk.\n\nYou raise some good points, and I know I didn't really make it that clear in my original post, but I don't really have any issue with people having a drink or two when hanging out with their friends socially. I don't have any issue with people using drugs in their own privacy either. It's the fact that the more dangerous (to the person, and the people around them) levels of drinking are socially acceptable. The wish I talked about in my post is for it to be looked down upon to be done in the public capacity it is now, like Marijuana is, where it's unacceptable to be stoned in public, but fine to do so where you don't affect other people.","5310":"scottevil110: &gt; I feel that posting armed guards at schools would directly deincentivize any individual from going to violent crimes at schools.\n\nNot if the person has no intention of staying alive throughout the ordeal. \n\n&gt; And if the individual wanting to commit is suicidal than the armed guards would directly solve the problem and stop the would-be gunmen before the tragedy even starts.\n\nHow do you figure?

Is it possible that if you put all that in one side of the balance, it outweighs the risk of death? To my mind yes.

I think the best way to incentivize would be to remove or reduce the minimum wage. If someone knows that they can't live based on their pay from a fast-food joint then they'll have even more incentive to get an education and a better job.\n\nI live in the USA, so I'll focus my argument there.\n\nPeople who have minimum wage jobs aren't there because they're lazy. \nEducation is expensive. Obtaining skill and obtaining education, therefore, requires either help from someone who does have the money, or a way to earn the money by yourself. Normally, the parents of college-age people are expected to pay or to help, but with the crap economy, that can't happen the way it used to happen. \n\nSo you have a whole generation of people who are left to pay for college nearly entirely by themselves, in a time when wages are low and costs are high. Put simply, low-skill jobs pay so little that it's almost impossible to go to school full-time. Therefore, people are taking longer and longer to enter the workforce at a high level, and are spending more and more time in low-wage jobs. In the meantime, they're paying for part-time school, they're paying for housing, for food, for bills, for the costs of owning a car... and frankly, you cannot expect them not to have a social life until they're well-established in a job after four to to seven years of education--they wouldn't have a life until they're 40, which precludes a lot of family-starting. \n\nIn essence, the longer you wait to get an education, the more bills you'll end up accumulating, and that's unavoidable. In addition, the lower your wage, the longer you'll have to wait to get your education. Following that, the lower your wage, the longer you'll need to stay in a low-wage position. \n\nIt's a vicious cycle--low wages lead to lack of opportunity, which leads to low wages. Reducing or eliminating the minimum wage will only make that *worse,* not better.\n\nWhile yeah, there's probably a percentage of people who have the opportunity and are just too lazy, that doesn't describe most people who just *can't* get a better education. Giving them incentives to move upward won't work when they already have all the incentive they need, but no opportunity to do so.\nMyNameDontAsk: &amp;#8710; I overlooked the fact that it education is expensive and by dropping the minimum wage it will only get harder.

The history of an oppressor using their position of power to oppress on the basis of a small characteristic is what makes racism racism.\n\nif this history wasn't involved, and people simply used race as a way to describe people (even if poorly), no one would care about racism. If it wasn't used to degrade, it would just be a form of random classification, not racism.\n\nSo in the case of someone from an oppressed class stating that they can not be racist, they recognize that their status as an oppressed class means that they do not have the power to oppress in the way someone from a powerful class would. and to someone from the oppressed class, the concept of racism is not just about classifying by race, but about classifying by race with the intent to oppress. since the oppressed can't systematically oppresses the powerful, they can't be reverse racist in the true sense of the term racist.\n\nkezzic: This is what I'm getting at, and what I don't understand. Why is there this underlying influence of the term \"oppression\" on the definition? Racism is degrading, yes, and can most definitely be harmful if used by an oppressor. But what makes being a minority and the use of racism mutually exclusive? In the example I gave from \/r\/nottheonion, the subject was denying white males access to a social activist meeting.\n\n\nYou are lumping the term oppression into the definition of racism, and that's where we are disagreeing. Yes, the two can both exist, but in some cases I feel like they can exist without one another. In the example, a minority was discriminating against another race, and prohibiting social cooperation from an entire demographic. I understand that the magnitude between this example and black oppression as a whole is distinctly different, but I feel like this is a prime example of racism\/predjudice\/discrimination on behalf of a minority.\n\n\nIn this instance, I see this as racist, but I don't see it as oppressive, because it doesn't carry as much weight as a racist societal\/political system would be.

If the dog approaches the fence, a warning tone sounds and we tug the dog back away from the fence line, reminding her that this is a no-go zone. She associates the flags, the tone, the tug, and our commands as a reminder that she can't go there.\n\nThe final step in training is to remove the traditional leash and use only the shock collar. If the unleashed dog continues toward the fence, the familiar tone sounds and the dog is reminded to move back.\n\nIf, however, some temptation is too great and the dog continues toward the fence line despite the warning tone, a brief shock is delivered. The dog then scampers back to us for comfort and reassurance.\n\nOnce we're sure the dog understands the relationship of the property line, the tone, the shock, and the no-go status, we removed the flags gradually: first every third one, then a few more, then a few more until they are all gone. The lesson, however, remains.\n\nOur current dog has received exactly ONE shock so far in her entire life, and this was during the final stage of training. In exchange for this ONE shock, she has been completely free in our yard her whole life, and she unfailingly respects our property line as though it were a concrete wall. She's safe from road hazards or from running away, but she runs, jumps, and explores our whole property to her heart's content.\n\nWe think this is a humane way to cope with the conflicting needs of living with a companion animal in a world full of arbitrary property lines and road hazards.\nMacDHD: I completely understand the training method you have employed. This behavioural reinforcement method is effective.\n\nThe one problem I have is when you say \"The dog then scampers back to us for comfort and reassurance.\" This says to me the dog is scared and confused. I don't believe the shock is enough to debilitate the animal but It clearly causes stress.\n\nI appreciate that this is a counter measure due to rules put in place but surely there are ways to reinforce the idea of the boundary without doing this?","2409":"DickButtSlamson: The idea of corporate tax cuts isn't necessarily intended to help the business directly. The ecconomic liberation that it brings to the upper class is supposed to \"trickle down\" to everyone else.The idea of trickle-down economics was used to much success during [Reagan's](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Reaganomics) administration. The basic idea is not that cutting taxes will create jobs. The idea is that the wealthy will be able to invest more; It's not necessarily about the business itself. It's kind of an abstract concept and I'm not explaining it too well. If we make the top class more successful, they won't have to be as frugal, per-say. They can take their profits and invest them rather than hoard their heavily-taxed income. The aid is not intended to go directly into the company, but rather trickle down.\n\nTo me, the idea of cutting taxes on big business is not really about helping that business directly, but rather increase economic freedom to allow the surplus to trickle down. It worked well for Reagan's years even with his enormous Cold War spending, although I'm ill-equipped to argue that it'd work for us now.\nWildlifeAndrew: &amp;#8710; I knew I had to be missing something. This does make at least a little sense. But then I have to ask, what if instead of providing tax cuts to a corporation and wait for it to trickle down, we take that money and directly provide it to people in need? In theory, they are going to take that money and spend it on things like food\/clothes, pay off loans\/credit cards, or in some unfortunate cases take adavantage of it and waste it on something they don't need. Even if all it does is end up in a savings account at a bank, the money still ends up going to corporations (potentially faster than a tax cut might actually be able to). At that point, the trickle down effect can occur and help everyone, but in the meantime, some direct assistance was provided to the people that needed it most, potentially easing their situation to the point where they need less assistance in the future.","5048":"KuulGryphun: &gt; If the definition of \"cis\" is basically people acting within the confines of their gender, why can't they just be called women and men?\n\nBecause the terms \"woman\" and \"man\" got overloaded.

The first one is nuanced, but the second one is what I consider the absolute fundamental rule for any road occupant to follow.\n\n1. Road size: Living in a fairly dense urban area, the physical size of the road is often not conducive to a cyclist (or a motorist for that matter) being able to always be more than a door length away from all parked cars while still being a safe distance from oncoming traffic. On most of the roads on my daily commute, riding in the exact center of my direction lane still puts me in danger of coming in contact with an open door. \n\n2. Responsibility of driver to ensure safety when changing the status quo of the road: Anytime a road occupant does something to make a change in their movement pattern, it is *always* their responsibility to ensure the action is safe, *not* the responsibility of other drivers to adjust their movement pattern to accommodate. This is true whether it be a lane change, a left turn, proceeding through an intersection at a stop sign, or opening a door. When a driver opens his\/her door, *they* are *actively creating* a situation that could be dangerous to themselves, cyclists, and other motorists. As such, it most definitely is the responsibility of a driver to do a quick mirror check for any traffic before throwing their door open. It takes two seconds to do, and it could save both your car door and someone from serious injury.\nZanzaraEE: 1. I couldn't imagine a road being that thin and still allow bidirectional traffic. If you couldn't make the fit (safely) between oncoming traffic and the door lane, how could a car be expected to? \n\n2. That's a good point. However, I think a road occupant must first must ensure their movement pattern is safe, then we can worry about *changes* in movement pattern. I feel that riding next to parked cars is something fundamentally wrong with a cyclist's movement pattern that make it so that no reasonable driver can be expected to see them all the time.\nAlso, and not the strongest argument against you: it is not *always* the responsibility of someone to making a change in movement pattern to ensure that said change in movement pattern is safe. Someone can slam on the brakes and it is not their responsibility at all if the person behind them was following too closely and rear-ends them. So sometimes we say \"Person A is free to make *blank* change in movement and Person B needs to drive\/ride in a fashion that ensures they can do so safely at any time.\"\n\n&gt; quick mirror check\n\ngiven the speed of cyclists and the manner that they sometimes dart around vehicles I do not believe this is always sufficient","3538":"joshh1727: The point isn't that there are plenty of followers of Islam who don't kill people. That is pretty much a smokescreen argument that people like Rezla Azlan and other PC liberals use to smear and misrepresent the true argument that people like Sam Harris and Bill Maher make.\n\nThere are good Muslims out there, most of them are, but they are good because they are moderates who don't take their religion literally. The ones who do take their religion literally have much more direct verses of violence, hatred and oppression they can look to to justify their hate. The Quran has [109](http:\/\/www.thereligionofpeace.com\/quran\/023-violence.htm) of verses that can turn one to violence. The Bible by comparison only has [one](https:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Deuteronomy%2013:6-10), and it is in a section of the bible that Christians don't strictly follow.\n\nI don't think pointing this out, and pointing out that places that operate under the laws of this book are more oppressive, violent, and sexist is bigoted at all. It's actually fair criticism. What is dangerous however is what people who cry \"islamophobe\" are doing because by saying that fair criticism is bigotry, they are censoring it, and letting these disgusting human rights violations continue. \nFabricatedByMan: The Bible, from my reading of it, seems abhorrent has far as violence is concerned.\n\nYou are correct that many theocracies based off of Sharia law are abhorrent. The same could be said of the female castrating African countries who are majority Christian.\n\nA spade should be called a spade. But damning an entire religion because of some people's interpretation of a young religion that hasn't had time to develop like Christianity and Judaism has, doesn't seem entirely fair.\n\nI believe Indonesia is a great example of a country with an Islamic majority where polls show very few Muslims there think that the penalty for apostasy should be death. I think the answer isn't yelling about how terrible Islam is, which I do think it is terrible, but education.\n\nIf we can teach religious people why child genital mutilation is bad and make them question their family's religion, I think Islam will be forced to adapt, as the other religions have.\n\nI see this as a problem of education, not of theology.","220":"anotherdean: The \"long run\" doesn't exist. It's an expanse of time in which nothing will be around to experience anything, and \"mattering\" is a function of the capacity of beings to value conscious experience. You might imagine a bleak universe experiencing heat death and feel that everything you've ever done has never mattered, but that's an experience that will only ever be had by you, right now, as you imagine it.\n\nNothing is going to be around to see everything \"cease to matter,\" which effectively means that there's a significant problem with the notion that \"mattering\" is dependent on the infinitely continuing experience of conscious creatures.\n\nThat said, what matters only occurs in the span of individual consciousnesses and personal preferences. The sort of mattering you're talking about is really your subjective feeling about the worth of the whole of human experience. In that sense, maybe it's true that you'll never feel that anything has mattered. But maybe you're depressed and this is just your subjective feeling.\n\nMaybe lots of things are mattering all the time, presently, for a lot of people, and that's the only way mattering can occur. Maybe civilization, plumbing, electricity, and civil rights are all worthwhile goals and successes of humanity. Maybe it's entirely a function of your perspective.\neffervescence1: Thanks for the thoughtful reply. I read through your post several times in order to best understand it. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems that the basic premise of your argument is that living beings can bestow significance upon experiences, which makes those experiences matter. Therefore, if humans consider civilization, civil rights, or anything else important, they make that thing matter.\n\nThat's an interesting view, but it seems to me that you've failed to fundamentally challenge my position. Your post has just altered the definition of 'mattering,' so that humans have the ability to make something matter. Of course I've experienced that ability as well- I work hard towards getting good marks in school, and therefore, to me, good marks matter. I value my relationships with my friends, and so those relationships matter. \n\nThat's all fine and dandy, but it doesn't tackle the fundamental belief of existential nihilism, which is that life has no intrinsic meaning or purpose. I can convince myself that good marks or friends matter, without believing that my life has a real meaning to it. Those good marks or friends are just the most comfortable means to an inevitable end. \n\nAs for the second part of my post, I said that I believe nothing will matter in the long run. The examples you've cited - civilization, plumbing, electricity, etc. - only matter in the short term. You yourself admitted this by saying that \"what matters only occurs in the span of individual consciousnesses.\" Since what matters is limited to occuring during consciousness, anything that matters will ultimately lose its importance, when the consciousness that bestowed significance upon it dies. So while humans may be able to make electricity matter in the short term, we can't do that in the long term because we're limited by our inevitable death- both the death of our person and the death of our species. To re-iterate this point, it is possible for humans to bestow meaning upon something without that something 'mattering' in the long term. You support this by saying that \"mattering\" is limited to the existence of consciousness, and as consciousness will ultimately end, so too will anything's ''mattering.'' This actually supports my argument, as nothing can matter in the long term.","2205":"Mavericgamer: The problem that poor people have against rich people, is that while the poor person might be an asshole, and the rich person might be a dick, even in the worst case of both of those scenarios, it's the dick that fucks the asshole, and not the other way around.\n\nThat is to say: It isn't *you*, the rich person, that poor people are mad at. It is the system that benefits the rich people seemingly unjustly because they have money. I could launch into a long drawn-out economics discussion, but the short of it is that trickle-down economics isn't working and hasn't worked in a while; to paraphrase the new Pope (and I'm atheist, it's just a good quote): the promise was that the cup shall overflow, and and that the overflow shall nourish the needy, but the reality is that the cup keeps growing so that there is never any overflow.\n\nSo, seeing that nice car is a reminder that the poor are going to have to toil to get something half that nice when they're twice your age. And yeah, if you're a cool person, I can see how that would sting. But you have to realize, too, that to every poor person taking the bus, this sounds incredibly self-absorbed. \"I get a little bit of ill will because I can afford a sports car.\" is about as \"first world problem\" as it gets, man.\njohnsonysu: Very interesting points. Please do not take anything I say below personally:\n\nSo just because the dick *could* fuck the asshole, the dick is therefore condemned even if he had no intentions whatsoever of doing so? So in essence, in times of depression because most people now live poorly, the rich are therefore dicks for continually being able to live well because they *could*? \n\nI'll rephrase.\nSo lets say an asshole wants to be a dick so that he could also buy nice cars and homes, (c'mon, everybody wants to be rich), why is it that we aren't mad at them? Is it essentially *wrong* to want to provide more and to improve the quality of life of your family? And is it essentially *wrong* to improve the quality of life of your family if you already have the means? And if it isn't fundamentally wrong, then why are wealthy people being persecuted solely based on their wealth?\n\nI mean why does it matter that the rich person lives well? You focusing on condemning his wealth is NOT going to alleviate your situation. Otherwise shouldn't all people living in third world countries essentially *detest* everyone fortunate enough to live in first world countries? \n\nThe trickle-down economics is a terrible idea, yet people still inherently *expect* it to work. The inheritance ideology which it propagates is essentially why poor people (no offence meant at all, just for simplicity of argument) think that they simply just deserve better and thus think\/behave aggressively when they do not receive that they were promised? \n\nAlso aren't you just assuming that rich people were born in the cup? Perhaps they could have worked very hard to get there but just because they decide not to share their hard earned wealth, does not mean they are dicks. \n\nSo you are saying that I should expect unjust prejudice and should just learn to live with this bias because I benefit from other aspects of life since I am wealthy? I don't like being called a prick for being rich but because I can afford a sports car therefore I am self absorbed? How does one make a connection that a rich person is self absorbed because he does not like being called a prick just because he can afford a sports car. It's is like making the connection that a homeless person is self absorbed because he doesnt like people calling him useless because he pleads for money. Should I now feel compassionate towards those who call me pricks? I reminding them of their inability to purchase a better life with my sports car makes me a well-deserved prick? Heavens help me if I actually do make a mistake... I'd be devoured by criticism...?\n\nMy ambition is to leverage the wealth I earn in the future to better help those who are in financial needs and just desperately need an opportunity. Wouldn't be pissed on on a daily basis by poor people (again, just for simplicity of argument, NO OFFENCE MEANT) mean that I start having second thoughts on helping them because I just don't think they deserve it? I mean if third world countries start shit on us for donating too little or for not sharing more of our resources with them, wouldn't we be less inclined to give? \n\nThen again, does anyone truly *deserve* anything? I certainly do not believe that I *deserved* my car, but I was fortunate enough to be able to drive one. But then again, just because I drive one, and that I remind you of the fact that you don't have one, do you then *deserve* to also have one? And then lets say someone gives you that car you *deserve.* Should you then also *deserve* to be hated by those who are yet to receive theirs? By extension of this logic, shouldn't everyone just *deserve* a better life in general without working? And isn't this ideology essentially what Communism tried to encapsulate and manifest but failed?","131":"[deleted]: If the world wasn't threatening, it wouldn't be rude.

How is sex a special activity with respect to the importance of commitment?","3356":"slf1452: I would like to think that you are correct in your expectations of the Chief Technology Officer route. One important aspect to consider is the sheer amount of time you have to develop your career.\n\nIf you are trying to make your first million by age X, or be the youngest Y in the field of Z, then you don't But honestly, who cares?\n\nUnless you have an outrageously specific life goal in mind (like developing the cure for some disease, or going to Mars), then you really don't have to focus so intensely on the time component by itself.\n\nConsider the following scenario:\n\nYou view time as equal to money, so wasting your time is wasting your earning potential. This has prevented you from socializing, making friends, enjoying your existence. However, this mindset has also obscured potential opportunities for you that you may not normally be exposed to.\n\nYou may find that by traveling to Nicaragua on a vacation, it strikes you that you can develop an easy solution to some problem you see there. Or perhaps after having some beers with some people in a hostel in Germany, you realize that the your niche expertise in your field of technology is underrepresented in the German market, and your efforts there could advance your career at a faster pace than what you can find in America. These are just examples. The main point is that you have arbitrarily chosen one limited route, and done the cost\/benefit analysis on that choice alone, without taking the time to consider a wider array of options.\n\nCircling back to your time = money scenario, this expanded worldview allows you to retain your instilled sense of the value of time, but can show you that you are \"Wasting your time\" by only considering one life path, even if there are others that could lead to a higher earning potential and better enjoyment of life.\n\nAdditionally, ask anyone in the business world about how EVERYTHING works, and they will all tell you that personal connections are hugely important. By not making personal connections and not building social and professional networks, you are pigeonholing your career potential. You may have the Ph.D, but what happens when you are going up for a position against another reasonably qualified person whom the recruiter gets along with better? You will miss it.\n\nSo if you need to, you could actually recategorize your time spent socializing as \"job training\", because no one would argue that social skills are irrelevant in a leadership position. They are essential. So stop wasting your time and go have fun and socialize with people, you will need the skills later.\nRyien: You are so right. I did set my own imaginary timeline where I have to get my PhD by age X, and get this specific job by age Y. \n\nIt may also be that I have a high competition mindset compared to my peers and what family and others expect out of me. This external pressure must be the driving factor, not necessarily my mindset then.\n\nI did actually try focusing on socializing for professional development, but I was unable to balance it. I started socializing with a few new friends and got attached to the point of dropping all of my work to see them and hang out with them. Another factor is my parents consistently bugging me that every time I go out and hang out, I am spending money, and i feel guilty of this.\n\n&amp;#8710; ","2843":"childfree2014: Improving the weakest, slowest, nodes of network is not the most cost effective method for improving the entire network. Investing in network upgrades depends on the function of the nodes.\n\nTake the connection between Netflix and your local ISP. This may be the fastest connection but increasing usage results in the connection not meeting demand. So investing in upgrading ths connection may be the most cost effective upgrade.\n\nOther network connections, between credit card terminals and credit card processing, may be the slowest but don't need to be any faster and don't need to be improved since they serve their function.\nSolFreer: &amp;#8710; Sorry for the delay. You have definitely convinced me that my analogy is an over-simplification, because, yes, upgrading a slow-node that isn't actually a bottle-neck isn't effective.\n\n However, I would adjust my view now to say that if a slow node isn't being bottle-necked it's because it's in an effective 'dead zone' and we have an earlier bottle-neck preventing demand in this region (say the individual lives in a poor area with bad education), and what needs to happen is to upgrade this whole region, removing bottlenecks.\n\nSo, my view is essentially now that one needs to focus on upgrading the slowest 'zones' of the network and demand will follow. Bring education and services to the disadvantaged communities, bring jobs there and it will be an investment in that region that will pay off for the whole network.

Welcome!\n\nHave you ever watched [the episode of South Park](http:\/\/southpark.cc.com\/full-episodes\/s05e02-it-hits-the-fan) where everyone found it publicly acceptable to say \"shit\", and the result was everyone started saying it without a care? The message of the story was that swearing carries with it a significant emotional strength. Swearing is \"strong language\" because it's used only sparingly to express strong emotion or to reduce inflicted pain or stress.\n\nSo when swearing is used commonly, the strong feelings associated with it are lost, since no one is going to infer strong emotion from a word that's commonly used. If you (and society around you) swear a lot from the minor inconveniences, what language would you use if you experienced tremendous injustice and felt significant rage and inner pain?\n\nWhat's this have to do with kids? We want to encourage kids to have an expansive vocabulary so that they can adequately express themselves and convey their thoughts and feelings. Teaching a kid to swear is akin to giving the kid the trump card. Why should they learn or use broader language to understand or express their negative feelings when they can just complain about the fucking bitch who can't do shit?\n\nIn short, if you'd trust your children with ice cream in hopes that they'd eat it only in moderation (and in the context of a broader array of healthier foods), you could teach them swearing. Otherwise, give them time to understand moderation and the effects of language on others.\nKaleb1983: Wow.. that actually makes a lot of sense.

I'll show you effeminate!\" (Not that I think gays are effeminate, but that that was the stereotype).  \n\nI'm also enough that when I was young, when people would say, \"You know Bill?  I just found out that *he's gay*\" - they made sure to whisper the last word.  (Or giggle if they were assholes).  Being \"out\" just wasn't done.\n\nBut there were enclaves - Provincetown, Fire Island, San Francisco - where there were gay communities.  Instead of having to hide who you were, you could delight in your identity, surrounded by others like you.  And part of that was \"acting gay\", making sure that the midwestern tourists who stumbled in would be shocked that such godless behavior would be allowed.\n\nThings are a hell of a lot better than they were then, but I don't need to tell you there's still a long way to go.  Being flamboyant is just a way to revel in being what the bigots hate - to say, \"I'm going to be incredibly gay, and you're just going to have to deal with it because we're here to stay\".\n\nAgain, no value judgements about whether one way or the other is better, but I don't blame people for saying they are done with trying not to be noticed.\nEmperorDuck: I totally agree with you that communities like that are absolutely beneficial, despite the abundance of the stereotype, for inclusiveness, for having a place that doesn't tell you it's wrong.\n\nThat said, I still don't see how it's beneficial to be combative towards bigots like that.

The Day of Silence fails to address why bullying exists, and the environmental factors that lead kids to attack each other. \n\nPeer pressuring each other into being nice all the time doesn't get to the root of the problem; it doesn't keep his alcoholic father from beating him. It just removes an outlet for the bully's pent up anger.

Most of our issues in the modern world are very multi-dimensional, and population is but a single factor. Pair that with the fact that [most people in the world live in some kind of poverty](http:\/\/www.globalissues.org\/article\/26\/poverty-facts-and-stats), and the[ global population trend shows that there's more people in underdeveloped nations than first world countries](http:\/\/www.prb.org\/Publications\/Datasheets\/2012\/world-population-data-sheet\/fact-sheet-world-population.aspx), and I don't think your solution would be the perfect answer you think it is. \n___\n#As direct responses to your categories, however:\n\n##Global Warming\/Ecological Impact:\n\nThe fact that most of the world is not highly developed shows that a lot of this pollution comes not from a bigger population, but from more developed regions with higher population density. There are plenty of ways to cut down on pollution without necessarily reducing population size. There are pushes for green energy, more efficient technologies, tighter regulations on corporate environmental practices, pushes for recycling, mass transit and carpooling, electric cars, etc... By reducing the population, you might potentially slow the rate of development, but the issue of global warming is a cumulative effect of emissions over time. We'd still have to deal with the environmental changes, but perhaps we'd have more time to deal with it. That's more a bandaid fix than a solution outright. \n\n##Global Energy\/Food Shortage:\n\nIn terms of energy production and food supplies... we actually aren't doing that bad in the world. The only issue is that [developed nations hoard their resources](http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2015\/jan\/19\/global-wealth-oxfam-inequality-davos-economic-summit-switzerland), leading to starvation in regions like Africa and much of Asia. There was a great post over on \/r\/theydidthemath; and an [amazing comment](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/theydidthemath\/comments\/2qzts1\/request_how_much_money_would_it_cost_the_citizens\/cnb3apd) which calculated that first world countries only make up about 12% of the population, and even still it would only cost us 9\u00a2 a day to end world hunger, or less than 5% of the United States annual military spending.\n\nFor the energy part of this equation, we already have limitless resources for power (e.g. the sun, hydroelectrics, wind farms, etc...) we just need more pushes to actually pursue this technology, which is not going to make OPEC happy, but they do not represent the best interests of humanity in the long term. \n\n##War:\n\nReducing population isn't going to end violence or war any time soon. We've had wars throughout the history of humanity, even when the distances were great between peoples. Population may increase the relative stress of resource distribution, but with how technology has offset that process, it really comes down to violence, diplomacy, and greed. And as above with the effects of global warming; we're going to use up our resources eventually. The issue is not to try and slow the bleed, it's to explore other options to keep our growth sustainable. Looking towards alternative materials, recycling, asteroid mining, etc...\n\n##Epidemic:\n\nWe're already pursuing herd immunity and we've been able to destroy diseases like small pox in the past. Despite what the crazy anti-vaxxers might try to tell you, vaccinations are protecting our population from outbreaks. That said, increased population is a concern, but only if the health standards are affected by this increase in population. If living in sanitary conditions, the number of people is less important that the treatment received for illness. And, with the interconnection of the world, while you may reduce the overall population, the requirement for corporations, businesses, and interaction would lead to greater contact overall. The greatest threat in terms of epidemic and pandemic really is transportation, and how these diseases can ride on ships, planes, and trains to spread themselves rapidly. Population is only one factor.\n\n##Psychological issues:\n\nWhile there may be some stress from living in a big city, I don't think you can attribute all mental health issues, or indeed most, just to population side. Setting aside the fact that there are plenty of extroverts who would thrive in a more populous region, those who are under stresses that lead to depression and other mental illness are often driven there not by the number of people around them, but by the societal pressures that population brings.

If you leave them for a while they will go slightly stale, dry out faster as they are more exposed. For a utilitarian mind which may want a sandwich at any time perpendicular is the way to go.\n\nThe wide and varying width of the triangular cut makes it harder to avoid getting food on your mouth, wasted. As you slide it in it's easier for the edge to hit the corner of your mouth. This can be a big issue for a man in a rush- if you get mayo in your beard it's gonna be hard to get out.\n\nIt's also easier to stack a lot of them. With a rectangle you just put them on top of each other. With a triangle? That's more of an issue. Their floppiness means you can soon have a mess of ugly looking sandwiches falling over one another.\n\nTriangle sandwiches can often actually lead to more damage. Because of the shape if you put it in a ziplock bad then you tend to draw it out through a corner. This can lead to tearage and slippage of food.\n\nProvides a consistent dip into soup. With a triangle the wideness often blocks you dipping it deep enough, meaning you have to scrunch it or dip it, eat it, and then dip it again and burn your fingers a bit. A square or rectangle shape which has a consistent width is easier to dip.\nk9centipede: You present some interesting arguments for rectangular cuts.\n\n1) Long term storage:  \nYes, I guess you are right that a rectangular cut would be preferable to a triangular cut if you are going a long time between cutting and eating, but it'd be much easier to just leave the sandwich whole and then cut it when you're ready to eat. \n\n2) Messy when eating:  \nI don't see how a triangular cut would be any messier than a rectangular cut since you'd still be burying your face is sandwichness as you eat. Unless you're eating the sandwich from one short edge to the other short edge, whole bites at a time, you'd get a messy eating experience either way. And if you're eating a sandwich that way, then you're just bad at eating sandwiches. Unless you have scientific antidotes of that being a standard way of eating sandwiches?  \n\n3) Stacking:  \nI did some scientific research for that claim by googling 'Stacked Sandwiches' and [this triangular cut stack](http:\/\/www.acclaimimages.com\/_gallery\/_images_n300\/0015-0603-1710-5953_food_stack_bologna_sandwiches.jpg) not only came up earlier on the page than [this rectangular cut stack](http:\/\/www.foodiecrush.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/06\/stacked-sandwiches.jpg) but it has more in the stack.

This might be the strongest argument, as rectangular cuts placed vertically in a ziplock bag allow both halves to be easily removed, while the second triangle cut would have to be fished out. \n\n5) Dipping:  \nI think that the experience of dipping a triangle cut is much better than that of a rectangular cut, and the consistent dip the rectangle cut might provide is not enough to make it a better option there, but it would be an acceptable option for that.  \n\n&amp;#8710; you've changed my mind to see that rectangle cuts are ONLY preferable when transportation in a ziplock would be necessary, and that they are a valid option when dipping.

The way we are taught in medicine to look at alcoholism and other lifestyle diseases is in terms of relative risk. Physiology is important to consider because a great deal of how you respond to even basic, daily routines will have to do with genetics.\n\nSo, while it is fair to suggest (using another analogy) that a great deal of obesity is simply a matter of caloric intake there is a great deal of research to suggest the things that control everything from hormones such as insulin release, adiposity, basal metabolic rate, and other factors controlled by genetics contribute to a wide variety in [weight outcomes](http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=9403316)\n\nSo how does this apply to alcoholism?\n\n1.

Ownership of something doesn't just mean you have possession of it, but that you have the right to *control its use.* We talk about violations of IP as \"theft\" when in reality, it is closer to a violation of the right to control the property. \n\nSo if a person has a patent on a widget, he has the right to license and control the use of that widget. If he doesn't think it should be used in, say, weapons manufacturing- he has the right to deny the use of his IP in that field. \n\nNow say that a weapons company ignores this and uses the widget anyway. He has been wronged in two senses: first by loss of profits from the use of his widget (wherein the thing stolen is the *profit*, not the widget itself). Second, in the *control of the use* of the widget. The weapons manufacturer didn't deprive the inventor of *possession,* but he did deprive the inventor of *control.* \n\nSo while it may not be theft of the property (on your definition of theft), it *is still a violation of property rights.*\n\nEdit- To the economic utility point: I'm not sure I get your point. The argument in favor of IP is that IP will not be developed without protection for use and profit. This seems clearly correct: say a corporation could steal any patent from any inventor and deprive the inventor of profit or control without fear of reprimand. What incentive would the inventor have to devote time to inventing? What incentive would any person have to do research, when they would not be able to profit from the research.\n\n&gt;What we do know for sure, if a prohibition on commercial copying is implemented, is that individual rights will be violated.\n\nHow?\nRPrevolution: &gt;Ownership of something doesn't just mean you have possession of it, but that you have the right to control its use.\n\n\u2206 That's a better way to look at it.\n\nHowever, can someone have the right to control the use of something that's not scarce?  The whole purpose of property rights is to prevent conflict over scarce goods. \n\n&gt;Now say that a weapons company ignores this and uses the widget anyway. He has been wronged in two senses: first by loss of profits from the use of his widget (wherein the thing stolen is the profit, not the widget itself). \n\nCan potential profit be stolen?

The plot throws challenges and quick change at immature characters that are unprepared for it, they must adapt and must be brave and show what's inside, their internal struggle is often emphasized.\n\nAlso every character, good or bad, has motives and development. Yubaba the bathouse owner is not evil just because, she's got a business to run. The witch of the waste is heartbroken and proud, which leads to wrath. Lady Eboshi cared about her town, employing the marginalized lepers, starting nothing short of an industrial revolution, albeit forgetting the damage to the environment. \n\nThe braveness of characters is also rarely your macho western protagonist willing to face and slice million monsters and then self-immolate. The braveness is often displayed by vulnerable characters that have much to lose and don't have the skills or the strength to chop their way to victory, they must be cunning, firm, and rely on their (often newly made) friends if they want to succeed. \n\nAll this combined with the art and the music, like you mentioned, makes just about every Studio Ghibli film a masterpiece.\nTheAbjectLol: I knew, boldly breaking this subreddit's rules, that I wouldn't be able to reply within 3 hours when I posted this (as I'm in Australia and I posted just before I went to sleep), so I'm not sure if me replying to this comment will be of much or any use.

Some people like the ability to do things in public but still be private (ever fired off illegal bottle rockets in a massive field as a kid just for kicks, knowing that there's no chance anyone's around for miles to bitch at you for it?). Some people like having lots of animals. Some people like the lack of pseudo-anonymity and prefer to get to know their neighbors well.\n\nThere's really no way to convince you that country life is preferable, because it all comes down to what you personally prefer. The best I can do, maybe, is convince you that country life is preferable to *some people.*\n\nFor the record, I love city life and hate country life (I've done both).

As you've mentioned, it deals from issues ranging from inheritance to taxes to medical decisions to child custody. These default rules can be modified via prenuptial agreements, but it still stands as a basic package for people with a legally recognized relationship.\n\nYour suggestion flows from good intentions where couples who want to formalize their romantic relationship create their own contract and dictate its terms. The problem with this is that marriage touches on so many aspects - [over 1,000 federal laws alone](http:\/\/www.gao.gov\/assets\/230\/223674.pdf) ([2004 update](http:\/\/www.gao.gov\/new.items\/d04353r.pdf)) - that building it from the ground up is cumbersome, time consuming, and probably expensive to the extent it would require a lawyer. You would be asking people to contemplate all the circumstances and likelihoods that matrimonial law effectively does already by virtue of having the same issues arise for hundreds of years.\n\nIn a way, marriage functions as a very egalitarian institution because it is within easy reach of broad swaths of people. For ~$40.00 you can get what you or an attorney would (for a fee) have to draft.  You would have to hope it contemplates all of the same things and that every clause is legally enforceable. Making it more costly - actually (legal fees and associated costs) and through time\/effort spent - makes marriage far less accessible. We already have an access-to-justice problem. Low-income people can't get the legal representation they need, particularly with civil issues, because it's too costly and pro bono\/legal aid societies can't effectively pick up the slack.\n\nRequiring people to create marriage-like agreements piecemeal and then be on the alert to update it every time their circumstance changes is not only problematic generally, but will just exacerbate this access issue and predominantly affect people in lower socioeconomic circles. Even when we talk about boilerplate forms one can download off the Internet, these oftentimes fall short and would still require the creation and formalization (probably notarized too) of each and every right and responsibility flowing from marriage as it stands today.\n\nAlso, this ignores another issue: non-marital laws still work in conjunction with and refer to marital status. Social Security is not matrimonial law but it still creates benefits based on marital status. Inheritance law is not matrimonial law but it still creates rights and presumptions based on marital status. Evidence law is not matrimonial law but it still creates privileges based on marital status. Bearing this in mind:\n\n1. You can't just get the government 'out of marriage' by turning it into a traditional contractual relationship because you would still have to get rid of statutorily created rights\/benefits\/privileges\/presumptions that were drafted independently, and;\n\n2. Since it's unlikely that we'll just reform these laws piecemeal, each individual law can still dictate what kind of relationships it chooses to acknowledges for the purpose of that statute, i.e., still discriminate against 'peculiar' kinds of relationships. We saw (2) arise when some states legalized gay marriage but those couples only had equal status in state law, not federal law, pre-*Windsor*. You (general you) and your four partners can draft your contract, but the SSA and Congress can still be jerks and say their death benefits are only for monogamous two-party couples so long as they have a rational basis for it.\n\nMoreover, the law that would govern traditional contracts is ill-suited for the nature of marriage. Contract law is designed to facilitate *arms-length* economic transactions to allow the economic pie to grow bigger.  It is enforced, in part, by the state.  Marriage is by definition intimate. We don't breach marriages. We don't sue our partners for damages if things don't work out. Instead, we have equitable dissolution, the parameters of which are outlined primarily by state marriage (not contract) laws.  It was created to ensure both parties leave in the best way possible (even if it is imperfect) rather than \"making them pay.\" Sure, we could keep these rules, but then we'd be circling right back to a special body of law that caters to the unique circumstances arising out of marriage that we just don't care about in a standard contracts.\n\nIf we're going to discuss marriage equality between monogamous and non-monogamous couples, it would probably be better to do things with an eye towards reform of present marriage law rather than non-monogamous couples deferring to recreating a marriage-like scenario from the ground up. This is what gay and lesbian couples have historically had to do and there is a reason they pushed for marriage equality beyond the ability to make a solemn, public declaration, and that's because the extent to which that status affects the partners is massive.\n\nMarriage creates sensible rights, defined contours and presumptions for important issues of natural consequence when we invest our lives, finances and future into a community of interests.  Getting government out of it is unlikely to solve its inequities.\nVanbone: First of all, thank you for your well written and thoughtful response. You make a number of very good points, but they seem largely pragmatic, based in the difficulty of changing or re-making the gargantuan system that currently exists. This is certainly valid, but I confess that I find it somewhat difficult to reconcile with my views, which I confess are largely philosophical. \n\n&gt; Even when we talk about boilerplate forms one can download off the Internet, these oftentimes fall short and would still require the creation and formalization (probably notarized too) of each and every right and responsibility flowing from marriage as it stands today.\n\nTo my view, though I certainly have not dealt in writing contracts professionally, a good deal of society relies on contracts, which are open to customization, but largely standardized. I would envision marriage contracts could be similarly standardized, while still allowing for the individual needs and desires to the participants. \n\n&gt; We don't breach marriages. We don't sue our partners for damages if things don't work out. Instead, we have equitable dissolution - the parameters of which are outlined primarily by state marriage (not contract) laws - that was created to ensure both parties leave in the best way possible (even if it is imperfect) rather than \"making them pay.\" Sure, we could keep these rules, but then we'd be circling right back to a special body of law that caters to the unique circumstances arising out of marriage that we just don't care about in a standard contracts. \n\nYou make a good point here. I suppose on some level you've changed my view - I don't necessarily feel that society should be torn down and reformed so that it's systems no longer take marriage into consideration (though considering the divorce rate, there may be other arguments for that). So perhaps marriage should have, if not more oversight, *different* oversight from traditional contracts. I still believe that the Government should have extremely limited power to regulate who can and cannot enter into a marriage, but that is a strong shift in my view at the least. \n\nThank you, I'll award you a delta as soon as I figure out how. \n\nedit: &amp;#8710; = \u2206","1026":"theconstipator: The thing about \"fat acceptance\" is, its sort of glorifying being unhealthy.

Too late, it just crushed your throat with its jaws.\n\nAlso, I would probably make the argument that you couldn't defeat a wolf. I don't know you personally but I don't know many people who could defeat a wolf. A lot of times it may come down to the first blow. If the animal strikes first and chomps down on you hard, you're going to be in excruciating pain and your main focus will probably be getting the animal off instead of trying to kill it in that moment. You'll be losing blood, getting tired, and getting weaker as this goes on. Even if you strike the first blow, the wolf may snap back and get you. While you have to think about how to actually kill the beast and when the best opportunity to do so is, the wolf is only focused on ripping you to pieces.\n\nFighting a pomeranian would be a different story.\nnickwhittaker: \/u\/exploremedora I am wondering if you have any thoughts on what \/u\/xantiherox said below regarding dogs and their weaknesses. \n\n&gt; The only weapons a dog has are his mouth\/bite and his claws. canine claws really aren't that substantial, and the way a canine's body is put together is such that they have a pretty limited range of motion with either their front or hind legs. They need 3 of their limbs functional to be mobile. They don't have the power to break a adult male human leg.\nso off the bat I think a human is at an advantage just in terms of body structure. we can us our arms, legs, head, mouth, and inflict damage with all of these. our kicks and punches are more powerful.\nAdd intelligence and it's pretty much game over. Any object can be used as a weapon. A rock can be thrown from a distance or used as a hammer, a stick becomes a spear, etc, etc.\nIf you are familiar with fighting you know weak spots: eyes, neck, spine, ribs, genitals, limbs. You know these are the areas to attack and that these are the areas you need to protect on yourself. But a canine isn't really capable of inflicting serious damage to a humans back or ribs or limbs (I'm talking about attacking them such that you can't use a limb; a dog isn't going to break your arm or leg or back with it's bite, at least not an average adult male). So a human really needs to only be seriously worried about their eyes\/face, neck, and groin. A dog pretty much has no defense.\nIf you can take a dog's back it's over. their snout is such that one could easily grab it's jaws and twist to break it's neck. Kicks to the ribs, limbs back, from a human male, are forceful enough to break a dogs bones. Knees to a dogs skull or ribs would also be very effective.\nThe biggest disadvantage a human has is human fear. If you are able to overcome that I don't really think a dog has any chance. If you realize that if you don't kill the dog the dog is going to kill you, you'll do what needs to be done.\nAgain I am talking about an average male who knows how to fight, is of average intelligence and is in good physical shape.\nI have grown up with rottweiler's and german shepherds. We fought. Granted they weren't trying to kill me (I just like to play rough with my pets) and while I have certainly been bitten and blood has been drawn more than a few times, it has always been pretty obvious that if I really wanted\/needed to, the dog wouldn't stand a chance. But, I am trained in multiple martial arts since I was 4, and have fought people. A dog isn't going to put you in an arm bar or rear naked choke. I think knowing how to fight gives one a better chance than being an adult male. And being able to use objects is a pretty big advantage as well. Near water? just hold the thing under.\nThe only way a dog is going to beat me is if I let my guard down and it gets my neck.\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dw8af1K4Z_4 (Boy kills adult german shepherd with bard hands) (doesn't show it, it is just the news story. the dog was a police dog. the kid strangled it. shows the kid after the fight being taken into custody. his clothes are torn, but no substantial injuries.).\nI tried to find the last known case of an adult male being killed by a single dog, but I couldn't find anything.\n\n","3800":"StanleyDarsh22: backing into a spot where no cars are moving and you can see exactly what's behind you, VS backing out into the road where cars can be flying by because people don't know how to drive safely in parking lots, added to that bigger blind spots and possibility of huge trucks parked next to you.\n\nchoose one.\n\n\nshould note that this doesn't apply to the parking lots that have the angled parking spaces.  those you should only ever pull in forward.\nNJFiend: Hmmm.

However, that makes him a better target, not a worse one. It would be completely pointless to show up at a Donald Trump rally and say something about Black Lives Matter (or any racial issue). Donald Trump is a clear and overt racist. There is nothing that can be done to make Donald Trump a good candidate on race. Bernie Sanders is a relatively good candidate on race, but many people who have race as the primary political issue that they care about believe that he could be better.
