I have Ego twist 650 and 1100 Mah batts to pair with it.\nbadst33l: I have to agree with you on this community being so great.  I found it almost a month ago and it's really nice to have some place to go where you can get input on different items, help with trouble-shooting, and just enjoy all things vape related.   \n\nWhich of the following best characterizes the discourse type of the previous statement?\nA: Question\nB: Answer\nC: Agreement\nD: Disagreement\nE: Appreciation\nF: Elaboration\nG: Humor\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

Yes, he had a bad game, but I am not saying he should not start.\n\nWhat I am saying is now that we are sitting at 2 losses and will likely have 3 more (Auburn, UF, Clemson) if not more it is time to start getting people ready for next year. I understand during these first games they have all been close and the opportunity has not occurred. However, now that SEC East is pretty much a pipe dream need to do some roster management.\n\nI think you have to play Mitch or whoever you think the QB of the future is for 2-4 series a game. We can not go into next year with no QBs on the roster who have not taken a meaningful snap.\nTheCholl: Yes.\n\nYou've nicely phrased the gist of a comment I made in a thread after week one. We are not a championship team this year. It's better to get the underclassmen in shape for next year than chase another 11-2. We have flaws throughout the team, not just at QB. But Dylan is simply not a starter. He has had 5 years to learn how to think in the pocket and throw a ball, yet he still can't do it consistently or with precision. \n\nDylan may have patiently waited his turn, but I think that there is a point at which rewarding loyalty isn't in anyone's best interest. \n\nWhich of the following best characterizes the discourse type of the previous statement?\nA: Question\nB: Answer\nC: Agreement\nD: Disagreement\nE: Appreciation\nF: Elaboration\nG: Humor\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

Resolutions have surely been made and broken already heads were hanging low and heavy the following morning after over indulgence on the eve of the new year yet change remains a constant theme. I've seen this place grow to the point that were now at 12,000+ members and I'm really excited to see what 2013 has in store for our little corner of the Internet.\n\nFirst of all I would like to thank you for the recognition. I'm honored to have this position and hope to serve you all well this month. Having been a cigar smoker for 10+ years I thought that I was well versed in the lifestyle but then a few short months ago I stumbled across this sub reddit and my eyes were opened even further. I love this place and everything it offers. I've expanded my knowledge of our great hobby from reading posts here and I've always tried to provide some of my own relevant input so that we can all help to learn from each other in this great place. Once again thank you to all the great BOTL/SOTL out there on r/cigars, raise your glasses cuz this one is for you....\n\nNow enough of my babble, you wanna know what the cigar of the month is right ? I mean that's why you're here. So I thought about last night and asked a few of my friends for their opinion. At first I thought why not use the theme 2013 and pick something with that infamous 13 and the first thought was the FFOX forbidden 13 as its certainly worthy of the title, but I'm a humble guy and I wanted to make sure the CoTM was something attainable so that we may all enjoy it. So I made a short list an finally a winner emerged. I went back to that 13 theme, and I made my choice **the first CoTM for 2013 is going to be the Asylum** choose your preferred vitola or blend, heck try em all. Personally I like the Asylum toro. [Here is a little info if youre unfamiliar](http://www.halfwheel.com/press-release-asylum-cigars-kicks-doors-inaugural-launch/)\n\n\nI've had Asylums. I've actually smoked the entire line of all vitolas including the Asylum 13 and the Schizo blends. I really enjoy them, my B&M can't keep them in stock but they seem to be widely available in stores as well as online at the major cigar sites. So I want you all to try them... I'm not sure if you international brothers and sisters can get them but if you're interested in obtaining some then send me a PM and Ill gladly try to work out a trade with a few of you to get some in the right hands. I'd also like to get some in the hands of our featured reviewers to get their input. I'll be hosting another contest or two this month to give you a chance to win some. If its popular enough I may even start a pass or two out there. So there you have I challenge you all to go out and enjoy one of these tasty cigars...\n\nHasta La Victor Simpre! \n\n-Timmy \n\n**TL;DR Thanks r/cigars and the CoTM is the Asylum**\n\n\nplotbe01: I love the asylums, excellent choice.

    "45": "HydrogenHuman: We know Korra & Asami are very close at this point in the series, and I still believe there will be a \"climatic\" moment finalizing their bond between each other.\n\nBelow I've listed possible scenarios based on how far Nickelodeon would be willing to depict Korra & Asami's relationship, and I think these are fairly accurate.\n\nAlso bear in mind, that Nick was willing to show the following *VIOLENT* scenes:\n\n1. A murder/suicide with Amon & Tarrlok by blowing up their boat.\n\n2. *DIRECTLY* showing the Earth Queen being **strangulated** by having the air pulled out of her lungs.\n\n3. Indirectly showing Pai-Li's head being blown off.\n\n4. *DIRECTLY* showing Ming-Hua being **electrocuted to death.**\n\n**What Nick would definitely allow**\n\n1. **Asami & Korra holding hands.** We've already seen Asami grasp Korra's hand tightly, so if they showed Korra & Asami wrapping their hands together, they would definitely allow it.\n2. **Asami placing her hand on Korra's cheek/face** I'm fairly certain Nick would allow this, and it could show Korra grasping Asami's hand that is on her face, possibly tearing up too (bonus points for us!)\n3. **Korra resting her head on Asami's shoulder** Again, Nick would probably allow this, primarily because it would still be ambiguous.\n\n**What Nick would be 50/50 on allowing**\n\n1. **Asami & Korra touching foreheads together (similar to Korra & Mako)** Nick would be reluctant, but they may allow this one, because the parallels could be drawn.\n2. **Asami kisses Korra on the top of the head** This is still my personal favorite, but this would also be probably be the furthest Nick would ever go. \n\nMeanwhile, they wouldn't mind showing Bataar Jr. or Kuvira getting vaporized by the spirit beam, I'm sure.\n\n\n**What Nick would be against, and has a very small, but possible chance**\n\n1. **Asami kisses Korra on the forehead** The \"forehead\" kiss is about the furthest you can go to show in terms of ambiguity, I feel. A forehead kiss can be interpreted as a close friend showing how much they care, or can be interpreted as love. Nick would have a heart attack, I'm sure, but it does have small chance based on context.\n\n2. **Asami gives a short kiss to Korra on the cheek** Women (and men) from other cultures outside the US have been known to do this, and it isn't interpreted as romance, but close friendship.\n\nWe would all **die** of course if this happened, but probably most of the Nick executives are so sexually repressed from the USA culture they would have a hard time letting it through.\n\nAgain, Nick was willing to show extreme violence in the form of murder/death, but depicting love between two women, even if it is the friendship kind of \"love\"... \n\n\"OH NO! That's too offensive! It's even worse than combining all the violent scenes combined!\"\nSlyfox00: I am completely sure we have endgame korrasami. I've already come to terms with the fact it's probably going to be shown with something diplomatic like handholding or similar to things you mentioned. It will be clear enough that naysayers will simply look ridiculous if they try clam it's platonic.  \n\nAsami: \"You did it Korra!\"\n\nKorra: \"No, we did it\" ~hand grab and smile~ then big group hug\n\nor something similar\n\n\nLike you said the chances they kiss are slim, but I'll take those odds! I feel we've got a very good shot at seeing a head/forehead/cheek/lip kiss.\n\nAny sort of kiss between those two and I would go 100% foamy mouth guy. \n\nI think Nick is a little more queer friendly than they get credit for. They are a business first, and right now is smart to be LGBT inclusive. Something like Korra ending with overt lesbian kiss would be great for positive media buzz. They would get attention on on the network shows, Blu Ray and DvD sales would increase, site traffic would explode. It Bryke wants Korrasami, nick will give it to them. \n\nhttp://news.nick.com/10/2014/03/coming-out/ \n\nWhich of the following best characterizes the discourse type of the previous statement?\nA: Question\nB: Answer\nC: Agreement\nD: Disagreement\nE: Appreciation\nF: Elaboration\nG: Humor\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

In the final 4.5 hours, the T1 cutoff increased by 5094 while T2 increased by 4251. Furthermore, this is the first time that the point gain in the final half hour of a token event has breached 1k. Needless to say, this is absolutely crazy and I'm sorry to anyone who missed the cutoffs because of such an unexpected last-minute surge.\nluciusftw: I noticed the same thing when I was tracking it. Like it went from being consistently behind the Maki event (well, T2 anyway) to the gains being 1.5-2x Maki's. I was actually legitimately afraid for like a 1500 point cutoff hike in the last 30 minutes for T1. It seems like the loveca inflation's primary victim will be T1; T2 came out relatively unscathed other than the rush at the end.\n\nI've also learned not to take predictions for granted.

Red has two spells like that. There are 5 dual-colored spells for each guild this time, but still only 1 hybrid.\n\nRares:\n\nOnly 4 rares for each color. Blue and Green have 1 double casting cost spell, Red 2, and White and Black 3. There are 4 dual-colored spells for each guild, and still only 1 hybrid. \n\nMythics:\n\nEach color gets a mythic, each guild gets two dual colored ones. No hybrid mythics, wouldn't that be something, though?\n\nWhile this does pretty much absolutely nothing for us now, come next spoiler season, I think it may help speculate what is to come. I doubt Wizards is going to do Gatecrash too differently than RtR. Sorry if I messed anything up and/or if this is just boring. Feel free to add stuff and I can update it.\n\n**EDIT**\n\nCycles:\n\nEvery guild gets a guildmage, guild leader, a charm, and a freebie. One spell that can't be countered. *But those prolly aren't gonna be in the next set.* They also get a single mono-colored creature that has an activated ability with the mana requirement of the other color of the guild. All of these creatures are commons.\n\nI don't know if this is relevant, but every color except white has a common Defender. Blue is the only one with an uncommon, and Golgari is the only guild with a defender.\nredthrax: I noticed a bit of the pattern myself. Interestingly it seems like Cycles are being really played up, giving each guild and each color it's own variation on a similar thing. By giving every color/guild something equal, like a spell that can't be countered or a cheap hybrid, they have incredible balance while also keeping things diverse.\n\nSo give yourself a little bit of constriction and you actually open yourself up to alot of design space.

I went and the woman who did it was super professional, really nice, and funny enough to take the edge off of getting it done while making my friend and I very comfortable about the whole thing. Also very reassuring that despite my fears, my nipples would not, in fact, fall off from sticking needles in them or any of the other awful situations I'd managed to imagine. Marked up easy, went through perfectly neat, and the pain was completely manageable. It was more of a \"ow, that hurts, and also this feels really strange because I can feel this needle traveling through skin\" sort of thing. Had to take a break after the first since I get shaky and lightheaded post piercing no matter how well fed I am, and then we did the second one. Hurt a little more than the first, but nothing bad at all. I honestly thought my belly button hurt worse. Didn't bleed, and ached a little bit for a few hours afterwards, but then no pain at all! I woke up this morning expecting to hurt, nope, still no pain. Had to double check that I'd actually gotten them done, haha. My friend got hers done with me as well and I texted her when I woke up asking if yesterday had happened since there was no pain, and she told me she didn't hurt at all either. I couldn't be happier right now and I am so glad I finally decided to get them done. Just thought I'd share a good piercing experience! \n[deleted]: Awesome! I had a very similar experience.

    "64": "[deleted]: There has been a lot of debate why /r/Atheism seems to just attack Christians and rightfully so.  It is actually easily explained and has two root causes.  \nThe first of all is a lot of the people who post on /r/Atheism are ex Christians who were forced into Christianity.  They feel like they were taken advantage of when they were children and posting anti-Christian post on /r/atheism without social and financial consequence is how they fight back.  \nThe next one is the Christian attempt to interfere in peoples lives.  From Gay Marriage, Abortion, non-secularism to Evolution, Christians attempt to interfere in science and peoples bed rooms.  You combine this was hypocrisy and you are going to piss off a lot of people.  If other religions gain the power to affect the political and social fabric in the United States Christians have you will start to see a lot of attacks on that religion, people hate being told what to do.  Except for you UK, there should be way more anti-Islam I expect more anti-Islam stuff from you guys.  Someone knocks a beer out of my hand on purpose I am knocking their teeth down their throat.  Where did all the soccer hooligans go?  So keep the anti-religion going, a lot of the Christians hate us because we are effective and see us as a threat.  We are telling the King he has no cloths on and the people are listening.  It is the free flow of information that will kill religion\n\nedit-1 I also like to mention certain Christian Sects are not attacked on /r/Atheism while others are mentioned very often.  A lot of it has to do with their interference in other peoples lives.  If Christians would leave people alone they wouldn't be attacked as much.

People are wrong when they say it's a terrible disappointment, but I felt there were just a few simple things that would have made it a lot better that if used in a sequel would make it perfect. I was hoping Reddit could weigh in:\n\n*A higher difficulty curve. One of the things I was disappointed by was how powerful you are right from the start. It takes a fraction of a second to hack something, which made it feel a little unsatisfying. I expected that you would start with only one weak profiler ability like signal jamming and work your way up. And you do upgrade, but how powerful you are at the beginning takes away the urge to work toward upgrades. Far Cry 3 is a great example of how a Watch Dogs sequel could handle this better; you start with virtually nothing, which makes upgrading much more enticing.\n\n*The random criminal encounters shouldn't be so finicky. Possibly my biggest frustration with the game was how easy it is to accidentally tip off the criminals and stop something that could have been fun. This led me to wasting time tailing a criminal with no payoff. In a sequel, it would be more satisfying if the crime basically is going to happen whether you're there or not. The window of time where you can swoop in and save the day should be much bigger too. Many times I felt like the crime was easily in progress by the time I intervened, only to accidentally abort it because I was half a second early. It's odd that the guards can be so ignorant when you're knocking over a control center, yet the random criminals seem to have perfect eyesight and superhuman peripheral vision. The problems with this feature make it feel not so much unsatisfying as broken.\n\nThese are the major ones that stood out to me. What would you like to see? Improved driving?

Frustrating with the amount of stop signs and stop lights, but again short trip( $5ish).  \n\n**Trip #3a:** Saw that Potomac, MD was surging at 2.8x so I decided to head in that direction from Arlington.  Got about 1/2 there (near Tysons) and the surge dropped completed.  Somewhat like a moving tornado or thunder storm.  Needless to say Tysons was dead and I figured lets head back to Old Town for the night.\n\n**Trip #4:** Old Town at this time (around 1030) was surging around 1.4x so I did one last trip and picked up my PAX and had a bit longer drive home (10-15 mins roughly 7-9 miles).  $11 trip, muccch better.\n\nHeaded home happy, with my first Uber Driving experience.\n\nFew things I noticed, don't try and chase the surge totally not worth it.  \n\nAnyone have any tips/pointers for a new driver?

    "135": "ChokingVictim: What's going on with this subreddit, lately? It seem like every thread with someone who is perceived as \"attractive\" is filled to the brim with cynicism. How is that helpful? Take, for example, [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/amiugly/comments/ghue7/well_how_bout_it_amiugly/). The first two comments are insults, and the thread is filled with mostly people making fun of the OP's appearance (yes, I know it is sarcasm and that the OP is a good looking man--but, again, how does that help his esteem? Sarcasm does not carry over well on the internet.). This subreddit is supposed to be a sanctuary for honest responses, where people who are already vulnerable make themselves even more vulnerable to strangers. Insulting them, even jokingly, can be misunderstood and is entirely the wrong thing to do for this subreddit. They're trusting us to give them an honest answer. \n\nCan we cut back on the cynism and be more polite? So what if the person asking the question is what you perceive as attractive? Attraction lies in the eye of the beholder, and that means not that he or she is the same to all. An honest response is much more useful than a sarcastic insult.\n\nAlso, I'd like to remind all those complaining about \"attractive\" people posting that many of these people aren't trolling. They honestly have self esteem issues, or have received no feedback, thus resulting in an assumption that they are not attractive. Some of these people have never even been on a date, yet they look stunning. As a result, they struggle with themselves and come to us for answers. To mock them for this is embarrassing and just plain dumb.\n\nRemember: this subreddit is not \"post if you're ugly,\" it's \"Am I Ugly?\" It's a question--you don't have to be ugly to post here. You simply need to want that question answered. Bashing someone for being attractive does nothing to help the situation, it just stops others from posting.  \nPsychoM: I had/have self esteem issues. I admit it. I've said this in my thread and this is my take on things. Hopefully it helps.\n\n>Okay I'm going to be completely honest and open. I truly feel this and I hate it.\n\n>I honestly don't feel like I'm handsome, pretty or cute. I think backindenim is very handsome and I can't even BEGIN to compare myself with him. People tell me that I'm decent looking but every time I look in the mirror, I don't really see what they're seeing. I see that I'm pale to the point of looking unhealthy, my smile is crooked, my teeth aren't aligned, my hair is naturally wavy (I straighten it every day because I don't think it looks good), I get bouts of acne, I'm not as muscular as I want to be and my nose is kinda flat. I guess it's because I've studied my face and I've pulled out all my imperfections but that's seriously all I see. I've effectively convinced myself that I'm not good looking. Don't know why. So you might be thinking (or from what I've been reading) \"Oh he's attractive, he doesn't need to be here. He's just mocking the rest of the people and wasting time\" but I don't think I'm attractive. I think I'm average at best.\n\n>I admit that I wasn't expecting to be told I was ugly considering that the trend has been that people think that I'm good looking. But I kind of need this to make sure that I'm not as bad as I think I am. I can't speak for anyone else besides myself but I suspect that others may feel the same as me and I empathize with them because I know how terrible it feels.\n\n>Message to others like me: I may not know much because I'm still a kid but if someone younger than me is going through something like this I hope this helps. I used to be very shy and would dread one on one interactions because I could feel their scrutiny and them noticing that my teeth are crooked or that I have perpetual bags under my eyes. Every day I'd spend at least an hour in front of a mirror to check that everything was still okay. It got to a point where I still use my phone cover as a mirror every time I bring it out because I'm used to it. I know how every comment can feel like a gunshot that gets infected and rots in your brain for years. Someone once told me after a baseball game that I smelt like a locker room. I avoided people after baseball games, didn't go to outings afterwards for a year. It hurts I know. But you are awesome. It all matters in what you tell yourself. If you feel like the king of cool, people start to believe you are the king of cool. If you think you are some ugly weak person, you become one. I look in the mirror for half an hour and just point out the things I like about myself. It's a process but I'm starting to get better. I have much more friends. I have girlfriends.

I am still good at many of the games I play, even though I'm not practicing as much as others.\n\n> It seems that hulu has a different idea of what hardcore is compared to how many gamers see it.

I know many people that spend hours a day playing a combination of flash games, facebook games, and smartphone games, but they are hardly \"hardcore\" into those games.\n\n> *This is why many people lump COD games into the casual category.\n\nThen i realized that A) I was very late to the party and B) I was trying to have input in a gaming thread that was not a 1 liner or meme image.\n\nSo now I come to you guys to ask what IS a hardcore gamer (or game...)?

    "142": "Pumaunknown: Hi TO ppl - posting for the first time but I've spent some time reading everything about OHIP changes that I could in this sub so thank you to those who shared their experiences. \n\nI got referred yesterday from my GP - they filled everything out today once I got the clinic I'm going with (McLean). What remains now is an approval letter from OHIP but my GP seems to think this won't take nearly as long as the previous CAMH process. Some info about me: I am a genderqueer transmasculine person who has been on Androgel topical T for four years. \n\nFor those of us who have the referral from the GP and were looking to get surgery through a funded clinic - I just got off the phone with McLean's patient services person. I asked her about the funding - ie. Will it change with the GRS changes - and she said, for top surgery, they'll know more in the first well of May, but they are looking at \"more funded with a small fee for chest contouring\" - take that as you will. I'm taking it to be that the funding will be better than the 1K My brain was too excited to really process but I went ahead and booked the next available consult which, at this point, is July. I am definitely calling back the first week of May and checking in with them. \n\nAnyway, maybe some of you have been digging around as well and might find this info useful!\n\nAlso, so far, these are \"highlights\" from what I heard from this sub and from talking to my friend who is a GP (which is not a lot) and some trans/gnc friends:\n\n- In my completely unscientific poll of friends and acquaintances, McLean appears to be the go-to top surgery surgeon in the GTA - but he currently is not completely covered by OHIP - they reimburse the mastectomy part but currently one can expect to pay 6K out of pocket.   The convo I had with the clinic, however, seems promising so I booked a consult\n- Dr. Dupre is another surgeon in GTA that does the top surgery (source: this sub, search for \"ftm surgeon,\" his name will come up). Apparently more expensive (10K?) but I would imagine that OHIP will fund a portion of it as does with McLean\n- Out-of-province: Drs. Brassard and Belanger in Montreal, totally funded (source: again this thread but this perhaps common knowledge as for a while theirs was the only clinic CAMH was sending patients to) - I imagine as this is the clinic that is for sure funded that the wait list is still v long. There's surgeons in Ottawa who do the procedure but tbh I really didn't do too much reading up on them (I live in TO and have family in MTL), they're found pretty easily on this sub though   \n- My personal doc (who is excellent and really caring) is very much in the dark about these policies and while they happily referred me for surgery, they simply have no idea who in Ontario will be accepting OHIP funding \n\n\n[deleted]: [deleted] \n\nWhich of the following best characterizes the discourse type of the previous statement?\nA: Question\nB: Answer\nC: Agreement\nD: Disagreement\nE: Appreciation\nF: Elaboration\nG: Humor\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "143": "GoodbyeBourbon: Hey everyone, \n\nIt's been a really rough month for me. While my count is accurate and I haven't relapsed or had any slips, for the last few weeks I've felt closer to the first week than, say, months 7 or 8 in my confidence.\n\nI've been working a job with a lot of boneheads. What I thought was going to be a good, challenging next step in my career has been a really trying, highly political job. I spend more time dealing with the maneuvering and trying to get people to actually say and commit to things versus time spent doing what I would consider to be \"my job\". In short, it's a lot of stress for all the wrong reasons, and I'm looking for a new option.\n\nI say this because I think it's probably a big chunk of why this month has sucked, and I suspect the stress is part of why my thinking has been so messed up. \n\nA week ago, we basically had a situation fall apart and finally had to have this really shitty group meeting to get everyone's negativity out. I knew which way the meeting was going, and so when I slipped out 90 minutes before the meeting, all I could think about was, \"It'd be really great to have a drink or three to steady myself and get through this.\" I didn't; I went for a walk and sat down at a nearby restaurant. Just ordered some junk comfort food and didn't drink. I was really dreading getting seated though, because I thought they were going to pull the old lunch-rush-parties-of-one-at-the-bar routine and I didn't have it in me to explain that I wasn't comfortable with that (fortunately, that didn't happen). \n\nMy dreams have been a real mess, it seems to be almost like withdrawals all over again - really messed up and vivid stuff. I've had three or four dreams in the last week where I drank because I reasoned I'd gone so long without that a drink wouldn't hurt. And then I'd be stricken with guilt and unhappiness almost immediately in the dream. I even remember one dream where I finished a glass of terrible wine, thought, \"see? I can do it. I'll just finish this bottle one glass at a time over the next few nights, and then I'll get some beer because that'd be nice.\" Then, of course, another section of my brain said, \"This is, of course, proof positive that you have a problem and why you don't drink anymore.\"\n\nYesterday was by far the worst. We'd had a nice, long, fun day. We realized we had no dessert on hand, so we improvised and blended some frozen banana and topped with chocolate. My wife was thrilled and said, \"I can't tell this from chocolate ice cream at all.\" All the while, I felt like I was on the Nostromo at the end of Alien. There was something about that banana taste with the bitter of the chocolate that reminded me of a few scotches I used to have, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was doing something I said I wouldn't do - and in full view of my spouse. I told her at the time why I was being weird, but it was just so upsetting.\n\nSo here I am. Month 10 and no drinks. Obviously this points to dealing with some other stuff and I am planning to get out of my job, but I just needed to get this off my chest, because it's had me bent out of shape like I can't put into words for a while now. \nDataDorker: Hang in there!

    "149": "caled: \nJossWhedonsDick: Finally got around to watching this, and woof--easily the strongest episode of the season. This season, while still extremely good, has been light on the beauty, wonder, and tenderness that weaved through the first season and a half, trading in for increasing tension and complex darkness and weirdness (which the show still does really well). The finale seems to be making up for that, almost leaning so far in the other direction as to become maudlin. But, again, Rectify pretty much nails everything it attempts, so even the sentimentality feels pitch perfect.\n\nGod, so many tearful goodbyes. Amantha-Jon-Janet-Daniel. Tawney-Teddy (for the zillionth time). Amantha-Jon. Daniel-Tawney (that dream was so expertly done; you kind of knew it wasn't Daniel's dream and started to figure it was Tawney's but the transition was perfect). And then, finally, of course, Janet-Daniel, perhaps the strongest of them all (it would've been nice to have seen them interact more over the course of the season, instead of back-loading it all into this episode, though, no?).\n\nYou could make an argument for this as a series finale if it wasn't for a few things like the still struggling Talbot marriage and the on-going investigation being loose ends. Oh, and this was the funniest episode of the season. Instead of strange, bleak, or black humor, it was all played pretty straight, a little silly, and Daniel just giving us a charm offensive overload. Mixed with all the farewells, made for a great sweet-and-sour combination.\n\nbut lol @ Jared. Show still can't figure out what to do with him.

    "151": "Rapn3rd: Today is day 5, and I feel good.\n\nYesterday, I noticed my friend scraping his grinder for keef, to which my other friend inquired, \"getting keefed?\" He said no, I'm just out of weed. I reached for my jar with roughly one bowl of weed's worth left in it and handed it to him saying here, you can have this. He asked me why, and I said I'm taking a break, naively expecting it to stop there.\n\nHe asked why, as he has every other time and I replied saying that there are several reasons, asthma being the main one. Our other friend who has smoked plenty, but never been addicted to it, nor has he smoked anywhere near what I have, responded with, \"You know, you could always just not smoke as much\". My other friend, who had accepted my gift of a free bowl said something about how I always quit for like a week with some stupid reason. I forget his exact wording because at this point I started to feel defensive, and angry. What the fuck dude, I gave you free weed when you were clearly in need of it, I figured I wouldn't be persecuted for my desire to stop, especially when it is directly benefiting you.\n\nThen I stopped. My first friend who made the comment about smoking less didn't understand, and it wasn't worth explaining it to him, because his input was irrelevant. And as for the other friend, he had seen me take breaks, some of which were with the intent to stop and then I failed, so to an extent, he has historical data to support his rudely stated claim.\n\nI wanted to be mad about it, I wanted to tell him to fuck off and that just because he is addicted to weed and won't admit it has short comings doesn't mean I need to adhere to the same standard of living. So I took a step back from the situation. I laughed it off, and didn't push the issue. I don't mind people smoking near me, and most of the time, I only have urges to smoke when I'm really upset and need to calm myself down the wrong way, or if I'm really bored and wanna game on a Saturday. I proceeded to play battlefield four with my friends, went 35 and 8 on a map, and realized I had plenty of fun without being high and that I'm actually better at games when I'm sober.\n\nThe point of this post is to remind people, and myself, that some of the hardest challenges will be faced externally. Other friends who are less experienced potheads, or the ones who literally smoke circles around you and don't understand how it effects others, or themselves will challenge your resolve. I'm proud that I stood strong, and I know that the best victory will be when I can say to him, and myself months from now that I was serious, and he was wrong for treating me like I lacked self control like he does with weed.\nthatfatdood: This is exactly how those kinds of situations should be handled. You understood that aggression wasn't going to solve your problems, and should be proud of yourself for that.\n\nStay strong! \n\nWhich of the following best characterizes the discourse type of the previous statement?\nA: Question\nB: Answer\nC: Agreement\nD: Disagreement\nE: Appreciation\nF: Elaboration\nG: Humor\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

    "164": "[deleted]: I've got a good half dozen stories I look forward to sharing with this subreddit. Here's a favourite.\n\nIn high school I was friends with this mentally disabled girl (and don't worry this isn't going in the direction you think it is). In the first week of school, I was picked on at the bus-stop. When she saw I was upset, she jumped in and yelled like a mad-woman until I was left alone. I appreciated the gesture, so throughout high-school it developed into a mutual watching of each other's backs.\n\nThis went on for some years, until she started to get used to getting her own way around other people. That she could manipulate people with lies and sob stories. When she found these tactics didn't get any sympathy from me, she started to take it out on me. There was nothing much I could do when she would yell at me, pinch, hit or throw things at me. I would ignore her, and she would get angrier at me.\n\n\"Why are you making me upset?\" She would ask. I would calmly tell her \"I think you're upset because you're treating your friends badly.\" Cue more fists and screams, and one day a teacher coming up to me and blaming me for picking a fight with this girl.\n\n\"Fray Joker! I expected much better behavior from you than to pick fights with a special needs student. Go stand over there until your bus comes, you should be ashamed of yourself.\"\n\nThis teacher was legendary for thinking less of students, for being a real power-tripping authoritative muscle drone. It was not possible to for her to be wrong when it was her word against another student.\n\nI looked this simple beast in the eye and said \"I am not in the wrong here, and you will apologise for what you've said to me.\" I swear at the time she laughed it off, rolled her eyes. And I knew. I knew that she would apologise.\n\nSo started my campaign. Every single time I saw her, walked past her in the corridor, saw her standing on duty. Any time I had to interact with little miss superiority complex, I looked her in the eye and said simply \"You still owe me an apology.\"\n\nIt took three months for this academic dictator to take umbrage at my continued disrespect towards her. Before she finally snapped and yelled at me to \"meet her in her office\". Head held high I walked in to find her sitting at her desk, hands folded, doing her best to kill me with her pure unbridled fury, detention pad at the ready. I looked her in the eye and said \"You owe me an apology.\" \n\nShe asked me why, and I explained the incident to her. How this girl decided to pick a grudge against me, and how I was trying my best to teach her sympathy towards others. She accused me of going over this girl's head. I pointed out that we had been friends for years, and she always used to be compassionate to others. I told her that her assumption I was in the wrong deeply insulted me, that I would never bully or hurt another student in the school. She admitted that she had never heard a complaint against me from any student or teacher.\n\nWithout another argument left in her, she said sorry, I said thankyou, and walked out of her office.\n\n**TL;DR** Teacher told me unicorns don't exist, I put LSD in her coffee and set a horse loose in her office.\nbompbompimabus: I expected awesome story of unicorn LSD tripping.\nI am still pleasantly surprised.

For those that didn't see, he's now swamped [with everything](http://www.reddit.com/r/NASCAR/comments/1x7erz/17_days_until_the_daytona_500/cf90mo4), so he will no longer be doing them. It's crazy to think we're just over 2 weeks away from the 500. I've been following this series pretty regularly and thought the winter would take forever when Methfield started way back when with his half-assery.\n\nAnd with all apologies to Mr. Methfield, the rest of these numbers are too good to be half-assed. :-)\n\nI've already started on the #15 to post Saturday. If anyone wants the #14 or #13 claim them here, or else I will be happy to continue.\n\n\n**----History of the #16----**\n\n\n**[Bill Snowden](http://i.imgur.com/rm8C2z3.jpg)** - 1949-1952 - Snowden made 18 starts in the 16, including the very first sanctioned NASCAR \"Strictly Stock\" race at Charlotte Speedway in 1949. I'm pretty sure this picture is from 1948 when NASCAR only had a \"modified\" division.\n\n**Tiny Lund** - 1956-1957, 1968 - Lund started 12 races in 1956 and 1 in 1957 to mixed results. He came back to the #16 in 1968 driving for Bud Moore.\n\n**[Glen Wood](http://i.imgur.com/xVr5bAR.jpg)** - 1959-1960 - Wood only had 10 starts in the #16, but won 3 races in 1960 with it. Interestingly enough all 3 at Bowman Gray Stadium. He was inducted into NASCAR Hall of Fame in 2012.\n\n**Joe Weatherly** - 1960-1961 - Weatherly only had 3 starts in the #16, but 1 win at the Charlotte Fairgrounds in 1961. We'll talk more about Joe when we get to the #8.\n\n**---Bud Moore Era---**\n\n**[Darel Dieringer](http://i.imgur.com/wrve6UU.jpg)** - 1963-1966 - Dieringer made 52 starts in the #16 winning 5 races. The biggest of which was the 1966 Southern 500.\n\nIn 1967 Bud Moore had 5 different drivers start 16 races. These drivers were **[Bobby Allison](http://i.imgur.com/TFdUtgC.jpg)**, **Sam McQuagg**, **Gordon Johncock**, **Cale Yarborough** and **LeeRoy Yarbrough** (who aren't related).\n\n**[Tiny Lund](http://i.imgur.com/pEoaR6D.jpg)** - 1968 - Lund started 13 races in 1968 under the #16, to again mixed results.\n\nWe'll learn a lot more about Bud Moore tomorrow.\n\nCompletely off topic, while I was googling I came across this [1970 Boss 302 Mustang](http://i.imgur.com/a7baCKK), which is absolutely gorgeous. Apparently it was raced in the 1970 Trans-Am Season.\n\nMore info here -  http://www.historictransam.com/Drivers/RossMyers70Mustang16.html\n\n\nFrom 1969 to 1971 no drivers had more than 2 starts in the #16, until it was resurrected full time in 1972 by...\n\n**---Roger Penske Era--**\n\n**[Mark Donohue](http://i.imgur.com/zacoNFo.jpg)** - 1972-1973 - He only had 6 starts, but he made the most of them winning a 1973 race at Riverside with the famous AMC Matador. He also won the 1972 Indy 500 for Penske.\n\n**Dave Marcis** and **Gary Bettenhausen** also drove the #16 in 1972 and 1974, but they are better known for other numbers (Marcis) and racing series (Bettenhausen).\n\n**[Bobby Allison](http://i.imgur.com/r4MW6BW.jpg)** - 1975 - Yet another number for Bobby Allison, he made 19 starts in the #16 in 1975, with 3 wins\n\n**[Rusty Wallace](http://i.imgur.com/R5Ies3n.jpg)** - 1980 - Penske took a chance on a young 23 year old Rusty Wallace, giving him his first 2 starts of his career. He finished 2nd in his first ever start at Atlanta. \n\nPenske took an 11 year hiatus from NASCAR, before coming back in 1991 with Rusty and the #2. More on that in a few weeks.\n\n\nBacktracking my timeline a bit..\n\n**[David Sisco](http://i.imgur.com/9300cdv.jpg)** - 1977 - Sisco started 10 races in the #16 as an owner/driver after spending the majority of his career in the #05. The results were lackluster to say the least.\n\n\n**[David Pearson](http://i.imgur.com/Kzyy51u.jpg)** - 1981-1984 - Toward the end of his career the Silver Fox piloted the #16 for 25 races in the 80s, getting 7 top 10s.\n\n**[Morgan Shepherd](http://i.imgur.com/uxXk2Hg.jpg)** - 1985 - I wasn't going to put this one here, since he only had 4 starts, but I liked this picture far more than I should have.\n\n**[Larry Pearson](http://i.imgur.com/YOHd6AM.jpg)** - 1987-1990 - Larry looked to be one of the next up and comers, winning back to back then Busch Series championships in 1986 and 1987, but could not translate that to success in Cup, eventually washing out and going back to the Busch Series for most of the 90s.\n\n\n**---Jack Roush Era---**\n\n**[Wally Dallenbach, Jr.](http://i.imgur.com/55F1XkF.jpg)** - 1992-1993 - Roush picked up Dallenbach to start a 2nd car in his garage with Mark Martin. He wasn't that good with Roush, only having moderate success on the road courses in 59 total starts in the #16.\n\n**Ted Musgrave** - 1994-1998 - Ted could never put together all the pieces to win a race, despite being so close so many times. 16 top 5's in 145 total starts in the #16.\n\n[94/95 Family Channel](http://i.imgur.com/zGAv8DN.jpg)  \n[96/97 Family Channel/Primestar](http://i.imgur.com/oViTXcg.jpg)  \n\n**Kevin Lepage** - 1998-2000 - Lepage took over for Musgrave halfway through the 1998 season, and was just absolutely dreadful for his tenure in the #16. I don't know if it's possible to be washed up before you even make a start, but Kevin might fit the bill here.\n\n[1999 TV Guide](http://i.imgur.com/BVNB2vf.jpg)  \n[2000 FamilyClick.com](http://i.imgur.com/MnhrM7S.jpg)  \n\n**Greg Biffle** - 2002-Present - To put it simply, Biffle is the most successful driver the #16 has ever had, having the most starts (396) and most wins (19). He is one of the most consistent drivers today, and usually good for a win or two a year.\n\n[2003 Grainger](http://i.imgur.com/UMK6jib.jpg)  \n[2004 National Guard](http://i.imgur.com/xWpDrmg.jpg)  \n[2012 3M](http://i.imgur.com/VMuejNt.jpg)   \n\n**--Most Starts in the #16--**  \n396 - Greg Biffle  \n145 - Ted Musgrave  \n79 - Kevin Lepage  \n59 - Wally Dallenbach, Jr.  \n52 - Darel Dieringer  \n39 - Larry Pearson  \n26 - Tiny Lund  \n25 - David Pearson  \n24 - Bobby Allison  \n18 - Bill Snowden  \n(80 drivers with 10 or less starts)  \n**--1041 Total Starts in the #16, by 90 Drivers--**\n\n**--Most Wins in the #16--**  \n19 - Greg Biffle  \n5 - Darel Dieringer  \n3 - Glen Wood  \n3 - Bobby Allison  \n1 - Joe Weatherly  \n1 - Mark Donohue  \n**--32 Total Wins in the #16, by 6 Drivers--**\ndookiecat: Nice work, appreciated  \n\nWhich of the following best characterizes the discourse type of the previous statement?\nA: Question\nB: Answer\nC: Agreement\nD: Disagreement\nE: Appreciation\nF: Elaboration\nG: Humor\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

    "169": "morbo2000: I saw the far off pearly white glow of the planet nestled in the inky blackness of deep space.  I knew it was a planet because the first thing you learn in astronomy is that if it does not sparkle it is not a star.  So beautiful...glowing like a jewel in the cosmos.  Am I looking through a telescope?  Why is Jason here?  He is not in my astronomy class.  He's an art school dropout.\n\n\"Dude wake up!  C'mon he's chasing the guy!  Let's go!\", urged Jason helping me up.  I looked around and keeled over.  My balance was shot.  Sky, trees, grass and park all rolled past me as my head wobbled.\n\nJason dragged me down the path.  I left a trail of blood on the ground from my nose.  Dot.  Dot.  Dot.\n\n\"What happened?\", I asked.\n\n\"Well he took your money if that's what you mean.  I told you to put it in your boot\", said Jason pulling me through the bushes to a sidewalk and then across a street.  \n\nThere were people here.  They stared at us.  In the reflection of a Cinzano's Cafe I saw my face.  My nose was puffy looking and blood oozed out.  The guy eating an egg and pickled peppers sandwich inside looked at me with disgust so we kept walking.\n\n\"Do you really think that guy was a cop?\", I asked.  My voice sounded funny and thick.\n\n\"Lets hope not\", muttered Jason as he lit a cigarette and helped me down the entrance to the BART station.\n\n\"Man this sucks!\", said Jason puffing away angrily.\n\n\"Yeah\", I agreed, \"but at least we got away.  And maybe my nose isn't broken...\"\n\n\"Not your nose!  The fucking heroin man!  We got nothing!\"\n\nI made a mental note not to share any painkillers with Jason that I might get from the school doctor and got on the escalator.  Jason jogged down the stairs and the wind from the train tunnels lifted his hair and jacket into the air like wings.  I leaned against the railing of the escalator and held my swollen nose. \n\nStudents of my university try really hard to look gritty and urban.  It's the effect of this city.  Like a giant pulsating heart, the city takes in ideas and personalities and pumps them through it's vast historical chambers.  Like a virus, this alters the very DNA of the idea and molds it to fit into the culture of the city.  This place changes you.  But the people who grew up in the city can always spot the students.\n\nStudents look a little too healthy.  They glow brighter with nicer teeth and wear expensive mall clothes.  Students also make easy targets because most students have money.\n\nWe were on the other side of the park.  Not the side where the students played frisbee or where the mother's pushed their baby strollers.  We were on the side were the unwashed masses of homeless kids clashed with the crazies, the pyschos and the drug addicts.  We passed a restroom where a wall had been transformed into an informational board.  All these pictures of missing kids with heartfelt messages to call home.\n\n\"Fuck you hear those stories about how someone is preying on homeless kids in this park?\", asked Jason as we strolled beneath towering redwood trees that swooshed and swayed beneath a clear blue sky.\n\n\"Yeah they found a kid tied to a tree with his throat cut last weekend.  Somewhere 'round here...\", I answered looking at pictures of all the missing kids.    \n\nWe walked towards the fountain where people congregate.  The smell of ganja and patchouli oil wafted from a crowd of people with shopping carts, sleeping bags and dogs.  They looked like psychedelic gypsies.  \n\n\"How are we gonna do this?\", I asked.  I had never walked up to a stranger and asked for heroin.\n\n\"Easy\", said Jason.  \"Just need to find a junkie and ask him or her.  Too many hippies here though.  Lets try down there.\"\n\n\"Ok...\"\n\nWe walked through the park and found some older homeless guys on a bench.  \n\n\"Bingo!\", smiled Jason, \"notice the soda?  Not beer?  This guy likes H.\"  Jason strolled up to the men who stared coldly at us.\n\n\"You guys know where to score any H?\" asked Jason loudly.\n\n\"Man get the fuck out of here!\", yelled the man and he threw his soda at Jason.\n\n\"Whoa!  Sorry sir! \", said Jason and then to me, \"Lets get out of here!\"\n\nWe hurried away but another guy followed us so we stopped.  A middle aged guy drinking a beer.\n\n\"I can hook you up.  What are you looking for?\", he said.\n\n\"Bundles.  Would love to make a volume deal...how much can you get us?\", smiled Jason.\n\n\"I can get 10 maybe 12 right now...\", the guy said carefully, \"but I need the cash first.\"\n\n\"Nope\", I said feeling very street savvy, \"we need to see it before we pay...\"\n\n\"Ok\", the guy said fishing out a handful of bundles from inside his jacket, \"Now show me some cash.  These are $65...\"\n\n\"$65?\", repeated Jason incredulously.\n\nAs they argued I watched a guy who looked like he was an office worker out for a stroll.  But he walked too fast and right up to us.  As he walked by he suddenly lunged at the dealer and grabbed his hand knocking bundles everywhere.\n\n\"What-!\", yelled the dealer.  The guy held out a hand and pointed at us and held his other hand behind his back near his waistband.\n\n\"I am police officer!  All of you freeze!\"\n\nSo we stood there.  But shock turned to fear as he pulled out a gun and pointed it at us while walking forward.  The dealer took one step back and CRACK! -the guy swung the gun like a club right into the dealer's face.  The blow instantly staggered the dealer who collapsed.  A tooth bounced in front of my boots.\n\n\"Empty your pockets boys!\", the guy said as he stooped down and started grabbing bundles.\n\nThen I did a foolish thing.  A very foolish thing that explains why my nose is crooked.  I stood up for myself against a man with a gun.\n\n\"Can we see your badge?\", I asked politely.  \n\nHe stared at me, uncocked the gun and put it back in the holster very casually.  He glanced around the park and turned towards me with a smile.  I never saw the punch.\n\nThen I was lying on my back staring at Jason's concerned face.  I wondered if he knew what planet that was orbiting above us in the heavens?\n\n\"Dude wake up!  C'mon he's chasing the guy!  Let's go!\", urged Jason helping me up.  I looked around and keeled over.  My balance was shot.  Sky, trees, grass and park all rolled past me as my head wobbled.\nDope_AFchi: Awesome!! \n\nWhich of the following best characterizes the discourse type of the previous statement?\nA: Question\nB: Answer\nC: Agreement\nD: Disagreement\nE: Appreciation\nF: Elaboration\nG: Humor\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

Same behavioral problem, and fired again. I forced him into addiction treatment at the Hazleden Institute, which he strenuously resisted. He managed to get another job in an auto shop in Phoenix, and lasted 14 months before he was fired again. He never tried to find work again, and became a total social isolate, communicating only with his WoW \"friends\". He certainly had underlying problems of mental illness and substance abuse. But I'm convinced that WoW was a significant contributor to his death. He died of a self inflicted shotgun wound to the head on October 14, 2013, after he had run out of his savings and was facing eviction from his $350 per month apartment.\nsexaholic345: I am so sorry for your loss.

    "197": "[deleted]: Recently, I have gotten interested in worlds consisting of infinite flat planes. yes, I know I would have to get rid of space exploration and all that goes with it, but having a world like this would mean that there would be infinite land exploration, the frontier never ends,  empires could could stretch farther than they ever could on earth. Life would evolve in isolated pockets on the plane, and things from entirely different evolutionary trees could end up meeting.\n\nI'm the kind of person who needs an explanation for these kind of things, even if it is just hand waving and pseudoscience. so here is my explanation for my world:\n\nFirst, I need a way for the universe to actually form in a way that creates such a plane. here is how I explain it:\n\nFirst imagine a world with 2d space, and have it folded so it produces a crease. It would end up looking like this:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/IQSOKrt\n\nmatter would be attracted toward the crease and form a line down the middle. \n\nNow, lets do the same with 3D space, and folding it through a fourth dimension. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/fEYFXol\n\nThis would create a 2D \"crease\" which would attract matter to form a plane. This requires the assumption that matter only responds to gravity, but doesn't create it, or it would collapse into spheres which would be attracted towards the crease. I couldn't find a way to get around it, so i'm just taking away matter induced gravity. \n\nNow that we have our plane, lets find a way to make it habitable. obviously, we can't have traditional suns, so we have to have something else. here is what I came up with: \n\n\"Due to the contorted nature of the universe, there is what seems like a wall of light and heat emanating from above the plane. The heat and light is actually a portal to another universe caused by part this universe, poking into the other, where the amount zero point energy is enough to heat the plane up to a habitable temperature. The geometry of the portal means that the emissions are on average spread evenly, but there are areas where temperatures are low enough for heat to radiate away, as well as areas that are hotter than normal, creating massive amounts of convection. Only the areas between these zones are habitable, as the warm zones are scoured clean by perpetual rain from huge cumulonimbus clouds, and the cold zones are freezing wastelands.\" \n\nYou may be asking about how all of the materials got here. this is probably my biggest piece of hand waving and nonsense yet. I got the idea from quantum mechanics. Given an infinite amount of time, quantum fluctuations could cause anything to appear. In this version of the universe, a specific proportion of elements spontaneous appeared which sorted out by density and chemical reactions until the plane formed, much like early earth but completely flat.\n\nEdit: If the quantum fluctuations didn't turn out like this, the story wouldn't be about the universe where it didn't. it would be about one that did.  \n\nThat is the story of the beginning of my world, it probably wont be to important to the history of nations and such, but I think explanations are an important part of a world.  \n\n\ngeorgepennellmartin: It's a great idea. I've always liked the idea of a flatworld. Fantasy demands a higher scope than the surface area of a single meagre planet. I had the idea of a fantasy setting on the inside of a dyson sphere with an area 500 million times greater than the surface of the earth.

After I made my last thread, I PM'd a member here who I felt would actually listen to anything I had to say. I asked them why I felt so strongly about this and they suggested I speak with a professional. So, I went to talk to someone before the holiday break and I just finished another session with them earlier today. Since I don't intended on keeping this person long term, I pretty much laid out everything that I've been going through and about my behavior here. Although nothing is set in stone, he believes that I may be experiencing something called Black and White thinking (or Splitting as it's properly called). I was projecting what I felt was \"wrong\" onto others and I separated myself from others. At times I felt that everyone else was wrong and I was right (that's what you all saw in my posts) and at times I felt that I was the wrong one because I was the only one who felt this way, therefore everyone else was right.

    "209": "YourRegularJoe94: (First submission! Let me know if you like it! If so, I'll write more!)\n\nDoctor Who Episode 1 (Prologue)\n\nIt was a quiet night in my dingy little apartment. I had the night off from work and, as opposed to being the social butterfly my parents had always wanted, I found myself lazily flicking through the channels on the tv, my tee shirt speckled with bits of each meal I had eaten throughout the day. So things were going great. \n   \nAfter several minutes of surfing the channels, finding nothing that struck my interest, I put it on the news and grabbed the book I had been reading from the coffee table, turning to the dog-eared page and sighing as the anchorwoman droned on in the background. I kept catching bits of the news as I turned the pages. \"....World Cup bid.....tension building in Middle East.....clean water initiative....\" \n   \nAs I turned the page, the lights flickered. I raised my head, wondering if I'd forgotten to pay the electricity bill, at which point I was plunged into darkness. \"Yup....way to go Jane,\" I said aloud. I sighed, getting up off the couch and slowly, carefully made my way to the kitchen, opening a cabinet and getting out a flash light, clicking it on and moving the beam across the dark, empty apartment. And in the darkness, the silence deafening, I kinda wished I was the social butterfly my parents had wanted. Perhaps then, I wouldn't be standing here alone, food and sweat stains covering my shirt. \n   \nSeeing as I had no power, I decided it would be best to go out tonight. I went upstairs to my bedroom and tried my best to assemble an outfit in the darkness, the flashlight not providing nearly enough light for me to do my makeup. I hoped and prayed I wouldn't end up looking like a clown as I got ready, putting on what I assumed were blue jeans and a basic white tee shirt. \n   \nAs I slipped my black and white Chucks on, I begin to hear a sound in my backyard. It was a low sound at first but it got increasingly loud, like some great mechanical beast wheezing. As the sound grew to a crescendo, I looked out the window into the backyard at which point the lone tree in my backyard was blown to smithereens, a flash of blue all I saw before I shielded my eyes. Then all was silent again. \n   \nI cautiously peeked out the window and saw, of all things, a police box sitting in the remains of the tree, brilliant orange and yellow light pouring out of the windows. I ran downstairs to the patio doors and flashed the beam of the light out onto the police box, smoke coming off of it. I opened the doors and quietly stepped out into the dark. \n   \n\"My god,\" I said as I surveyed the damage. Branches and leaves lie scattered all around the yard, but I was paying more attention to the box in the tree. The orange and yellow light was no longer pouring out of the windows, but smoke poured out of the crack between the doors. Suddenly, the doors were thrown open and someone fell out, hitting the ground with a groan and a thud. I gasped, flashing my beam on them. It was a man, his clothes in tatters. I frantically fished my phone out of my pocket to dial 911 and frowned as I found it was turned off. \"Weird...\" I thought. I cautiously stepped towards the man, his short, dark red hair blowing softly in the wind. \n\"A-are you okay sir?\" I asked. He groaned in response. I stepped closer and kneeled, turning him over, shocked to find that despite his clothes being all but destroyed, his face appeared fine. He had a thick red beard, one that hadn't been shaved in several days. His ivory skin was almost too intense to flash the beam of light on. His dark green eyes slowly opened and then, seeing me, they shot open. \n   \nHe jumped up with surprising dexterity for a man who'd just suffered a terrible crash. He looked at me and then began examining himself, making sure he was uninjured. I stood there frozen, unable to speak. Satisfied that he was okay, the man turned towards the police box in the tree. \"You have got to be kidding me,\" he said in a thick Scottish accent. He turned towards me. \"Can you believe this?!\" he said incredulously, gesturing to the box. I really couldn't. He sighed. \"Well, that's just great.\" He turned toward me again, his eyes narrowing. \"Why do you keep doing that? I don't like it,\" he said. \n   \n\"Wh-what are you talking about?\" I managed to say. \n\"That blurry thing. You're all fuzzy! It really is very distracting.\" He turned back towards the box. \"Oh, not you too!\" he shouted at it. He walked over to me, his long, thin legs carrying him to me in seconds. \"I need your car blur person.\" \n\"F-for what?\" I asked, still not sure if I was dreaming. \"Need to get the TARDIS out of the tree.\" \n\"T-TARDIS?\" \n\"Oh, for God's sake! Can you manage a single bloody sentence without stammering?!\" That made me mad. \n\"Hey, you're the one who crashed into my backyard,\" I yelled. He looked surprised at that. \n\"Backyard? Where are we? When are we?\" \n\"What are you, daft?\" I said. \"New York City, 2015. \n\"If we're in New York City in 2015,\" he said, \"then why are there no lights for miles around?\" He asked. And for the first time, I noticed that it wasn't just my apartment. The city was dark as far as the eye could see. \"My god...\" I said. I turned back towards the man, but he wasn't there. I whirled around to see his slender legs disappearing into my open patio doors. I ran after him. \"Hey! You can't just barge into people's homes like that!\" I said. He seemed to be paying me no attention. He was examining his reflection in the hallway mirror, making cartoonish expressions at himself. \n   \n\"Well, could've been worse I suppose,\" he said. \"Although I wish I wasn't so blurry.\" He whirled around to me. \"So, ready to give me those car keys?\" he asked. \n   \n\"Oh no, no way. First of all, I don't even know who you are! Second, you're in no shape to drive. You can't even see clearly!\" \n   \nHe frowned at me and then held up one long, thin finger. \"I'm the Doctor.\" He added another digit, his fingers forming a peace sign. \"I suppose you're right. Never actually learned to drive....can you help me?\" I stared at him for a second, mulling over whether or not he could be trusted, his emerald eyes staring into mine. \n  \n\"Okay,\" I finally said. His face lit up. \"Great!\" he said, walking back towards the patio. \"This way\" I said, pulling him by the collar. He turned and we exited the apartment. \nPyrotic8696: This is great.

    "211": "AnteaterTango: I want to thank you folks.  Venturing into polyamory from being in nonmonogamous unlabeled *things*... forced me to open better communication with the people I feel very deeply about.  \n\n\nI met (A) in a courtyard where someone had knit sweaters for the trees, and hung origami from the branches.  I fell in harmony with his charm, his sexual confidence, the Arabic music that played when he started his car.  We kissed in comic book stores, referenced math to talk about art while we walked hand in hand by the river or giggled and sang while we made dinner together.  \n\n\nIn the early days of being with (A), the only way I knew how to express, \"do you care about me,\" was \"Do you want to be exclusive.\"  Which he shirked, said that wasn't how he was, and wanted to move on.  After soul searching and entirely within myself, I chose to interpret his emotions for me in his actions, and I felt secure (ish) when I saw how he treated me, how we laughed together, how kind and thoughtful he always was.  Dates, bringing me bouquets of wildflowers, or playing music for me, public hand holding and kisses, massages and deep conversations, poetry... months turning into years..  meeting his family and him meeting mine, it all meant romance to me, and emotional commitment.  I felt emotionally nourished, fulfilled, happy with him and us.  \n\n\nBut I was uncomfortable not knowing the rest of his life- I never knew about his other partners, he never talked about his feelings toward me or anyone else, even when I asked.  \n\n\nComing to this sub along with reading the morethantwo website, I realized really how lacking my communication had always been, and you all have helped me not only figure out the roots of my own emotions, but helped me ask the right questions of my partners, listen more fully to their needs, and realize when more communication is necessary.  \n\n\nI finally was able to ask the right questions of (A).  In a list of questions that I thought were meant to comfort me, I asked if he felt romantically toward me.  He said with a thoughtful 'uhm' that no.  He sees our relationship as a \"sexual friendship.\" I felt shocked and betrayed.  Misled.  I wanted to call him childish and selfish for 'leading me on.' Mismatch between what he felt and I interpreted.. layed out so clearly after all this time misreading it, hurt me deeply, and I wanted to blame him.   Still it dawned on me, *I had never asked that question of him ever before.*  \n\n\nThe frustrating thing looking back is... it wasn't even a breakup, it was a clarification of what always was.  For him nothing has changed, and for me, I feel like I've lost a yearslong romantic relationship.  The beautiful way that I felt is over, and I am glad now that I know.  \n\n\nBeing in a nonexclusive loving (for me) relationship with him, I learned it was possible and healthy for me to have ethical, loving feelings and interactions with multiple people.  He shaped my sexuality and my sexual morals so so much, in wonderful ways that I hope will always be with me.  \n\n\nTLDR: Thank you all for helping me recognize the communication a good relationship needs.  I feel brokenhearted, but I know what is, and I'm able to move on.  Thank you all <3\nBlueBerryJazz: Thank you for sharing. I'm sorry for your hurt.

But, after suffering from the same manufacturing problems multiple times and now their refusal for (yet another) replacement, my wife and I are done with Fitbits.\n\nI'm mainly posting this for people who are interested in getting the unit - please consider your usage and whether or not you will run into the same problems.\n\n* Original Charge HR: After ~2 months, the charging port came off when unplugging from the cable (stayed attached to the cable).  That was weird.  Support immediately sent out a replacement.\n\n* 1st replacement: Material on band/face of unit bubbled up and then peeled away.  Support immediately sent out a replacement after recommending that the unit be wiped down/cleaned after heavy workouts.\n\n* 2nd replacement - Followed support directions regarding cleaning but ran into same exact issue.  [Here is a picture that I just took](http://i.imgur.com/zVr75Kp.jpg) so you know what I'm talking about.  Support will not replace because I'm now ~400 days since my original purchase, so outside of warranty.  \n\nMy wife is also on her third unit - the first two for the band peeling issue, and the third has just stopped vibrating for alarms and other actions.  They won't replace hers, either, as it was purchased at the same time (late Christmas presents for each other).\n\nThey offered each of us 25% off vouchers for new units, but I find it a hard pill to swallow.  Why would I want to put money towards a product that has proven to fail in our use case?\n\nSo, it seems like if you are looking to use your Charge HR for high-impact/high sweat activities, you may want to steer clear as there is some kind of manufacturing defect with the bands leading to this peeling issue.  If you're just looking to use it more casually, it's pretty awesome and you'll probably be ok.\ndogwalkingrobot: I would honestly pay for one ChargeHR per year without caring too much. \n\nI just enjoy it that much and find it so useful that I'd pay $12 a month for it.

    "233": "tgdm: ##UPDATE!\n\n[I did it](http://i.imgur.com/y6S1uXc.png), so can you!\n\n***\n\nThere are many people asking how to go about this and many people struggling with it. And I get it. It is a rough deal right now. I'll offer two separate paths for you to explore your options with; Solo or Group. But, before we get into that, here is a checklist that you will most likely need to see success. This checklist will be the ideal, not necessarily the requirement.\n\n***\n\n##CHECKLIST\n\nKey:\n\n○ = Orokin Catalyst/Reactor required\n\n◘ = Optional Mod choice\n\n☼ = Strongly Recommended Option\n\nX = Adjust Mod Rank as you see fit\n\n###Archwing Loadout:\n\n* Odonata Rank 30 - [imgur](http://i.imgur.com/YOGOTRe.png)\n\n>Mod List: Argon Plating (Max), Energy Inversion (Max), Enhanced Durability (Max), Auxiliary Power (Max), ◘Superior Defenses (Upgrade x 2)\n\n*Superior Defenses is optional. If you are not using an Orokin Reactor be sure to NOT max rank it.*\n\n* ○Imperator Rank 30 - [imgur](http://i.imgur.com/T60drow.png)\n\n>Mod List: Electrified Barrel (Max), Venomous Clip (Max), Rubedo-Lined Barrel (Max), Modified Munitions (Max), ◘Combustion Rounds (Max), ◘Polar Magazine (X), ◘Dual Rounds (Max)\n\n*Make damn sure the elemental bonus you are getting is Corrosive. Place your mods as shown in the image and you will be fine. If you cannot afford an Orokin Catalyst, stick with Rubedo, Venomous, and Electrified.*\n\n* ○☼Onorix or ○Veritux Rank 30 - [imgur](http://i.imgur.com/CnxGGfL.png)\n\n>Mod List: Cutting Edge (Max), Galvanized Blade (Max), Poisonous Sting (Max), Extend (Max), Glacial Edge (Max), ◘Blazing Steel (Max), ◘Furor (Max), ◘Tempered Blade (Max)\n\n*I forma'd Veritux because I like giant space swords and had to level Corvas anyways. Not necessary. I haven't found a Blazing Steel yet either.*\n\n###Warframe Loadout:\n\n* ○☼Valkyr, ○Rhino (◘○Prime), ○Zephyr, or ○Frost (◘○Prime) Rank 30 - [imgur](http://i.imgur.com/koLSc8a.png)\n\n>Aura List: ☼Rejuvenation (Max), Energy Siphon (Max), or Steel Charge (Max)\n\n>Mod List: Redirection (X), Vigor (Max), Vitality (X), ◘Fast Deflection (Max), ◘Flow (Max), Fortitude (Max), Steel Fiber (X)\n\n*Rejuvenation is your best choice if you are running as Valkyr. While Energy Siphon is very useful, you are much better off with emergency Team Energy Restore consumables. Steel Charge is luxury if the other two auras are already covered in group play. The mods listed are known to 100% work with Archwings and if you have to give up one, give up Fast Deflection and/or Flow. Warframes are listed in order of preference. For more on Warframe stat comparison, check [here](http://warframe.wikia.com/wiki/Warframes_Comparison).*\n\n###Gear Loadout:\n\n* Medium Team Energy Restore\n\n* ☼Medium Team Heal Restore\n\n*These are absolutely necessary for solo play. For more information on Team Restores visit this [page](http://warframe.wikia.com/wiki/Team_Bonus_Consumables). Also: not sure why it's Heal not Health but whatever.*\n\n***\n\n##Strategy: General\n\nThis will be in a simple bullet list format. If there is any confusion or need to elaborate further let me know in the comments.\n\n* Enemy AI will work as thus: When they spawn, they will rush to a random capture point and attempt to begin capturing it. After attempting capture, they will then fly directly towards a player in somewhat single-file. If they encounter another player along these preset paths, they will alter their course and engage the player. Also, if their flight from the point they are capturing to the player is too long, they may reset and return to the point they are capturing.\n\n* Enemies can attack while fast-traveling. This means that you cannot simply sprint away to recover your shields. It also means that Temporal Dregs can catch up to you at any distance and remove your ability to sprint. Enemies also appear to have nearly perfect aim so sprinting away is twice as much not an option without cover.\n\n* Odonata's fourth ability, Repel, will damage and push back enemies, permanently disarming them and also disabling movement for a short time. The duration shown when using this ability is not a cooldown but rather an uptime indicator, meaning you can use it multiple times in succession. This will be your go-to ability.\n\n* Odonata's second ability, Disarray, can be used to confuse enemy missiles. This ability must be used preemptively rather than as a reactionary defense tool. Enemies that come into contact with a flare are briefly stunned. This is a decent way to handle an unfortunate volley of missiles.\n\n* Missiles can be shot down and destroyed, but the damage from Repel will not destroy them. Disarray does not consistently disrupt missiles already in flight.\n\n* Do not melee excessively because that can quickly result in you being bombarded by rockets. Melee when it is safe, use your rifle when you are unsure.\n\n* At the beginning of each round your primary focus should be capturing points. If there are simply too many enemies coming to your current location and you cannot capture as a result, give it up and fly to another. Try to prevent them from capturing it if you can, but don't waste too much time for it.\n\n* Do not worry about keeping 4 points at all times. Sometimes you have to give up a capture point in order to stay alive or clear out some enemies and that is fine. Panic when you only own 1 point. If you managed to get 3-4 points before having to engage in combat at the start, chances are you'll be over 50% completion by the time you lose another capture point.\n\n* You do not have to go to a point that is being captured right away. If the enemy flies to you, kill it. If the enemy is flying back to the point you should then worry about chasing it down. **But regardless you should never stand still for too long.**\n\n\n***\n\n##Strategy: Solo\n\nFirst: set the game mode to Solo so you can pause if need be and not have to worry about unwanted joiners.\n\nI mostly only did this using Rhino or Valkyr so your mileage may vary, but pick the frame you think you would benefit most from. Rhino has an abundance of shields which can be useful, Valkyr has an insane amount of armor which prevents *most* instant-deaths from rockets when you are not able to see/react to them. I would strongly recommend using the Rejuvenation aura for solo play because it is much harder to sit around and use a health restore to recover than it is to drop an energy restore and get 50/100/150 energy to spam Repel with.\n\nAt the beginning of each round you should, for the most part, be worry free and can just focus on capping 3-4 points. If on the off chance the first point you pick is the one the AI zergs to, be prepared to pop an early Energy Restore so that you can #4 (Repel) them away and complete the cap. At the end of each wave, take advantage of the bugged/stuck enemies by using the time to replenish your health and energy if you feel the need. Do not ever sit in one spot too long. If you stop being careful, that will be the exact moment when enemy rockets bombard you from behind and instantly kill you.\n\nMelee is your best option for AoE clears on enemies and is VERY useful against targets which have been repelled and can no longer fight back. Melee is also useful for killing off a single enemy at a time while traveling between points. Melee can 1-2 shot Dregs with the proper loadout. That being said, you will be using your ranged weapon for the vast majority of the mission. Sniping point captures off in the distance for instance, dealing with incoming enemies while kiting.\n\nAnd finally, the most important piece of advice I can offer, do not be afraid to fail a few times. It's one thing to read all of this and it is another to experience it. It might take you a while but you will eventually get used to how the AI works. If you die early on in the first round, forfeit and restart rather than wasting your revives. Consumables are cheap, revives are not. There are definitely many bugs and unfair/unfun mechanics in play right now, but it is still doable if you take advantage of consumables, revives (for emergencies), and sometimes even the bugs.\n\n***\n\n##Strategy: Group\n\n* 1 x Rejuvenation Aura, 1 x Steel Charge Aura, 1 x Energy Siphon Aura, + 1 Steel/Energy Aura\n\n* 4 x Valkyr strongly recommended\n\n* At the start of each mission/round, split up and capture all 4 points. After that, congregate on a single point together.\n\n* Pay attention to the minimap/radar. See 20 red dots? That is the point you guys need to defend. \n\n* When *you* use Repel, keep an eye on any capturing enemies. They will seemingly just teleport randomly for anyone else in your group so it will be up to you to prevent the capture from completing.\n\n* Spam Repel, kill enemies, collect energy orbs, spam Repel some more. Occasionally use Disarray when enemies are incoming.\n\nAside from those bullet points it is essentially the same as solo play. The main difference is that there should be a VERY strong emphasis on killing enemies rather than running point-to-point. I should also make note that communication and teamwork are very important here. If you are the only person at a capture point and there are 10+ enemies inbound, you need to make the judgement call to sit and defend / repel spam or fly away until reinforcements are available. You will get outnumbered if you go alone, you will probably die if you are alone, and if you're worried about looting mod drops that should only matter after the round is done and you are on clean-up duty.\n\n***\n\nI hope this helps you guys out. Elytron is not worth the headache, but if you insist on mashing your face against Uranus (^heheh^heh^hehehhe^hehehahehaheaha \\), hopefully this will help.\n\nIf you have any comments or questions please just throw them below and I'll get to them when I can.\nAlienOvermind: > Steel Charge is luxury if the other two auras are already covered in group play.\n\nI disagree on that. Steel Charge can make a crucial difference between one-shotting enemies with melee and two-shotting them. I'd say it's the best aura for solo play — since you can make up for HP and Energy loss with consumables, but ability to kill enemies faster may save not only your life, but the communication tower too. \n\nWhich of the following best characterizes the discourse type of the previous statement?\nA: Question\nB: Answer\nC: Agreement\nD: Disagreement\nE: Appreciation\nF: Elaboration\nG: Humor\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

    "235": "[deleted]: As I said in an earlier post, I in no way dislike this game. In fact I consider it one of the best games if the devs can manage it to be. I am currently in 1478 MMR according to Agora. I main Kallari and Sevarog. Therefore, in my opinion, the following things have to change.\n\n---IMPORTANT TO AVOID FLAME WARS. I am aware this is early access. this is simply my feedback. Please refrain from flaming, this is an open discussion and let it remain civil. I want Paragon to succeed.-------------------\n\n\n• Travel speed is taking away all the punishment that deathball can cause to your team. If you're deathballing a lane, you can easily travel to another lane way too fast. Punishment should exist if you do not push a lane. This is also the Heroes of the storm syndrome with mounts. It makes the map and the laning phases much less practical and it focuses solely on pvp. Teams with pushing capabilities do not even matter late game.\n\n• Rampage is currently too good at anything. A tank with an escape, a long range stun, an ultimate ability that can hold the ground against a whole team and amazingly good damage if built for it. \n\n• Murdock is by far the most OP Adc in the game. I dont think it's right to be able to 2-3 shot heroes in mid-late game. On top of that, an extremely OP half-across-the map ultimate. I am not sure who thought this is a good idea.\n\n• Muriel has 80% win rate in higher-competitive MMR. Her ultimate is good and it fits the character but being the only support hero, she gives a team advantage that is simply too good at the moment. \n\n• Sevarog is a peel tank, the real problem here is that the pace of higher plays do not involve a great amount of laning without interruptions or not having to defend a deathball. The issue at hand is that Sevarog has never enough time in good MMRs to build over 50-60 stacks. He is only viable by being built as a tank yet he is worse than steel. He is really not a grim reaper. Even if built as damage, he does not excel at it either. I am not sure why Sevarog should be a choice for a team over Steel or Rampage.\n\n• Kallari, being an assassin. Her kit compliments her role but the problem is that in late game there is no way that you can do enough. The only way to play Kallari is to hope you get ahead of XP and rush the pushes. Her problem is that missing the core skills of Dagger or Ultimate is too punishing. She is a glass cannon yes, but most of the time she cannot be worth to her team without her ultimate. Her auto attacks are mediocre and having to hide for 80% of the game is not fun. Another issue with her is what I just said. She is simply not fun. You can get a few kills with her ultimate but against good MMR teams don't expect to be able to do much. On top of that, people with headphones are aware of your pressence which ruins the whole thing. Stealth should not have visibility upgrades but instead with every level of stealth upgrade, you should get movement speed, an attack damage multiplier and critical chance. You should be invisible at all times when in Q. Seriously, this is fucking annoying.\n\n• Gideon, our dark caster is a double edged knife. Sometimes he can be good, sometimes he cannot be anything. He is too much of an unreliable hero. His Ulti roots him, he is squishy as hell and there is no point to actually try to get out of his ulti since you can 3-4 shot him.\n\n• Twinblast, Sparrow. While these are carries too, their kit is pretty normal. The problem like with the carry mentality in late game and design of 'I will 2-4 shot anyone'. \n\n• Iggy and Scorch, not any major issue here other than Turrets can root you if you're in travel mode. Turrets are AI, they should not be able to root you in jungle and in general. \n\n• Armor and Energy armor scaling fail in late game. Building energy or physical resistances currently do not protect anything in late game. Maybe 1-2 shots maximum. This is forcing tanks to build health. Tanks in late game even if built as tanks lose their tank role and become bruisers. This has to be fixed.\n\n• 80 second respawn timer in late game has to go. The pace of the game is different. If I have to wait 80 seconds to spawn, then being 2-3 shotted should not even exist. Needs emergency fix.\n\n• Master skins. I was ready to throw 100 euros to Epic untill I saw the master skins. My Sevarog or Kallari are not flame-based heroes. I play them for their concept. They should have concept-based master skins and not simple recolors with the same art as all other master skins.\n\n• Matchmaking, this is really obvious, but the game is still early access. Do not make the mistake of Heroes of the storm and fix it too late, a community can only wait so long. The problem here is that matchmaking is dependant on two factors in this game. MMR of course but also card distribution. A newbie should not play with me that I can do with 1 card what he can do with 3. \n\n• Deathball five times CXP granted has to go. 5 times extra CXP for your team when you kill an enemy is not a good design. It takes away from the game actually being a Moba.\n\n\n•Critical numbers has to be toned down. It is ridiculous, really. I can see the reason of Kallari having a big crit chance, because she ACTUALLY needs it. But Murdock and twinblast?\n\n•Μana pool should increase with levels.\n\n----\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat EPIC -SHOULD NOT- CHANGE and suggestions-------------\n\n\n• Visually, the characters are great and unique. The physics look great and the overall graphic of the game is excellent. Do not stop making these designs Epic, you're doing great job.\n\n• That 'epic' unreal tournament feel. Massively looking maps, oversized natural trees, huge doors, the electronic music. Gears of war and UT inspired visually characters. Keep that. I love it to the death.\n\n• Do not fall to the fashion of 'cute' characters. Do not give this game anime and 'cute' looking characters. Iggy and Scorch are not cute in my book but they look good. \n\n• Different visual variations of the map but mechanically the same. \n\n• Scalable UI and sound meters for music, master volume, game sound.\n\n• Sevarog's visual upgrades according to his siphon ability looks great. I hope we see more of this.\n\n• Keep making 'cryptic' and dark looking characters. Sevarog, Gideon, Kallari. They all invoke mystery and of course we cant forget how the community lost their shit when you first showed Sevarog. He looks amazingly well designed.\n\n• Variations on the color of skins. Since this is a fully developed HD modelled game, I can imagine making new meshes for skins can take a while. I think you should give recolors for all skins, including affinity colors. Sevarog can be black, dark purple or maybe dark green. etc.\n\n\n\n[deleted]: I honestly don't have the time to explain everything that's wrong with your arguments but want to go on record and state that I completely disagree with everything you said.

The guy caught Brett's record TD pass, he was one of the main reason's we won that Superbowl against the Steelers; take your pick form the 2 touchdowns (one of which he read from their defensive tendencies), the third down conversion, or any of his other contributions as a legit threat on our offense through the years. \n\nSo he went to the Vikes for a bit? \n\nBig fuckin whoop, he made a decision for his family. Best career move? No. But if someone came to you and offered a new job for a comparative pay increase, would you take it? I can guarantee you would, otherwise you are only playing for pride, which face it, in the real world, is useless. This guy is the reason we got a ring that year, and you all are vibing him for the fact he played in purple? Look at yourself before you make these huge judgments, because he is one of our best receivers we've had this decade, and he did everything that he could while he was here, and that deserves our respect. \n\nDo I want him back this year? No. We have a great core of WRs, and he should have the chance to establish himself somewhere else. But to show the kind of disrespect that some people have? Totally inexcusable.  \n\nSo what if he wrote \"Packers Suck.\" on a helmet. Would you want Brian Urlacher to sign a Packers helmet \"Bears Suck\" if you had the chance (not trying to compare Greg to Brian career wise, but the parallel is there)? Guarantee you would. He signed that on a fan request, not some stupid, personal vendetta against the Pack. \n\nGreg, I love you and everything you've done. Hope you can continue a great career in the NFL. \nMundane-ignoramus: I understand giving him his credit, but behavior is something that will ever merit any excuse.

    "248": "JizzOnRainbows: I'm no Mr.Handsome but I like to consider myself slightly below average looking and from my life experience people who are attractive seem to have better lives as far as their sex life, jobs, careers, confidence, and possibly social skills go.  People who are attractive statistically have a slightly better chance of getting out of any sort of legal problems (depending on the severity) than someone who is average or \"ugly\" looking.  Even babies prefer being handled by someone who is attractive even if that person isn't the baby's mom or dad.  I almost got so close to scoring a job working at a restaurant that was going to pay better than the last restaurant I worked in but I didn't get the job because of this sexy busty blonde girl.  I have a lot of experience doing all sorts of things in the restaurant business and I've worked in 3 different successful restaurants and this girl was fresh out of high school and looks so clueless.  It's funny how life works that way.\nirishninjachick: I disagree. For *all*physically attractive people, it is not the case. It is only for those who know how to *take advantage* of their physical features. \n\nSay you have a very well-respected girl who has a body like a victoria secret model, perfect bone structure, hair from the shampoo commercials, ect. She is very intelligent from her own hard-working studies. She enjoys doing the best she can instead of slacking off and getting away with it. \n\nLet's say she has the same job as you. No one will take *her* seriously, because *clearly* she *must* have used her looks to get that position. All of her hard work? She had it *easy*. Even though she did everything required, perhaps even beyond that was required. Everything she says isn't taken seriously because she's just this beautiful barbie doll that deserves to be a model in Paris instead a business woman. People disrespect her. Guys at work grab her ass, give her things she *does not* want while they also expect her to give affection in return. Everyone underestimates her. She is only seen as a sexual object.\n\nMeanwhile, in high school, all the guys only wanted to *fuck* her-or they had this fantasise idea of who she really is-and she's not that person. She would go on countless date after date and end up heartbroken because no one cared to get to know the *real* her. All they cared about was the outer appearance. People would gossip about how her breasts *must* be fake. How she is such a whore because only whores have beautiful bodies like that. Guys would degrade her ever being, even though she was top in class, always respectful. Meanwhile, she would go group-to-group of female friends because all the girls were catty towards her. They would compare their bodies to her, always be watching and pointing any slight flaw to make themselves look better. They would talk about how *real* women have curves. They would get jealous if a guy was paying attention to her over them-and she didn't even want that attention! When she tried befriending nicer people, they would use her-once again. All anyone wanted out of her was eyecandy. None of them wanted to truly get to know her-care about her-she was just someone to idolize and fawn over. Someone to be jealous of. The only reason why guys would befriend her was in hopes of dating her, and they would turn their backs on her once she stated she wasn't interested in a relationship. HS involved getting constantly attacked, degraded, and used-it was very lonely. \n\nConstantly, this girl needs to fear being sexually assaulted, raped, and/or taken advantage of. She has no one to trust. She doesn't get things easily since all these people giving it to her just want to use her.

Not because they had all the stats, but for the fact that they posted the real in game rating of IF players. \n\nI first noticed this when researching the first IF that Miroslav Klose got this year. It just seemed that there was no possible way that an 84 rated striker could have 99 finishing, 94 heading, and 97 jumping. Something was off. Turns out that when you edit Klose's stats in \"edit player\" to match his in form card, the result is a striker with a rating of 89!\n\nBeing able to consult Futguide.com to find this out for all IF players was really cool. We pay big premiums for the stat upgrades that go with In Form and TOTY/S cards. What are we really paying for? This site answered that question! Then the blogger stopped posting after TOTW 31.

I'll show what their ratings were on their cards, vs what they actually are in game with the new stats.\n\nBold players are the \"best buys\"\n\nItalic players are the opposite.\n\nBPL\n\n**TOTS Benteke 81 -> 87**\n\nTOTS Cazorla  89 -> 92\n\nTOTS Michu    84 -> 85\n\n**TOTS Arteta   85 -> 89**\n\nTOTS RVP      93 -> 95\n\n**TOTS Suarez  91 -> 95**\n\nTOTS Vertonghen 87 -> 90\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nSerie A\n\n\n**TOTS Diamanti 85 -> 89**\n\n**TOTS Cavani 92 -> 96**\n\n*TOTS El Shaarawy 88 ->86*\n\nTOTS Vidal 89 -> 91\n\nTOTS Hamsik 91 -> 92\n\nTOTS Campagnaro 87 -> 90\n\nTOTS Barzagli 89 -> 92\n\nTOTS Di Natale 92 -> 94\n\nTOTS Lamela 85 -> 87\n\nTOTS Balotelli 89 -> 93\n\nTOTS Marchetti 89 -> 89\n\nTOTS Buffon 92 -> 92\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nOther TOTS cards\n\nTOTS Mertens 86 -> 88\n\nTOTS Aubameyang 85 -> 88\n\nTOTS Donovan 86 -> 87\n\nTOTS Vela 84 -> 86\n\n*TOTS Reus 91 -> 91*\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nNotable IF cards\n\n\n**IF Klose  84 -> 89**\n\nIF Balotelli 85 -> 89\n\nIF Aquilani 81 -> 85\n\n**IF Higuain 87 -> 92**\n\n**IF Eto'o 86 -> 91**\n\n**IF Matri 81 -> 86**\n\n**IF Gilardino 80 -> 86**\n\nIF Pizarro 84 -> 89\n\n**IF Cavani 87 -> 92**\n\nIF Lukaku 74 -> 80\n\nIF Russell 74 -> 80\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nSo I didn't get to do all of them, and yes I do have an affinity to Serie A.  But I found this to have some rather interesting implications.\n\nThe first being that EA is blatantly lying to us about the ratings of the vast majority of IF and TOTS cards. I'm not sure what that means, but it is a definite fact. Most are heavily underrated. TOTS Cavani is a FUCKING 96 and costs under 500K!(even if his work rates make that ability a total waste) Some, like El Shaarawy (who is absolutely a blast to use btw) is rated an 85! TOTS Reus is disappointingly exactly the same as what his card says.\n\nThe second being that if the handicap does in fact exist, if it works off of comparing team ratings, this could be a brilliant way to get around it. That is if it does exist. The fact that EA lies to us on such a regular basis and prevents all discussion of handicap/scripting on their forums makes me thing that these elements do in fact exist.\n\nAlso, I think it is cool to think that you can have an 87 Cavani or Higuain that is actually a 92 in game. Feeling like you're beating the system is always kind of fun.\n\nThat being said, we all know that player ratings are kind of a stupid way to judge players in this game. Pace is probably the most important stat in a practical sense, yet I find that it doesn't really determine much when it comes to player ratings by this game. \n\nTruth be told, use players that are the most fun to use. But I'm interested in these things, so I figured I'd show you all what I found out.\nSonnyTheMoon: They aren't \"lying\" about players ratings. They put them lower so they have higher card weight and they can't upgrade a players rating too much from where they began. Think of 74 rated in forms. Often their in game stats would have them be a gold player but they rate them 74 so they stay silver. It's the same thing here. \n\nWhich of the following best characterizes the discourse type of the previous statement?\nA: Question\nB: Answer\nC: Agreement\nD: Disagreement\nE: Appreciation\nF: Elaboration\nG: Humor\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

After killing my bestie, I went there in my \"PVP\" gear and lost it all to multiple moving headshots.  Full Kevlar with 5 slot M4 vs guy in Leather with a pistol.  He was unstoppable. Nobody on the server was talented enough to kill him. Mods checked him out, not hacking. Just good.\n\nUnfortunately (for me) the end game currently has sort of a competitive FPS feel to it.  I personally DO NOT want this game to have that kind of feel. I like the craft-able \"Rust\" weapons.  I like the slow and steady crouching in the bushes.  I like organized, slow, careful attacks.  Not jumping up and no aim headshots.  It doesn't feel like what this game is supposed to be.\n\nThere are enough CODs in the world. Rust doesn't need to be another one.\n\nAlso, these always seem to be the same type of players that yell racist bullshit at you while they engage.\n\n\nEDIT: Good arguments, I guess I have to accept the fact that this game leans heavily on the FPS aspect and if I want to compete, I have to get better at the gunplay.\n\n\nGreen_Machine7: I hear what you're saying OP, but you should have avoided this area when you knew there was a high-skilled fps'er there. No matter how they change the shooting mechanics and guns in this game, there will always be people who master it to a ridiculous degree. Your job is to figure out how to counterplay them in your own way, and that is the beauty of Rust. \n\nAKA, if you could redo that situation. You could have:\n\nRallied people on the server for help, set an ambush nearby in an area he may go to after leaving his current area, had your friend run up and distract him naked while you move in for the kill, tried to sneak up on the area and get a few good shots in on him since you had the superior weapon, try to ally with him or diplomatically try to get yours and your friends' stuff back, trickery, or simply just avoided the area altogether and farmed/looted somewhere else.

    "268": "LeoWattenberg: While you may get some more views and potentially a couple of new subscribers that way, you’re losing on another front: Audience retention/Watch time.\n\nPeople combing through self-promotion threads/communities are a rare thing (especially since these places turn into link dumps if the mods aren’t paying attention), but those who are watching a couple of videos there in general will get turned away pretty quickly if your content isn’t exceptional. This leads to short watch times on your promoted video.\n\nIf you don’t know about the importance of watch time and audience retention: It’s basically YouTube’s way of ranking videos. If there are two videos, both with similar tags and titles, one with 10k views and an audience retention rate (ARR, also called „average percentage viewed“) of 25% and one with 1k views and an ARR of 90%, YouTube is way more likely to show the second video on both search, related videos and a user’s home page (in the „watch it again“-section). This obviously leads to the 10k video staying at 10k views and the 1k video eventually taking over the first one in the long run.\n\nNow, back to self-promos: They destroy your ARR and thus make your video less visible across the site. You don’t want that happening, so don’t promote too many videos.\n\nHaving *one* video (e.g. a channel trailer) you use to promote yourself (both in communities or as an ad) isn’t bad though as you don’t need to care about that particular video showing up in search. The issue is if you’re trying to promote all of your videos.\n\n---\n\nOn a related note: If you’re not promoting a video, you can use the ARR to roughly tell how interesting your video is. As a rule of thumb:\n\n* 0-10%: Misleading, gras growing in slow motion, hard to watch, 10h-stuff, live stream recordings\n* 10-35%: short-form content: really boring, long-form content: only for hardcore fans\n* 35-50%: short: below average, long: good\n* 50-65%: short: average, long: exceptional\n* 65-80%: short: good, long: awesome, how did you do this?\n* 80-100%: almost unheard of.\n\n*the border between short-form and long-form is at around 8 minutes*\nShaneH7646: Self promotion can be good depending on where you share it and who you share it to \n\nWhich of the following best characterizes the discourse type of the previous statement?\nA: Question\nB: Answer\nC: Agreement\nD: Disagreement\nE: Appreciation\nF: Elaboration\nG: Humor\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

After killing my bestie, I went there in my \"PVP\" gear and lost it all to multiple moving headshots.  Full Kevlar with 5 slot M4 vs guy in Leather with a pistol.  He was unstoppable. Nobody on the server was talented enough to kill him. Mods checked him out, not hacking. Just good.\n\nUnfortunately (for me) the end game currently has sort of a competitive FPS feel to it.  I personally DO NOT want this game to have that kind of feel. I like the craft-able \"Rust\" weapons.  I like the slow and steady crouching in the bushes.  I like organized, slow, careful attacks.  Not jumping up and no aim headshots.  It doesn't feel like what this game is supposed to be.\n\nThere are enough CODs in the world. Rust doesn't need to be another one.\n\nAlso, these always seem to be the same type of players that yell racist bullshit at you while they engage.\n\n\nEDIT: Good arguments, I guess I have to accept the fact that this game leans heavily on the FPS aspect and if I want to compete, I have to get better at the gunplay.\n\n\nmoses_the_red: What I love the most about this sort of thing is that a lot of people have a similar incident to what  you're describing here, and they call for a nerf to modern weaponry. \n\nBows require MORE skill.

All you have to do to volunteer, is [send us a message](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdetroitlions) letting us know you're interested in the next week.\n\n---\n\n###Team Overview\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings have been part of the NFL since their inaugural season in 1961, when they became the NFL's fourteenth franchise. The Vikings, like the Lions, are one of 13 teams never to have won a Super Bowl - they're 0-4 when competing for the Lombardi. However, they haven't been without success, boasting 18 division championships (including 6 straight from 1973-1978) and 27 playoff appearances (good for 3rd in the NFL).\n\nThis season, the Vikings are still trying to figure out who they are as a team. Things got off to a rocky start when the organization was swept up in controversy surrounding allegations of child abuse against perennial star RB Adrian Peterson. Since then, they've started three quarterbacks in three games. After injuries to Matt Cassel and 2014 first rounder Teddy Bridgewater, Vikings fans had PTSD-induced flashbacks to 2013 when Christian Ponder was dismantled in a Thursday night loss to the Green Bay Packers a week ago. Fortunately for the Vikings, Teddy says he's back to 100%, and will start this Sunday in their second divisional contest of the season against our Lions. Without AD, it will fall on Bridgewater to shape the identity of the Minnesota offense moving forward.\n\n---\n###[Depth Chart](http://www.vikings.com/team/depth-chart.html)\n\n**Offense**\n\n|  POS | FIRST             | SECOND            | THIRD             | OTHER                                       |\n| ---- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |\n| WR   | Greg Jennings  | Jarius Wright   | Charles Johnson | \n| LT   | Matt Kalil\n| LG   | Charlie Johnson | David Yankey\n| C    | John Sullivan |\t Joe Berger\n| RG   | Vladimir Ducasse|\tAustin Wentworth\t\n| RT   |Phil Loadholt|\tMike Harris\n| TE   | Kyle Rudolph (O) | Rhett Ellison | MarQueis Gray | Chase Ford\n| WR   | Cordarrelle Patterson (Q)| Adam Thielen\t|Saalim Hakim\t|Walter Powell\n| QB  | Teddy Bridgewater (P)| Christian Ponder\t\n| FB   | Jerome Felton | Zach Line\n| RB   | Matt Asiata (P) | Jerick McKinnon (P) | Joe Banyard\n\n**Defense**\n\n|  POS | FIRST             | SECOND            | THIRD             | \n|--|--|--|--|--|\nLDE\t|Brian Robison\t|Corey Wootton\t\nDT\t|Sharrif Floyd\t|Tom Johnson\nNT\t|Linval Joseph\t|Shamar Stephen\t\t\nRDE  |Everson Griffen |Scott Crichton\nSLB\t|Anthony Barr\t|Gerald Hodges\nMLB\t|Jasper Brinkley\t|Audie Cole\nWLB\t|Chad Greenway\t (D)|Brandon Watts |Michael Mauti\nLCB\t|Captain Munnerlyn |Josh Robinson |Marcus Sherels\t\t\nSS\t|Robert Blanton\t|Antone Exum Jr.\nFS\t|Harrison Smith (Q)| Andrew Sendejo\t\nRCB\t|Xavier Rhodes |Jabari Price |Shaun Prater\n\n###Notable Injuries\n\n* Starting receiver **Cordarrelle Patterson** is *questionable* for Sunday with a hip injury, but should play.\n\n* Starting tight end **Kyle Rudolph** has been *out* with a groin injury since Week 3, and isn't expected to return anytime soon.\n\n* Starting Will linebacker **Chad Greenway** is *doubtful* with a broken hand and rib.\n\n* Starting free safety **Harrison Smith** is *questionable* with an ankle injury.\n\n---\n###Strengths\n\n* The #1 WR in the Vikings offense, **Cordarrelle Patterson**, is an extremely quick target who is poised for a breakout season. He's been lacking targets so far, but the Vikes are eager to get him more involved. Plus, who can resist [that infectious smile](http://imgur.com/a/hgrh5)?\n\n* **Harrison Smith** has been rock-solid at safety this year. His +5.4 PFF grade is second only to Eric Weddle and Earl Thomas III. He already has 3 picks this season, one of which was an [81 yard return for a TD](http://www.vikings.com/media-vault/videos/Harrison-Smiths-80-Yard-Pick-Six-vs-Rams/9b615dd5-6528-45d8-b35a-3f8bddf4d958). He should play on Sunday despite the ankle injury.\n\n* The **dynamic RB duo** of Matt Asiata and Jerick McKinnon is a dangerous pair. Rookie QB convert McKinnon is a quick threat in the backfield, while Asiata can pound out the short yardage between the tackles. Together they have combined to put Minnesota's ground attack at 10th best in the NFL.\n\n###Weaknesses\n\n* The Vikings' **offensive line** has been very disappointing this year. 2012 Pro Bowl selection Matt Kalil has had a slow start, and PFF ranks the unit as the fourth-worst in the league so far. They're in for a tough matchup against the Lions' elite front seven - especially considering that Bridgewater failed to complete a single pass when under pressure against the Falcons.\n\n* The starting **defensive line** in Minnesota has racked up a collective -8.3 rating from PFF through the first five weeks of the year. Linval Joseph seems to be the weak link, with a -5.8 overall rating and an abysmal -6.8 rating against the run. This bodes well for the Lions' offensive line, which is looking to bounce back with LaAdrian Waddle returning for his second game since his injury.\n\n---\n###Players to Watch:\n\n**Teddy Bridgewater - Quarterback**\n\nThe Vikings have high hopes for their rookie quarterback. We got a preview of his ability in Week 4 against the Falcons, where he went 20-31 passing and put up a 98.7 passer rating. However, he failed to complete a single pass on the rare occasion that he was pressured by the Falcons' defense. He should expect to see significantly more pressure from the Lions' defense, so he'll have to improve in that regard if he wants to lead his team to a win.\n\n**Jerick McKinnon - Runningback**\n\nSince converting from QB to RB in his senior season at Georgia Southern, McKinnon has proven himself to be exceptionally athletic, with a 4.41 40 yard dash time at the combine. He’s deceptively strong too, with a RB-best 32 reps in the bench press. He’s brought the dynamism to the dynamic duo in Minnesota’s backfield, and has been getting more and more looks each week. His success will be essential to the Vikings’ rushing attack.\n\n**Anthony Barr - Sam Linebacker**\n\nThe rookie from UCLA has not only stepped in as a day one starter, he’s been one of the better parts of the LB core in Minnesota. With 28 combined tackles, two sacks, and one pass deflection to his name, he should be a difference-maker in the run game on Sunday. While he has a 1.9 rushing defense and 1.1 pass rushing grade from PFF, he’s been weak in coverage with a -2.0 grade in that category this year. Look for the Lions to get the TEs involved on offense.\n\n\n---\n###Match-Ups to Watch:\n\n**Lions’ Defensive Line vs. Vikings’ Offensive Line**\n\nThe Vikings’s struggling O-line will be facing one of the best D-lines in the league this week. The Lions have to get penetration on passing plays in order to contain Bridgewater. The run blocking from the Vikings will have to be better than it has been this season in order to spark the offense and open up the passing game for Teddy. Look for the Lions to dominate the line of scrimmage on defense this Sunday. If Bridewater is pressured heavily and manages to succeed anyway, he’ll be hailed as nothing short of the second coming of Fran Tarkenton in Minnesota.\n\n**Vikings’ Linebackers vs. Lions’ Tight Ends**\n\nWith two of Detroit’s best receiving threats in Bush and Johnson likely not suiting up on Sunday, Lions’ offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi will look to get rookie TE Eric Ebron involved in the offense this week. Ebron has 8 catches for 80 yards and a TD this season, while Vikings’ LBs have given up the 14th fewest fantasy points against TEs. If they can keep the Lions’ TEs contained, it will take away a key part of [Lombardi’s Gulf Coast scheme](http://www.reddit.com/r/detroitlions/comments/2it7er/can_someone_explain_the_lombardi_offensive_scheme/cl5ddp6).\n\n**Lions’ Offensive Line vs. Vikings’ Defensive Line**\n\nThe strength of the Vikings’ front seven is their rushing defense - the defense has scored a collective 3.2 PFF rating against the run this year. Meanwhile, the Lions’ offensive line has put up an abysmal -9.9 rating in run blocking. This very well may be the deciding matchup of the game. The Lions’ rushing attack will have to improve if they hope to develop any kind of a rhythm on offense, and that starts with good blocking up front. Hopefully, LaAdrian Waddle will develop some consistency in his second game back at RT. If the Vikes manage to stuff the run and create pressure on passing downs, Stafford will be in for a long day.\n\n---\n\nSince everybody's clamoring, I'll make a final score prediction: Lions 20, Vikings 10\n\n---\n\nVikings fans!

    "291": "cheeseislifee: [Read Part 1 Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/neckbeardstories/comments/4kf5du/tiny_fascist_part_1_shyness_vs_selfrighteousness/)\n\n-------\n\nThe Cast: \n\nYounger version of Me (A.K.A. Casey) - A junior in a small suburban high school. Hella shy at the time. If you asked my classmates to describe me, they’d probably say “Who? Oh, that kid with her nose always buried in a book.”\n\nMr. Grant - My American Law teacher. A pretty laid back young guy, who managed to make a kind of dry subject interesting. He loved getting the class involved in discussions and debates, and even managed to get my opinionated side to shine at times. \n\nEmily - A freshman who I called “Tiny Fascist” for reasons that will soon become clear. The legbeard of this story. She came to school looking like she’d just rolled out of bed, complete with pajama pants, baggy anime and MLP tees, and tangled greasy hair. She was extremely small and skinny, to the point that she looked like she looked like she should be starting middle school instead of high school. \n\nThe Rest of The Law Class - About half sophomores and half seniors. Mainly slackers, athletes, and stoners who were looking to take an easy elective. Pretty cool people, but since they were already friends and I was terribly introverted, we didn’t talk much. \n\n------------\n\nI promised a debate in my last post. But first a recap.\n\nIn my high school law class, I had the misfortune of sharing a desk with an extremely self righteous girl named Emily who had some interesting opinions about how our legal system should be run. “Innocent until proven guilty” and many other rights we have were bullshit in her eyes. \n\nOn to the story!\n\nAbout halfway through the year, Mr. Grant announced our midterm project. We would be holding debates on hot topics in politics. Gun control, education, immigration, alcohol/drug laws, the death penalty, or anything else we could think of. We would work in teams of two, debating against another team of two who would cover the other side of the issue.\n\nTo choose topics, we would each find a partner. Each pair would get a random number, and the lowest numbered half of the teams would get to choose their own points to argue. The higher numbered teams would get to select which existing topic they would like to oppose. \n\nNow, I love a good debate. In my english and writing classes, where argumentative essays were a big part of the curriculum, I would challenge myself by picking a viewpoint that would be interesting to consider and hard to defend, just to make writing the essay a bit more fun. While a couple of my teachers noticed I had rather inconsistent opinions, I was always graded highly. Even though I was shy socially, when I had a topic to discuss and research behind me, I could go on and on. \n\nSo, when Mr. Grant gave the class a minute to partner up, everybody chose the person they were sharing a desk with. I, of course, got stuck working with Emily. I knew I wasn’t about to get her to do a reasonable topic, so I just hoped we’d get a high number so we wouldn’t be allowed to pick our own topic.\n\nNo luck, our number was 2. After the first group decided to argue that the drinking age should be lowered to 18, Mr. Grant turned to us to choose a topic. \n\n“The death penalty!” Emily exclaimed without consulting me.\n\n“Is that what you want to debate, Casey?” Mr. Grant asked me, noticing how this was the first I was hearing about it.\n\n“Sure,” I said, relieved it wasn’t something stranger.\n\n“Wait, the death penalty is already legal… Let’s argue that criminals under 18 can receive the death penalty too.”\n\nWell, fuck. There’s the bloodlust I know you for, Emily.\n  \nWe quickly received an opposing team, two of the smartest guys in the class who probably thought we’d be easy to beat. \n\nFuuuuuuuck. \n\n-------------\n\nThe next week was dedicated to research, and I was kicking myself for not speaking up against the topic Emily had chosen for us. How the hell was I supposed to win this debate?\n\nEmily, though, was in her element. We got to go to the computer lab during our research week, and for the sake of my own sanity, I suggested spending several days researching independently before coming together on Friday to compare our notes. During that time, I heard her giggling to herself and scribbling like a madwoman in her Lisa Frank spiral notebook.\n\nOur opponents, sitting not far from us were reading out some damn good quotes like \"From a moral standpoint, it would be misguided to equate the failings of a minor with those of an adult, for a greater possibility exists that a minor's character deficiencies will be reformed.” \n\nI was starting to stress about failing the midterm project. But then, as I recalled a project I did a week ago, a bolt of genius hit me. \n\n------------\n\nFor that previous project, which was really just a bit of a time waster on a half day, we had been instructed to draw humorous comics depicting felonies. It was a kind of silly project, but I gave it my all with a four panel comic. It went as follows:\n\nPanel 1: Spongebob cheerfully sitting by a fire. “Hey kids! Let’s sing the campfire song!”\n\nPanel 2: Spongebob singing “ C A M P F I R E   S O N G song. C A M P F I R E   S O N G song. And if you don't think that we can sing it faster than you're wrong, But it'll help if you just sing along!”\n\nPanel 3: A zoomed out view reveals Spongebob singing outside of a burning building, as police cars swerve into the frame.\n\nPanel 4: Spongebob being delivered a Guilty of Arson verdict in court. \n\nWhen I’d finished, I walked up to the front of the room and set my comic on Mr. Grant’s desk. He took one look at it and spit out his coffee laughing. \n\nMost of the other comics were based around puns. (Man killed on ice rink / Cop says “We have a smooth criminal here”) \n\n---------------\n\nSo back to my genius idea for the debate project. If you’re thinking I would burn Emily’s house down while wearing square pants and singing a silly song, you have sadly come to the wrong conclusion. I’d instead use the glorious powers of satire and humor in the debate.\n\nI knew I was a bit of a teacher’s pet in that class since I actually answered questions, and paid attention instead of trying to talk through class. That combined with the fact that Mr. Grant apparently thought I was pretty funny gave me a little confidence I could pull my plan off. And if I couldn’t, my grades in the class were good enough so one failure wouldn’t make me fail the course. \n\nI decided to channel my best Stephen Colbert impression, and go all out with my argument. To an absurd degree, perhaps. I’ve always loved how Colbert could give a pretty hilarious yet still informative report on something, selling you one side of an issue by making a caricature of the other side. \n\nSo, that was what I would do too; draw attention to the flaws and absurdities behind our very own side of the argument, while sticking close enough to a believable perspective that I could look like I was trying to play it straight. Yes, it was self-sabotaging and more than a little vindictive to undermine our side of the debate, but at least it would be hilarious. \n\nI started drafting lines on topics that were likely to come up during the debate. Unfortunately, my notes have been lost, though I remember one line went like this:\n\n“When you have someone who is too young to fully understand the consequences of their actions…” (Give the class a meaningful look, for dramatic effect) “You must teach them.” \n\n-----------\n\nBy the end of the week, when we had decided to share our research with each other, Emily only cared about telling me her own ideas. And when I say ideas, I mainly mean indignant ranting that didn’t have much research behind it at all. \n\nI asked that she agree to take turns turing the debate, neither of us speaking twice in a row. She agreed.\n\nWe would be debating on Monday, along with half of the class, and the other half would have their debates on Tuesday.\n\n----------\n\nThe weekend before the great debate, I started getting nervous. Maybe I shouldn’t make a joke out of it… Even though I’m likely to lose with Emily on my team and two really smart, prepared, and charismatic guys as our opposition, I should still try. \n\nI managed to keep my resolve.\n\nMy parents asked over dinner how the debate was going. They knew about some of Emily’s earlier exploits, and being a bit overprotective (But well intentioned, of course!) they were worried about my grade. I did not mention my plans for the debate. Before my dad could ask to take a look at my work, my mom started talking about how bad her cold was getting, and how she felt too nauseous to finish her dinner. \n\nI went upstairs with her to bring her some Tums and chamomile tea, and the topic of the debate was dropped.\n\n---------\n\nOn the big day, Monday, I woke up. Several minutes later, I threw up. I had come down with my mom’s cold. \n\nThe debate that afternoon was forgotten, as I groaned for my dad to call me in sick before he left for work. I heaved again and then crawled back into bed for the day.\n\n------------\n\nTuesday, I still felt like shit, but I dragged myself to school since my high school had a very unforgiving absence policy. \n\nRemembering the debate, I figured that Mr. Grant would have swapped our timeslot with another team’s due to my absence, especially because of how much of the grade the project was worth. He’d even told all the groups to be ready to debate on Monday, in case of schedule changes. \n\nI got to class early, and for once Emily got there before the bell also. \n\n“Is our debate switched to today?” I ask her.\n\n“Oh no, I did the debate myself.”\n\n“Wait, you didn’t get the chance to reschedule?” I ask in surprise. Our teacher had always gone out of his way to be fair and reasonable, and he’d even mentioned the possibility of changes to the order of debates, if necessary.\n\n“I did. But I said I’d do it myself.” Emily said confidently.\n\n“Didn’t you think I’d want a chance to contribute? You remember I even said we should take turns so we both get to share what we worked on!” I say. \n\nShe said nothing. Perhaps she was surprised; I was not exactly the confrontational type.\n\n“Well, how did it go?”\n\n“Ok.”\n\n“Did you win?”\n\n“…Well… No.” \n\n“Did we get a grade?”\n\n“Not yet.”\n\nMr. Grant came in soon after, and got the next debate started quickly. I didn’t get another chance to talk to Emily for the rest of class. \n\nAfter class, I decided to talk to Mr. Grant about the debate I had missed. I waited until Emily had left the room, and went over to say “I heard that Emily presented our debate while I was sick yesterday, is there any reason our debate couldn’t have been switched to today?”\n\n“I gave Emily the option, but she insisted she could present it alone.”\n\n“You see, I’m asking because I’d hoped I could have contributed to the debate… To be honest, I’m worried about my grade right now.”\n\n“You did miss class when you knew your group was scheduled to present, and I’m sorry but I can’t force everyone else to wait for you.” \n\n“Could you at least tell me what the grade is, or an estimate if you don’t have it?”\n\n“I’ve already graded everything from Monday, let me find the page…”\n\nAfter a tense minute or two, he handed me a completed grading rubric. \n\nResearch: 2/10\nOrganization/Clarity: 3/10\nUse of facts: 0/10\n…\n\nOn it went. I skimmed to the end of the page to see the final grade. \n\n29/100.\n\nA FUCKING 29. \n\nOUT OF 100. \n\nEven with my plan of sarcasm-ing through my argument, I knew I could have gotten that score higher. My notes, while a bit overblown and mocking, cited a good number of case studies. And I had brought a page full of statistics on juvenile offenders who committed capital crimes. Plus, who knows, Mr. Grant might have just been amused enough by the debate to give us a respectable grade.\n\nIt really is a shame I will never know. \n\nAnd even more disappointing that I didn’t get to see Emily’s rant. \n\nFortunately, I think Mr. Grant realized how I’d gotten screwed over on my midterm project and pitied me. after a bit of begging for extra credit, he allowed me to write an essay to get my grade up to a maximum of 50, for the 50 percent I may have contributed had I not missed class. \n\nLooking back on it all, perhaps it was karma. I try to fuck with the Great and All-Knowing Tiny Fascist, and I get fucked right back. \n\n-------\n\nTLDR - I get partnered with Tiny Fascist for a major class debate. She decides we will argue to reinstate the death penalty for juveniles. I am quite fed up with her, so I craft some overzealous and satirical arguments that will undermine our own side, and hopefully amuse our teacher in order to get a passing grade. I fall sick on the day of the debates, and Fascist chooses to go without me, earning us a 29. \n\nNext Time: Mandatory drug education does not go as expected.\n\npatrickbickle92: Looking back at High School, I realized I should of kicked and screamed when shit like this happened. Like if I were to give your younger self advice; tell the teacher you can't work with Emily or tell Emily to shut up and enjoy doing zero work. As for the 29/100? Man, I wouldn't let that go. I'd bitch to a guidance counselor, than principal, superintendent....all the way to the Board of Ed.  \n\nWhich of the following best characterizes the discourse type of the previous statement?\nA: Question\nB: Answer\nC: Agreement\nD: Disagreement\nE: Appreciation\nF: Elaboration\nG: Humor\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

    "297": "[deleted]: \n***************************************************\nI awoke in a sterile smelling hospital room, weakly opening my eyes. \"Oh! he is awake!\" came a voice. I looked over to see a slightly chubby brunette nurse connecting IV's into my arms. Another nurse with black hair and starling blue eyes appeared at my side. \"Honey, you were in a terrible car accident, we did everything we could but could not save anyone. You were the only survivor.\" and suddenly it hit me. I remember sitting in the back seat while a few buddys hung out up front. The last image was of bright hedlights piercing the night, and then a squel. No. No, Derik and Jens couldnt be dead. Gagging, I tried to open my bloody lips to talk. \"I'm sorry dear but you have to have the breathing tube in for awhile, you have serious internal injurys. It's a mirical that you survived at all.\" With that I lay back, defeated. My friends were all I had, living through foster homes most of my childhood. Eventually, the soothing rythem of my breathing machine, and a strong morphine drip put me to sleep. Truly, I wish I could have never woken up. it would have made life easier.\n\n The next couple of weeks were a blur, waking up from surgery after surgery and submerging back into sleep. I would often awake to the main doctor staring at me with the lights off, alone in my room. His glasses reflected the moonlight onto me. After staring at me,making sure I saw, he would slowly, deliberately, leave my room. Only several months later was I able to stay awake constantly. Life no longer seemed hazy. \"Ah, you've awoken for good.\" said the thick german accented doctor with glasses, whom from this point on I just deemed 'Glasses'. \"Can I leave yet?\" I squeked, speaking for the first time in ages. \"my boy, you must rest. Perhaps in a few weeks time we might try to move you. For now we will have you resrained to the bed so you do not risk tearing your stitches. Noticing for the first time, my arms and legs were bound tightly, like a sex slave, to the bed posts. \"Please doctor, I don't like this. I promise I won't move!\" Glasses gave me a look of a maniac. \"My you look tired. We should up your morphine so you can sleep again.\" he said putting a new bag into the IV drip. \"no, please, I dont want to go to sleep.\" I begged, before slipping back into  darkness. \n\nThe next time I opened my eyes, a confusing scene met me. Glasses and the brunette nurse surrounded my room mates bed. Funny, I didnt realize until now i had a roommate. Listening over the sound of machinery, I managed to make out some of the conversation, though I wish I never heard it. \"Sign the will...... sign the will Jeffrey... you want to give us the money.....\" I heard loud moaning, and the distinctive sound of stitches being ripped out. \"SIGN THE WILL AND ILL GIVE YOU PAIN MEDS.....\" Glasses whispered loudly. \"Noo.... noo.....\" Jeffrey sobbed, moaning.  It was all I could do to keep from screaming, as the sound of steady ripping and the drip of blood  filled the room. \"Just do it dear.\" said the Brunette nurse cheerfully. \"Give in.\" \n\nout of the corner of my eye I saw her smile at him. Slowly, he reached over and signed the paper. \"See. Thats all you needed to to.\" Glasses hissed. Jeffrey was trying to scream, making gurgled sounds as he pulled at his restraints. Glasses walked towards him, taking his time, holding a needle. \"Nurse, it appears we have an unruly patient. Help hold him down.\" he said sarcastically. Giggling, the nurse covered his mouth as Glasses injected him. Jeffrey stopped screaming. After exiting, those two bastards left me alone in the room that stank of death, but not before amping up my morphine. :Is he still asleep?\" Chubby asked. \"For now.\" Glasses grinned.\n\n I'm not proud of what I did next: keep silent. But it was life or death. Once- If, I left, I would tell  my story, let them know what had happened. On my way being rolled to a rehabilitation room five days later, a nurse forgot my paperwork and left me in the hallway, leaning outside Glasses office. I leaned my head against the paper thin walls and tried to listen again.\n\n \"These numbers are too high.......several deaths.....Missing patients....\" were key words that rang through the wall. Glasses was yelling. \"How dare you insult my work! I am a renowned doctor, get out, get out of here!\" he screamed. Slamming the door, a the man Glasses was talking to rushed out. Glasses followed him, but froze when he saw me. \"ah, it is young Blake here again, listening in.\" he grabbed hold of my bed and began wheeling in, his light reflecting off his glasses almost blinding me. \"I cant let you leave now.\" and I entered The Room.\n\nTO BE CONTINUED. \nStormKid: Doctor , IS SPY! \n\nWhich of the following best characterizes the discourse type of the previous statement?\nA: Question\nB: Answer\nC: Agreement\nD: Disagreement\nE: Appreciation\nF: Elaboration\nG: Humor\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

Luckily I had planned on taking in my 2 thundermaws and hoping to get at least what I'd paid for them originally at my new store since I've moved.  So I showed him the cards and he looks at me and says that he can only give me 30 dollars for the two of them.  Unfortunately because I needed to get home I had to take the offer.\n\nI had originally paid 42 dollars to purchase the two cards back when they were still around 20 a piece.  Now that they are 45 dollars on star city and at least 38 in other places, expecting to get the 40 dollars back was a pretty reasonable expectation.\n\nThe biggest thing I've taken from this is that I really appreciate my new store owner much more than I already did.  He gives everybody fair prices for the cards that he sells, and buys.

    "303": "tgdm: ##UPDATE!\n\n[I did it](http://i.imgur.com/y6S1uXc.png), so can you!\n\n***\n\nThere are many people asking how to go about this and many people struggling with it. And I get it. It is a rough deal right now. I'll offer two separate paths for you to explore your options with; Solo or Group. But, before we get into that, here is a checklist that you will most likely need to see success. This checklist will be the ideal, not necessarily the requirement.\n\n***\n\n##CHECKLIST\n\nKey:\n\n○ = Orokin Catalyst/Reactor required\n\n◘ = Optional Mod choice\n\n☼ = Strongly Recommended Option\n\nX = Adjust Mod Rank as you see fit\n\n###Archwing Loadout:\n\n* Odonata Rank 30 - [imgur](http://i.imgur.com/YOGOTRe.png)\n\n>Mod List: Argon Plating (Max), Energy Inversion (Max), Enhanced Durability (Max), Auxiliary Power (Max), ◘Superior Defenses (Upgrade x 2)\n\n*Superior Defenses is optional. If you are not using an Orokin Reactor be sure to NOT max rank it.*\n\n* ○Imperator Rank 30 - [imgur](http://i.imgur.com/T60drow.png)\n\n>Mod List: Electrified Barrel (Max), Venomous Clip (Max), Rubedo-Lined Barrel (Max), Modified Munitions (Max), ◘Combustion Rounds (Max), ◘Polar Magazine (X), ◘Dual Rounds (Max)\n\n*Make damn sure the elemental bonus you are getting is Corrosive. Place your mods as shown in the image and you will be fine. If you cannot afford an Orokin Catalyst, stick with Rubedo, Venomous, and Electrified.*\n\n* ○☼Onorix or ○Veritux Rank 30 - [imgur](http://i.imgur.com/CnxGGfL.png)\n\n>Mod List: Cutting Edge (Max), Galvanized Blade (Max), Poisonous Sting (Max), Extend (Max), Glacial Edge (Max), ◘Blazing Steel (Max), ◘Furor (Max), ◘Tempered Blade (Max)\n\n*I forma'd Veritux because I like giant space swords and had to level Corvas anyways. Not necessary. I haven't found a Blazing Steel yet either.*\n\n###Warframe Loadout:\n\n* ○☼Valkyr, ○Rhino (◘○Prime), ○Zephyr, or ○Frost (◘○Prime) Rank 30 - [imgur](http://i.imgur.com/koLSc8a.png)\n\n>Aura List: ☼Rejuvenation (Max), Energy Siphon (Max), or Steel Charge (Max)\n\n>Mod List: Redirection (X), Vigor (Max), Vitality (X), ◘Fast Deflection (Max), ◘Flow (Max), Fortitude (Max), Steel Fiber (X)\n\n*Rejuvenation is your best choice if you are running as Valkyr. While Energy Siphon is very useful, you are much better off with emergency Team Energy Restore consumables. Steel Charge is luxury if the other two auras are already covered in group play. The mods listed are known to 100% work with Archwings and if you have to give up one, give up Fast Deflection and/or Flow. Warframes are listed in order of preference. For more on Warframe stat comparison, check [here](http://warframe.wikia.com/wiki/Warframes_Comparison).*\n\n###Gear Loadout:\n\n* Medium Team Energy Restore\n\n* ☼Medium Team Heal Restore\n\n*These are absolutely necessary for solo play. For more information on Team Restores visit this [page](http://warframe.wikia.com/wiki/Team_Bonus_Consumables). Also: not sure why it's Heal not Health but whatever.*\n\n***\n\n##Strategy: General\n\nThis will be in a simple bullet list format. If there is any confusion or need to elaborate further let me know in the comments.\n\n* Enemy AI will work as thus: When they spawn, they will rush to a random capture point and attempt to begin capturing it. After attempting capture, they will then fly directly towards a player in somewhat single-file. If they encounter another player along these preset paths, they will alter their course and engage the player. Also, if their flight from the point they are capturing to the player is too long, they may reset and return to the point they are capturing.\n\n* Enemies can attack while fast-traveling. This means that you cannot simply sprint away to recover your shields. It also means that Temporal Dregs can catch up to you at any distance and remove your ability to sprint. Enemies also appear to have nearly perfect aim so sprinting away is twice as much not an option without cover.\n\n* Odonata's fourth ability, Repel, will damage and push back enemies, permanently disarming them and also disabling movement for a short time. The duration shown when using this ability is not a cooldown but rather an uptime indicator, meaning you can use it multiple times in succession. This will be your go-to ability.\n\n* Odonata's second ability, Disarray, can be used to confuse enemy missiles. This ability must be used preemptively rather than as a reactionary defense tool. Enemies that come into contact with a flare are briefly stunned. This is a decent way to handle an unfortunate volley of missiles.\n\n* Missiles can be shot down and destroyed, but the damage from Repel will not destroy them. Disarray does not consistently disrupt missiles already in flight.\n\n* Do not melee excessively because that can quickly result in you being bombarded by rockets. Melee when it is safe, use your rifle when you are unsure.\n\n* At the beginning of each round your primary focus should be capturing points. If there are simply too many enemies coming to your current location and you cannot capture as a result, give it up and fly to another. Try to prevent them from capturing it if you can, but don't waste too much time for it.\n\n* Do not worry about keeping 4 points at all times. Sometimes you have to give up a capture point in order to stay alive or clear out some enemies and that is fine. Panic when you only own 1 point. If you managed to get 3-4 points before having to engage in combat at the start, chances are you'll be over 50% completion by the time you lose another capture point.\n\n* You do not have to go to a point that is being captured right away. If the enemy flies to you, kill it. If the enemy is flying back to the point you should then worry about chasing it down. **But regardless you should never stand still for too long.**\n\n\n***\n\n##Strategy: Solo\n\nFirst: set the game mode to Solo so you can pause if need be and not have to worry about unwanted joiners.\n\nI mostly only did this using Rhino or Valkyr so your mileage may vary, but pick the frame you think you would benefit most from. Rhino has an abundance of shields which can be useful, Valkyr has an insane amount of armor which prevents *most* instant-deaths from rockets when you are not able to see/react to them. I would strongly recommend using the Rejuvenation aura for solo play because it is much harder to sit around and use a health restore to recover than it is to drop an energy restore and get 50/100/150 energy to spam Repel with.\n\nAt the beginning of each round you should, for the most part, be worry free and can just focus on capping 3-4 points. If on the off chance the first point you pick is the one the AI zergs to, be prepared to pop an early Energy Restore so that you can #4 (Repel) them away and complete the cap. At the end of each wave, take advantage of the bugged/stuck enemies by using the time to replenish your health and energy if you feel the need. Do not ever sit in one spot too long. If you stop being careful, that will be the exact moment when enemy rockets bombard you from behind and instantly kill you.\n\nMelee is your best option for AoE clears on enemies and is VERY useful against targets which have been repelled and can no longer fight back. Melee is also useful for killing off a single enemy at a time while traveling between points. Melee can 1-2 shot Dregs with the proper loadout. That being said, you will be using your ranged weapon for the vast majority of the mission. Sniping point captures off in the distance for instance, dealing with incoming enemies while kiting.\n\nAnd finally, the most important piece of advice I can offer, do not be afraid to fail a few times. It's one thing to read all of this and it is another to experience it. It might take you a while but you will eventually get used to how the AI works. If you die early on in the first round, forfeit and restart rather than wasting your revives. Consumables are cheap, revives are not. There are definitely many bugs and unfair/unfun mechanics in play right now, but it is still doable if you take advantage of consumables, revives (for emergencies), and sometimes even the bugs.\n\n***\n\n##Strategy: Group\n\n* 1 x Rejuvenation Aura, 1 x Steel Charge Aura, 1 x Energy Siphon Aura, + 1 Steel/Energy Aura\n\n* 4 x Valkyr strongly recommended\n\n* At the start of each mission/round, split up and capture all 4 points. After that, congregate on a single point together.\n\n* Pay attention to the minimap/radar. See 20 red dots? That is the point you guys need to defend. \n\n* When *you* use Repel, keep an eye on any capturing enemies. They will seemingly just teleport randomly for anyone else in your group so it will be up to you to prevent the capture from completing.\n\n* Spam Repel, kill enemies, collect energy orbs, spam Repel some more. Occasionally use Disarray when enemies are incoming.\n\nAside from those bullet points it is essentially the same as solo play. The main difference is that there should be a VERY strong emphasis on killing enemies rather than running point-to-point. I should also make note that communication and teamwork are very important here. If you are the only person at a capture point and there are 10+ enemies inbound, you need to make the judgement call to sit and defend / repel spam or fly away until reinforcements are available. You will get outnumbered if you go alone, you will probably die if you are alone, and if you're worried about looting mod drops that should only matter after the round is done and you are on clean-up duty.\n\n***\n\nI hope this helps you guys out. Elytron is not worth the headache, but if you insist on mashing your face against Uranus (^heheh^heh^hehehhe^hehehahehaheaha \\), hopefully this will help.\n\nIf you have any comments or questions please just throw them below and I'll get to them when I can.\nYurilica: 2 things.\n\n1.) High shields are relatively ineffective against most enemies on that map due to them doing Blast damage. This goes for most standard enemies and Hellions. It doesn't matter if you have 1100+ shields or 500, they'll still go down in an instant due to how Blast damage affects shields. Armor is simply king in that mission.\n\n2.) When it comes to reliability in that mission, Valkyr is king, without any kind of doubt. You might as well ignore all other warframes in that mission. \nFrost is too slow as a warframe, the base speed of warframes affects the speed of your Archwings. \nWhile he's \"tanky\", that doesn't mean much if he simply can't outmaneuver Hellion missiles and can't move fast enough to dodge most bullet fire. Valkyr, Rhino(either Prime or Vanguard Helmet or both) and Zephyr are fast enough, but of those three Valkyr is simply overall the most reliable in that mission. Zephyr has better maneuverability(but is the squishiest), Rhino Prime with Vanguard has higher top speed, but Valkyrs durability and decent overall speed just trumps them all.\n\nTL;DR\nIf you rely on shields for tankyness on Uranus, you're gonna have a bad time. #OneTrueValkyr \n\nWhich of the following best characterizes the discourse type of the previous statement?\nA: Question\nB: Answer\nC: Agreement\nD: Disagreement\nE: Appreciation\nF: Elaboration\nG: Humor\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "304": "Raveynfyre: No introduction, it's not long enough for it.\n\nFriday was a \"treat yourself to dessert\" thing at the deli in my building. There were two options for $1.89. Strawberry shortcake, or a slice of cheesecake with toppings (not being weighed, most other food like this requires a scale at the register).\n\nThe options were simple, you chose either to create a strawberry shortcake (created by you, with a slice of pound cake, sliced strawberries and toppings) or cheesecake slice, also with the same topping options (incl. strawberries).\n\nThere were two slices of cheesecake when I saw the station, and I said to myself (out loud), \"I'm going to get *that* piece.\" Out of the two slices left, once was about 10% larger than the other. \n\nEnter Hammymus Maximus. Roughly 5'10\" and 350-400 lbs. Thinning hair, extremely obese, and out of breath. He had one small container filled with ~~salad soup~~ a few pieces of lettuce drenched in ranch, with a large helping of something containing a massive amount of mayo (like a veggie or broccoli \"salad\" but our deli makes those with entirely too much mayo. Seriously, it drips......).\n\nJust after deciding that this slice of cheesecake is going to die in the arena of food (by my fork), I walked to the opposite end of the salad bar to grab a tray-container-thing ( [like this but smaller](http://www.supplycity.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/7/1/7125.jpg) ) to put my lunch in (yeah this was my lunch, sue me).\n\nHe then moves faster than I have ever seem an extremely obese man move to the same container stack I was walking towards. He gets there first and rushes back to the cheesecake and grabs the same piece I had been gunning for. Bastard.\n\nImportant note, they were generous with the topping selection for something so cheap. The options available were; sliced strawberries, chocolate syrup, caramel syrup, and Cool Whip.\n\nI'm now waiting for Hammymus to add his toppings since he is blocking the entire station while creating his dessert. He pours at least 1/8th of a cup of chocolate syrup AND caramel syrup onto his cheesecake. He grabs the tongs for the strawberries and adds 3-pieces of strawberry on top, and then goes for the Cool Whip.\n\nThe serving bowl that this was in was approximately the same size as the large container you can get at the grocery store. Hammymus grabs the serving spoon and somehow manages to put **half of the filled serving bowl of Cool Whip** onto his (now swimming) cheesecake slice. \n\nIn all seriousness, I'd say that the cheesecake slices were about 2/3 the size of a **typical slice** you'd get at a restaurant. He not only buried it in with way too much syrup, but now with the addition of the Cool Whip, the serving tray/plate thing, was literally overflowing with Cool Whip.\n\nHe then picks up his other tray containing his liquid-salad lunch (same tray type but larger), gave me a shit eating grin like a spoiled child, and walked away. He tried to smile at me in the same manner that a co-conspirator would.\n\nDefeated, I grabbed the last remaining slice and added some caramel (about a tablespoon, but I'm bad at guesstimating), strawberries and a small dollop of Cool Whip to my cheesecake.\nFaancy: I think the gods were smiling on you that you got a slice at all...and that he didn't spit on it or something equally disgusting!

Read everything you can about nutrition, how the body processes the food you eat and particularly about insulin levels. \n\nFar too many people in my opinion go in to a new eating life style without understanding the implications of changing the food they eat. IMO the food companies don't have your best interests at heart, they are there simply to make a profit, one of the big fads is low fat but they just replace the fat with sugar so in reality it makes little difference. \n\nYou can do it, but you need to find something which works for you, both in terms of what you like to eat and what makes the weight come off. Set realistic goals and be prepared for a very long slog. \n\nYou weigh about the same as when I started so I know what a massive task it is, but take small steps and you will get there in the end. \n\nWhich of the following best characterizes the discourse type of the previous statement?\nA: Question\nB: Answer\nC: Agreement\nD: Disagreement\nE: Appreciation\nF: Elaboration\nG: Humor\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

She took my meds in the back and whatever she did, when she came back, all three of my meds came out to $16. She saved me over $300! It's small, but it definitely made my day.

Here's a fun anecdote that sums up my dilemma.\n\nEarlier today I went and picked up the books that have been sitting in my file for the past two months. The last time I picked up comics, I probably bought around fifty. I told myself that I would not buy anymore until I was caught up with what I had, but obviously, as I just mentioned, I went and brought home my haul this afternoon.\n\nAfter going for comics, I stopped by my wife's work to drop her off some food. She asked what I was going to do when I got home. I told her I was going to take a small nap and then get caught up on some comics. She laughed at that notion and explained to me that I would actually be going home and sitting on Reddit all night. \n\nMy comics are in the plastic bag I brought them home in and I am sitting here typing this.\nIdyllicSilence: Willpower. Use it. There's only so much that you can do on reddit. If you can't bring yourself away normally, just close the browser when you take your next biological break (you know, pissing, or eating).

    "339": "_jho: I've been programming for almost two years now, and I'm taking a course on scripting languages (mostly javascript) that uses code academy to teach a lot of the subject matter. \n\nLet me just say right off the bat that code academy is super frustrating. The site uses some kind of string compare function to check whether or not you wrote the right code about half of the time. So that means you *have* to use their variable names. No way around it.\n\nNow the site has gotten really popular. And I think that's great. Promoting programming and making it more available to people for learning is awesome. But I think people should be careful to make sure that they do lots of other stuff to teach themselves in addition to a site like code academy.\n\nMy problem is that the nature of the site - an online class without a live instructor or tutor or mentor - makes it harder for them to do something more dynamic. Variable names aren't a big deal, but the fact that you can't come up with your own is reflective of the bigger problem, a site like code academy limits creativity and creative freedom in learning to program.\n\nI first started learning from books, and then by working through the [project euler](http://www.projecteuler.com) problems with the help of stack overflow and the rest of the internet. This allowed me a lot of freedom in how I solved problems. I would learn something new, and then see what was possible with it. I would have a problem to solve, and I would use what methods I could to make it work.\n\nSo - what I'm trying to put into words is this I think: Stuff like code academy is awesome! It gives a lot of people exposure to programming they otherwise wouldn't get. However, these people to make sure that that's not all they do because there is a lot more out there and a lot more ways to do things than just what you see. It takes a lot of the creativity, freedom, and personality out of programming. \n\nAnyways, that's my opinion.\n\n(edit: formatting)\nKubaKuba: It does frustrate me, but I also appreciate it to an extent. When i was first learning to program back in highschool I had a bad habit of using very unorganized variables.

    "344": "[deleted]: Hello there.\n\nThese days, Medusa seems to be overlooked quite a bit in both pub and competitive scenes. It has a decent farming and carry potential, but due to her lack of mobility and a lackluster burst damage, she is deemed unworthy to be played frequently. So I'm here today to give my humble two cents on how she might be played differently, and allow her to be seen more in games.\n\n1) Role:\nTraditionally, she is played as a hard carry, but the problem is that she contributes little to team fights until she grabs at least one high value items, such as Daedalus, Butterfly, Linkens, etc. So, instead of designating her into this role, I was thinking that she can take on more of a mid-game oriented role, such as Mirana, QW Invoker, Centaur, Tide etc. Medusa has a great CC ultimate (which goes through BKB, kills illusions instantly) and survivability - with right positions in team fights, she alone can split up the enemy team into two or more - so the gap to fill in order for her to be useful in the mid-game is her mobility.\n\n2) Items:\nTo complement this inadequacy, I would like to suggest Blink Dagger and Euls. Having a Dagger allows her to blink herself into the middle of a team fight and CC the entire enemy team effectively, and although I have not tested this yet, I think her ultimate is not canceled while she cyclones herself, like Exorcism. In addition, Euls boosts mana and mana regen, which contributes towards Medusa's survivability, and gives much needed 45 movement speed.\n\n3) Team composition:\nHer teammates should be comprised of heroes that can deal high burst damage, preferably physical ones to complement her ultimate. If her team is magic burst oriented, her ultimate must be used very carefully. I would suggest it be used as an initiation, finisher (after all spells are expended), or defensively when the team fight is lost. \n\nFor those of you who read this through, thanks for reading, and please leave any thoughts regarding this topic.\n[deleted]: With just Blink and Euls, she'll be way too squishy to initiate. I prefer stat-focused, late-game builds like Linken's->Manta->Butterfly. Morph, Naga, and Terrorblade all do those kinds of builds better, though. \n\nWhich of the following best characterizes the discourse type of the previous statement?\nA: Question\nB: Answer\nC: Agreement\nD: Disagreement\nE: Appreciation\nF: Elaboration\nG: Humor\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

I'm a Rock N' Roll musician, and I don't have much love for Wylde's playing style or sound. But, God damn it, I loved the sound and feel of that guitar. The neck was chunky, but comfortable.

    "348": "[deleted]: This is LONG, really long, and took a while to type.\n\nI will start this story with 24 year old me, I applied for a job in a local petrol station and got it, it was my first full time job since the economy fell on its backside.\n\nI used the job to get through night courses in plumbing and bricklaying, all a waste of time by the way since nobody would hire at a rate that could have paid rent for an apprentice, so i went on to learn how to drive with the extra leftover after bills, also a bit of a waste of time, since jobs were like gold dust.\n\nI settled down into the work after a while and got used to the workload, it consisted mostly of serving customers, stocking up and generally overseeing the smooth operation of the petrol station over the night, we had to watch out for drive off's etc etc.\n\nWhen the oil derrick exploded things at work started to deteriorate slowly, I was lucky because I had a 40 hour contract and I was the only full time worker on nights, my shifts were safe but the micromanaging started very slowly trickling in, new schemes started, online courses popped up (these were multiple choice questions, with a 100% correct rate needed to pass or you start over, with 40-50 questions, I shit you not, our assistant manager knew these answers off by heart thankfully)\n\nMy shift, me and my co worker started suffering on nights, area managers would come in during the day and randomly check on us through the cameras, questioning things we did, our break times, this was all up to us and we always got the work done and the shop ready but they didn't care, we would always be told we did something wrong or missed something, it got tiring.\n\nThis went on for a couple of months, then they got a new area manager in and he decided that the night shift had too many people working on it, the guys who worked with me were shifted onto another time period and I was left alone on the nights, to serve at the pay window, we had 12 pumps and a big shop, I had to constantly run around and get things for customers, which involved me walking around the side of a large till area to the front of the shop each time and also watching the forecourt.\n\nI found myself a bit stressed, the first reason is I could not take a break or sit down to eat, I ate where I worked, going out the back to break was not allowed and if I did people would be pounding on the window, yelling and beeping car horns, I also found that the same would occur if I needed the toilet, angry people would greet me at the window after peeing or defecating, they didn't care and were mostly rude, apparently it doesn't matter that I process food and water, they just want their petrol.\n\nThis went on for about 6 months, I had nobody to talk to at work, had no time to eat properly, frequently had stomach ache from getting up to get someone a pack of chewing gum in the middle of the night while I ate.\n\nSalvation came when the site was sold to [REDACTED], they reinstated the two people on night, they had more workers during the day to handle all the customers and the stock, nights became a bit easier to put up with but that didn't last sadly.\n\nThe company that brought into the shop area complained they were not making enough money, they cut the day staff and this put more pressure on the nights to do more work, we handled it between the two of us but then we were lumped with an absolute nightmare of a manager and our good manager kicked out.\n\nThis new manager was a bastard, he would come in at 1am and micromanage us for 5 hours or so, he got told off for this when we went to human resources and instead he would come in half hour before we ended shift and tell us we need to do a bunch of things before we left, we never stayed to do them even though he offered to pay overtime, which he wouldn't because the company would crucify him for it.\n\nThis guy was eventually ousted after he called up our old manager and started shouting at him (he would do this after getting drunk), the manager recorded this happening once and sent the recording to head office, that was the end of that idiot, he had given us hell for about 7-8 months and everyone was glad to see the back of him.\n\nThings were ok for a few months after that, if you compare it to having a drunken maniac shouting at you over the phone some nights and yelling at you in the morning, but then the company sold off the site to a private owner.\n\nThis owner was the worst person I have ever met, his first action was to cut the night shifts to one person, me again, alone on the nights, 5 nights a week, angry customers at the window whenever I went to the toilet, to make things worse all the stock changed and they got mad about the old stock not being there.\n\nThe tills were not compatible, at all, the card machines broke down, this was a problem because I only had one till to work with, try explaining to someone they have to go somewhere else, get cash out and come back while leaving the car on the forecourt, it usually ends with them pissing off and not coming back (pumps are activated at the till, if you have three people pumping and the card machine has an error when they put the card in you are fucked).\n\nThe new manager started doing shady things, he called a staff meeting one day and told us all that we are responsible for drive off's and he will take it out of our wages (he was the franchise owner and paid our wages), this resulted in a lot of arguing and people walking out, I stayed because I rarely had drive off's and I feared not being able to pay rent was worse than losing £40 here and there.\n\nI started having a mental breakdown, I would talk to myself at night because of the isolation and the stress eating, I started getting angry at the customers who got angry with me and the complaints started rolling in.\n\nWhen a business transfers ownership the contract for the current staff is protected for 6 months, after that it falls to the new owner what to do with the staff, they can simply decide not to renew it after that, this is exactly what was about to happen to me at the end of the 6 month period, my friend who worked across the road had the same manager, he always knew what was going on and his manager was my manager, both franchise sites for the same man, he told me one day that after my contract comes up it won't be renewed, I could count on his word because he was never wrong about these things and had never lied to me (to my knowledge)\n\nI had a months warning and I decided enough was enough, I arranged to move out, cancelled all my bills and services, let the landlord now I was moving in a month and arranged to move back with parents, I also arranged to move on the day I got paid, I decided to fuck him over by being on the road to another city instead of turning up for work, he also lived in another city and would have to come in when I didn't, suck on that, bitch.\n\nI feel a lot better now I am back with parents again, I can try and learn a trade now, might be doing it a bit late as I am 30 but better late than never, I have lost half a stone since moving and feel a lot healthier, the stress has gone and I am generally a lot happier, I have enough savings to support myself and my mother here for a long time,or until I find decent work.\n\nThere is no possible way I can TL:DR this, its long and its my shortened version of the last 6 years of my life and how it was awful.\n\n[deleted]: I'm happy to elaborate on any details as long as its not

I want your supervisor! \r\rSo I call the helpdesk, and  we have a rule that after waiting for 2 minutes, it disconnects you.

How could he mess that up?”\n“He said he measured it Punx.”\n“Measured it!? What the fuck!? Was he trying to build a deck!? It’s labeled in the supply room! You don’t measure cartridges!”\n\nThe supply room is meticulously labeled. This is a small office. 3 networked printers. 40 workstations in a cubicle format. Everyone knows what printer is what. There is no excuse.\n\nI inspect the damage. Cartridge is broken. Pieces shattered, torn off parts. Destroyed. Yup, wrong cartridge.\n\n I turn my attention to the printer and the halfway inserted cartridge.\n Yup, correct cartridge.\n\n I pull the cartridge out and view it for damage. None. Try to reinsert it. With a little wrangling and a bit of force it goes in. I reverse. Will not come out without the same wiggling and force.\n Put it back in and test printing.

    "412": "AnotherClosetAtheist: Edits: I offered a shit-tier grammar experience.\n\nI've posted this data before, but with recent news I'll post again.\n\nhttp://www.scouting.org/About/FactSheets/operating_orgs.aspx\n\nAbout 71% of all scout troops are religiously chartered.\n\nHalf of all religiously chartered troops are LDS.  \nBut... only one-quarter of religiously chartered scouts are LDS.\n\nRight off the bat you can estimate that LDS troops are half the size of others. And that's not a good thing. That is McScouting. Every ward has a chartered troop, regardless of how many boys there actually are. Wards are geographically centered around neighborhoods. This means that your next-door neighbors are your ward members, schoolmates, and Scout buddies. You never leave your bubble.\n\n-----\n\nLets' math.\n\nIf you take out the Mormons, there is an average of 31 scouts per religiously chartered troop.\n\nIf you only include Mormons, there are 11. One-fucking-third. And it's the same assholes you see the rest of the week.\n\nHere's the kicker: If you include Mormons and non-Mormons together, the average is 21 scouts per troop.\n\nTHE MORMON CHURCH HAS SUCH A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON SCOUTING THAT IT SINGLE-HANDEDLY REDUCES THE NUMBER OF BOYS PER TROOP BY ONE-THIRD.\n\nThe Episcopals have the biggest troops (35), followed by the Presbyterians (34), then Methodists (32), Reformed Church in America (whatever the fuck that is, 31.6)\n\nThe next worst comes in at 16, which is still nearly 50% higher than the Mormons.\n\n-----\n\nThe Mormon Church is a McScouting Eagle Mill. There are no troop leader elections - like a real troop would do - because they are appointed by prophecy of the bishop. The troops are too small to divide into real patrols. You just go with your church chums who are also your neighbors within 1/4 mile of you. You don't branch out and meet new people. Plus, scout announcements are made at church, and vice versa.\n\nMormon Scouting is horrible, and I hope they quit.\nHotKarl_Marx: Yeah.

    "432": "RideTheLine: Arlowe Acilius awoke in his quarters, having slept very little. His rest had been plagued by the usual nightmares, his students rebelling in the middle of a sermon, hooded figures breaking into his room at night, and his deceased wife rising from the grave. It had been a few years since Arlowe had gotten any proper sleep, not since he became the Professor of Metaphysics at the Arcane University. He tired of giving the same few lectures to different groups of equally faceless apprentices, and never feeling any sense of accomplishment. He was once able to occupy himself during the night with his studies, but the library had recently run out of fresh material for him. Without any chance to partake in the words of others, he was forced to write his own.  \n\nArlowe approached the podium, and took a moment to observe the congregation before him. A fair amount of apprentices had showed up, eager to learn, quills and ears at the ready. Arlowe sighed, and stroked his grizzly beard. How much longer would he have to suffer this dreary existence?  \n\n\"Today, apprentices, I would like to cover a topic we have hardly touched on. I wish to enlighten you on a subject of a darker tone than usual. Today I wish to discuss Sithis.\"  \n\nThe apprentices responded with mixed emotions. Some were eager to stray into something new, some were uncomfortable with the morbid idea, and others were dismissive. Sithis is just The Void, is he not, what could there be to learn about nothing?  \n\n\"As we all know, Sithis is synonymous with The Void. Sithis is no god, no, Sithis is one level past any tangible god. We all know of Anu and Padomay, yes? The first primordial forces that shaped existence. We have also learned of Aka and Lorkhan, who were born as time and space, realizations of Anu and Padomay. In between them lies another sub-gradient, the souls of the original two, Anui-El and Sithis. As per usual, these two serve as direct opposites, these being everything and nothing. Sithis is nothing itself, the infinite emptiness too absurd for our perceptions. Within Sithis is nothing, but we, as mere mortals, cannot comprehend true nothing. We are too far removed from Sithis to understand, I believe the Ada can understand it, but not us. Try and imagine nothing. What do you see? An infinite blackness, I assume. But that is not nothing, it is still an image of blackness. You cannot imagine nothing, our minds are too simple. Sithis, as we've said, cannot be directly perceived, but the result of it can. Some claim that Sithis was the first, which is a believable idea, for what can come before everything but nothing? And the only thing that can come before nothing is nothing. Nothing gave way for everything, where stasis and change could fuel time and space, and all of the Aurbis could function. In the Dawn, we know there was no time, so Sithis came from Padomay, but also emerged at the same time. Perhaps Sithis really is the start of the house. However, what that damned league of assassins is wrong about is the nature of their 'Dread Father.'\"  \n\nA rather rebellious youth, Antoine Marienne, interrupted. \"And just what do you mean by that? Sithis is a god like any other.\"  \n\n\"And that is where you too are wrong. Sithis is a force, Lorkhan is the first being with identity. Remember that the precious 'Night Mother' is widely regarded as an aspect of Mephala. The way I see it, the assassins are just being manipulated by the Webspinner, and the Daedroth needed a being to scapegoat, one that does not have a voice of its own. The Sithis of the Dark Brotherhood is hardly the Sithis of the Aurbis, it is merely a fabrication. Sithis is a void in which nothing can ever be, and nothing will ever be, not the shepard for some band of heathens. But, enough about nothing, open your books to chapter 12, section 35: On the Nature of Trans-Kalpic Transportation...\"  \n\nArlowe sat at his desk and wrote and wrote. If he had nothing left to read, he would leave others with new material. He had become fixated on Sithis. How can nothing be? Wouldn't the fact that the nothing is there mean that it is something? Sithis is an identity, and an identity is something. How do we even know this nothing exists?  \n\nThere was a knock at the door.  \n\nAnd it was the last sound he ever heard.\nheyfatkid: why do Sotha Sil and Sithis have such similar names?

Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**\n\n* I'm a casual gamer who is starting university this fall, so this is going to be a sort of multi-purpose PC. Some games I'll definitely be playing are Fallout 4, Elder Scrolls Online and Grand Theft Auto V, but I'll also be playing many first person and third person shooters. I'll also be using this build to get me through school so you can expect me to run Microsoft Word and Excell on this machine. As a soon to be college STEM major, my life will revolve around this computer =)\n\n>**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** \n\n* $2000 but a couple hundred less than that would be prime so I could have some flexibility.\n\n>**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** \n\n* I plan on buying my parts in two weeks or less.

(Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** \n\n* I'm starting from scratch so I'd need a CPU, motherboard, CPU fan, video card, optical drive, mouse, monitor, power supply, RAM/storage, etc. (pretty much everything on pcpartpicker).\n\n>**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** \n\n* USA; I do have access to a Microcenter location.

Brands and models are appreciated.** \n\n* I don't plan on reusing parts from any computer.\n\n>**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** \n\n* Not interested in overclocking. \n\n>**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**\n\n* I love the idea of having an SSD for my operating system and also having an HDD to store all my downloads and games on. Also, I would like my computer case to be white and my computer fans to have red LED's to make for a white and red theme. \n\n>**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**\n\n* Again, a white and red color theme is the ultimate goal; other than that, anything is fair game. \n\n>**Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget?

    "444": "PeterGot: We all know that Shepard is unique somehow. It is stated throughout the third game by many (including the Leviathan and the Starchild). Because of that he is able to finally break the cycle provided he doesn't refuse, of course.\n\nBut why is Shepard able to stop the Reapers once and for all? One theory, putting all the pieces together, is the following:\n\nIt is stated by the Prothean VI Vendetta that time is cyclical... not just because of the Reapers. Some things necessarily happen, like a group that wants to control the Reapers rather than destroy them. Before our cycle, the Reapers came through the Citadel to the world and killed many before they could react. \n\nNow let's assume that there has been a Shepard equivalent in all cycles before, like there has been a Cerberus equivalent. All these previous Shepards got killed fighting the Reapers early and because the whole galaxy was under attack, nobody could do anything about it. The previous Shepards stayed dead and did not succeed in breaking the cycle.\n\nThen the Protheans came and because of Ilos, they were able to delay the Reapers in our cycle. \"Our\" Shepard got killed as well (ME2 Prologue), but because the Reapers were not here, people had time to react. As we all know, this resulted in Shepard being rebuilt by Miranda and Cerberus in the Lazarus Project. That means, that even though our Shepard died as all the previous did, he was resurrected and therefore able to finally break the cycle.\n\n**TL;DR: The Protheans delayed the return of the Reapers. The Shepard of our cycle thus didn't stay dead and was able to break the cycle.**\n\nWhat do you think?

However, we will begin offering free shipping on orders for two or more bottles.\n\nAs a community of vapers that has really helped to get the word out regarding our product I felt that you all deserved an explanation for why we have decided to start charging more. There are two primary reasons. When this company started out I was the only employee and for the last six months it has just been my brother and I filling every order that has come in. We have grown to the point where we need to begin bringing on additional help, which surprisingly enough does not come for free. The second primary reason that we are raising the prices is to help us get out ahead of the looming FDA regulations.\n\nI know that there will be many of you who are frustrated with our company and our brand for raising the prices. Believe me this was not an easy decision to make. I've been mulling over this for about three months.\n\nOur prices have always been more than reasonable, and we believe that even by raising our prices we still fall within the range of reasonable. I personally believe that the quality of juice that you receive along with our customer service is worth what we'll soon be charging. However, what I think and what is reality are often two different things.\n\nThank you all for helping my company grow and for the passionate following the we've received.

I asked her which references in particular and for some details(its pretty informal) but she didn't want to tell me. I'm glad I got the job, but this concerns me and I wonder how to weed out these bad references while still keeping my resume in tact.\n\nI have listed on my resume one job in particular where I left without giving notice. The work environment was toxic, and I had always assumed that I would be able to clarify if asked directly.

Is there another way to handle it?\n\nAlso, I don't know about any other of my sources that were critical of me. I know for some of the ones that would have only nice things to say about me, but is there a good way to figure this out? Should I call my sources and pretend to be an employer asking about myself? I was always under the impression that my resume was a pretty strong one.\n\nEdit: I'd like to know not only who is saying what about me, but also what was said. I think after I've had this job for a bit, and they feel like I'm a good fit, I will bring it up again, as I am pretty sure former employers aren't supposed to go in-depth about you. I only had two references listed, so I am not altogether sure if one of them just said something that came off wrong while trying to appear to give a balanced opinion of me or what.\n\nThis bothers me for the normal reasons of course, but it also bothers me because I am going into a new job with the impression that I am already on thin ice.\narfobeat: Did you confirm with your references prior? It sounds really strange for someone to agree to be a reference then kick dirt on you. Also, I'm not sure you're really allowed to be critical of former employees.

    "457": "Nheat: I run a Lightning Tendrils build and I recently specced into Vaal Pact so I wouldn't instantly kill myself to reflect packs (and ideally, be somewhat able to run reflect maps as well). But what I didn't consider is that I use Cloak of Defiance, so while my health is constantly topped off, my mana shoots down to 0 and stays there. If I turn off Arctic Armour I can sorta regen fast enough to at least cast my spell so long as I'm not constantly attacking huge packs, but it adds slight concern that I effectively have no MoM during this. I have a HoT/CoH/Warlord's Mark setup, but it doesn't seem to be enough mana leech (or maybe it just feels not reliable enough because it doesn't apply to all monsters instantly, and only applies to any after I've killed something).\n\nI came up with 3 possible solutions for it:\n\n1. [Berek's Grip](http://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Berek%27s_Grip) - A unique ring I plan on getting sooner or later (I use the Three Dragons+Pyre combo). I'm not entirely sure how much benefit another 5% mana leech will have though, since leech rate will remain the same\n\n2. [Battle Rouse](http://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Battle_Rouse) - Kinda like a pseudo-vaal pact for mana when it comes to reflect? I'm not sure if it's enough, I would have to try it out. My main issue with it though is that I'm not really sure it's worth 3 skill points to get in my opinion\n\n3. [Lavianga's Spirit](http://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Lavianga%27s_Spirit) - Sorta expensive and I don't know when I'd even use it outside of reflect maps, but it does seem like a very good solution. So long as I keep hurting myself, the flask should remain in effect for the entire duration. In theory, this would allow me to always be able to cast my spell, keep Arctic Armour on, and even let MoM more or less work still\n\n\nAll that said, I could just continue to not run reflect maps since Vaal Pact on its own is at least enough to deal with the occasional reflect packs. Just wanted to gather others' opinions on the topic. \nSchiferlED: If you are doing an AA+CoD build anyways you should have crazy high mana/regen. Why is your regen so low that you need leech in the first place? Are you just running a low level AA and have CoD on with a low mana pool?\n\nMaybe I'm underestimating how much damage you are getting from reflect. \n\nWhich of the following best characterizes the discourse type of the previous statement?\nA: Question\nB: Answer\nC: Agreement\nD: Disagreement\nE: Appreciation\nF: Elaboration\nG: Humor\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

    "463": "The_Draigg: Watching the recent playthrough of Terminator 3: The Redemption, a sudden realization hit me: The Terminator timeline is really hard to follow. When a franchise bases itself around time travel, you know it's going to be a bit tricky with the details. So, I've decided to write up a timeline guide from my Terminaor-loving brain, to help a few people who may be confused. **Also, spoilers for all movies and shows.** So, let's get started:\n\n**Original Timeline**: Judgement Day is on August 29, 1997. John Connor is fathered by Sarah Connor and some random jabroni who died before the war. John Conner himself leads the resistance to defeat Skynet in 2029. He sends Kyle Reese to protect Sarah from a Terminator Skynet sent back in time as a last-ditch effort to win the war.\n\n**Timeline A**: Kyle Reese and the Terminator arrive in L.A. on May 12, 1984. The future is changed here by Kyle becoming John's father instead of... (???). Also, although the Terminator is destroyed, it's remaining parts become part of the foundation of Skynet. Judgement Day still occurs on August 29, 1997.\n\n**Timeline B**: Another change happens with the arrival of another T-800 and a T-1000 in 1995. To make a great movie short, both Terminators are destroyed, and Cyberdyne, the creators of Skynet, is pretty much financially wrecked. Due to this change, the U.S. Airforce takes Cyberdyne's assets and keeps on working on developing Skynet. According to Terminator 3, Sarah Connor dies due to cancer in 1997, and John is killed by a T-800 model in 2032 (Unless you count the deleted scene timeline, where Skynet is never completed, and Judgement Day is averted. Sarah lives to old age, and John becomes a U.S. Senator).\n\n**Timeline C**: The T-800 model that killed John is reprogrammed and sent back in time by Kate Brewster, his future wife. This T-800 is sent to protect John and Kate from the T-X, who was sent back in time to kill them and John's lieutenants. Judgement Day is inevitable in this timeline, and it occurs on July 24, 2004.\n\n**Timeline D**: Although the events of Terminator 3 happened in this timeline, there were major changes that changed the war from the one John and Sarah knew, to one that is different. This is shown by the development of the T-800 series starting earlier than it did in the other timelines. The T-800 series is being developed in 2018, while in other timelines it occurred towards the end of the war. It's possible that the development of Marcus Wright as a prototype infiltration model had something to do with this.\n\n**Timeline B-2**: In this timeline, Sarah Connor doesn't die of cancer, and is still living with John in 1999. A T-888 is sent back to kill John, until he's saved by a Terminator named Cameron. Then the Connors and Cameron make a leap forward to 2007. Sarah would have normally died of cancer in 2005. Judgement Day's date is unknown exactly, but it occurs later than 2010, due to a separate Terminator arriving then to kill a governor.\n\n**Timeline B-3**: Kyle Reese's brother, Derek, travels back in time with some Resistance members around the time of Timeline B-2. They make a huge amount of changes, which somehow results in humanity struggling in the war, and Judgement Day occurred on April 21, 2011.\n\n**Timeline B-4**: Although several Terminators traveled further back in time, none of them made major noticeable changes to the timeline. However, a rogue(?) T-1001 takes the place of a CEO of a major company in 2005, to develop an A.I. to counter Skynet. Judgement Day's date is unknown in this timeline.\n\n**Timeline B-5**: This timeline is hinted to be made by some of Derek's actions in the past. This is easily the worst of the timelines, as two time travelers confirm that the Resistance is mainly dependent on reprogrammed Terminators, Skynet has human agents that regularly torture other humans, John Connor is less trusting of his lieutenants, and there is a third faction of rogue Terminators, loyal to neither Skynet or the Resistance. Judgement Day is hinted to be earlier than 2011 in this timeline.\n\n**Timeline E**: A T-800 is sent back in time to guard and train Sarah Connor from an early age. As such, multiple agents from other timelines come to this one, with the events of the first two movies happening in different ways. It's at this point that this point that the idea of a lengthy multiple timelines turns into a game of time volleyball.\n\n**Timeline ???**: Fit any other media here. From the games to the comic books, there's a pretty high chance that those events could happen, given the right changes. Given that this is a temporal war, timelines can change in all sorts of ways.\n\n**TL;DR**: The Terminator timeline(s) is/are more mangled than a dick shoved into a weed-whacker.\n\nI hope this helped out anyone who was confused, or acted as a refresher to any Terminator fans out there!\naromaticsubrxn: But the real question is when is judgement day? \n\nWhich of the following best characterizes the discourse type of the previous statement?\nA: Question\nB: Answer\nC: Agreement\nD: Disagreement\nE: Appreciation\nF: Elaboration\nG: Humor\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",
    "464": "zyberion: Needless to say, I'm humbled by your kind words. The least I can do is write a little more for those who want it! (Don't worry EDI ~~is coming~~ is here)\n**update**: Is it just me or is it Javik in here?\n\nOriginal Post: http://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/sfzcr/st_mass_effect/\n\nJeff continues to remember...\n\n**Jack** Jennifer Meer, \"Jackie\", \"Cool Pudding Lady\" these are all names that refer to a Shepard Institute cafeteria worker. Abrasive and rude as a convicted felon can get, Jack is \"volunteering\" at the Institute to avoid a trip to the big house. Despite her history, Jackie is often seen delivering food to Tabitha, Jeff, and other children on their treatment days. Jeff noted that each meal came with a cute doodle or a pretty origami crane. When Jeff confronted her about her preferential treatment, Jackie shrugged it off saying that she likes kids, since they're easier to talk to than adults and they understand what she wants. \"I just wanna be free, kid...more ways than one.\"\n\n**Jacob Taylor**: Jeff's physical therapist is John Tyler. A firm believer in the \"Anyone can better themselves\" mantra, John openly respects and even admires Jeff's optimistic attitude. He chose to be a physical trainer to help kids especially, admitting that he and his father are not on speaking terms. He pushes himself so he can be a better man than his father.\n\n**Samara**: Dr. Samantha Rogers is one of the three board doctors that oversee major decision-making at the Shepard Institute. A wise woman who, at times, is kind and motherly and at other times cold and distant. She's respected by the Institute's doctors for abstaining from any favoritism when it comes to breaking of protocol, but she's also feared as she's swift to deliver suspensions for even minor infractions of said medical protocols.\n\n**Kasumi Goto**: Mitsune Kiru is a spunky, silver-tongued intern. While she means well and admires what the Institute and its staff does, Mitsune tends to have a very \"laid-back\" work ethic and is often seen cat-napping in the strangest of places. She's almost never caught, much to her ill-conceived pride, and her innocent demeanor and persuasive excuses can even throw off Dr. Rogers at times. Jeff always feels the need to check his pockets, after he talks to her.\n\n**Zaeed Massani**: Zach Masters is a rough \"sunovabitch\"...or so he'd tell you. A member of an elite team of Australian soldiers sent to Vietnam during the war, he was the only one of his squad who survived a vicious ambush. He's often seen with Donald, trading war stories. Normally proud and boastful, the proud warrior grows melancholic whenever he mentions a Lt. \"Vido\". He's currently trying to get his old war rifle shipped from Australia.\n\n**Legion**: Larry Jenkins was a computer technician before he was admitted to the Shepard Institute to treat his malformed heart. Treatments have only been mildly effective and his doctors told him that he needed a transplant to live past a few more years. His rare blood type and dilated arteries make finding a donor heart extremely difficult, despite this, Larry has already passed up three matching hearts telling himself and his doctors that there are people who need it more urgently than him. Jeff befriends him when they meet in a quiet part of the Institute's gardens. Larry has been continuously trying to befriend Tabitha, but she's frightened by Larry's ghastly, gaunt appearance, convinced he's a ghost or a monster. He confides in Jeff his fear that there's no life after death and his actions in the world could be meaningless.\n\n**Edit**\n\n**Admiral Hackett**: Dr. Stephen Hackett is head of surgery at Shepard Institute and the second-most senior member of the board, behind Dr. Rogers. \"Hacksaw\" Hackett as he's referred to by his colleagues is a no-nonsense man who seeks to maintain the balance between research efforts and patient treatment. Although stone-faced, Hackett is infamous for his \"Hack it out.\" joke during his surgical consultations. Hackett takes a shining to Jeff after he talks to the boy about his future surgical options, and Jeff in return finds some comfort that his surgeon can still laugh at his job.\n\n**Ken & Gabby**: The inseparable nurse pair are almost always working on paperwork at nurse station three. Even Doctor Nagali acknowledges that they somehow work much more competently together. Ken regularly plays cards with the other nurses, and promises to teach Jeff how to play poker, when he's older. Unbeknownst to the pair, there is rumor that several doctors are betting whether they finally work out that \"unresolved sexual tension\" within the next year.\n\n**EDI**: Edith was a miracle born from tragedy. The sole survivor of a tragic aviation disaster, Edith was in a medically-induced coma for five months as doctor's worked to salvage what they could and remove what they couldn't. When she awoke, she was in the sterile white rooms of Shepard Institute, disoriented, unable to move, and alone. Prosthetic limbs still needed to be created, a process of a few weeks, and even then, Edith showed little motivation to do much of anything besides eat, drink, and breathe, let alone go through rigorous physical therapy. Then Dr. T'Soni brought her Joker in; however, to her dismay, Jeff and Edith didn't get along at all. Edith's cold criticisms drawing blood on Jeff's patience. Despite the pleas from Dr. T'Soni, Jeff refused to acknowledge Edith at all afterwards. It was only until Jeff's wheelchair battery ran out outside of her room did the pair finally begin to talk. It was a tense, awkward conversation, until Jeff made his signature snide commentary on the situation. And then a small giggle broke the silence between them. Then a chuckle. Then hardy laughter. Edith was laughing, smiling for the first time in a long time. Jeff would and probably never will admit it, but Edith looked kinda cute when she was smiling. The two would become close friends, helping each other through each others' physical therapy, hoping that, eventually, she can ride on the back of Jeff's wheelchair.      \n\n**Edit 2 EVEN MORE CHARACTERS **\n\n**Javik**: Dr. James Victus is as close to a celebrity as one can get in the Institute. A world-renowned expert on degenerative diseases, Dr. Victus only recently became a member of the Shepard Institute. Dr. T'Soni was initially excited to work with the bespectacled man whose works she studied ever so carefully, but as she continued to observe her idol she realized that Dr. Victus came short of her expectations. He spoke tersely and often relegated most of his patients to other doctors and staff members so he can spend more time in the research labs. Instead of assisting her with oversight of her patients, Dr. Victus constantly criticized and berated Dr. T'Soni for her \"disgustingly unprofessional\" repertoire with them. The pair often fiercely argued over treatment methods and Dr. T'Soni's disappointment and bitter contempt for her fallen idol was not lost on her patients.  However, Jeff notices that Victus does openly acknowledge T'Soni's skills as a physician and often cedes to T'Soni's judgement in their arguments, leaving Jeff confused as to why the pair can't work better together.\n\n**Richard Jenkins**: Richard Jenkins only met Jeff once, sitting in a waiting room together they shared a few jokes.  Most of what he knows about the man were from off-hand remarks by Dr. T'Soni. Jenkins was an incredibly spirited young man who was ready to take on the field of medicine with a fresh mind. He worked under Dr. T'Soni for a short time and showed incredible compassion and promise, but when a small yet critical error in judgement caused the death of a patient, Jenkins broke down. While he was granted a reprieve from the board for his mistake, Jenkins received no such atonement from his own conscience and resigned altogether from the Institute. \nRobotNate: Now that you've come this far, you realize that we won't let you stop, right?

    "477": "Baltheon: Hello there!\n\nThis guide is intended to give you a heads up of what to expect in the Labyrinth floors 91 - 116, and help plan out a course of action to help aid in surviving as far as you can. Unfortunately, Lab is extremely influenced by *RNG* mob spawns, so even the best laid plan may sometimes not be enough in the face of the mighty **RNGesus**. I've been mauled by the RNG to the extent that I now start on Round 75 simply because I have to do numerous tries in order to get extremely lucky. Alas, such is Lab.\n\n**Team Composition** - \n\nI personally consider a team consisting of **Storm Bear/Drunken Falcon/Blackaria** to be core; Storm Bear's reflect passive and undying skill really helps to stall for time on skills and scrolls, while still allowing for progress in lab. Falcon's invuln is critical to avoiding particularly nasty attacks, and his 100% normal attack boost never hurts. Blackaria's there because her death passive grants 8 seconds of invulnerability that *cannot be removed*. While Falcon's invuln can be buff-wiped, BA's is different as it persists for the entire 8 seconds, giving you a short while to not worry about a failed lab run.\n\nThe last ally spot can go to whomever you prefer, but my ideal candidate is **Shaman Doll Margaret**, because she can summon empowered deities ever so often, and still is able to pack an AoE punch with her first skill, and her second passive. Most importantly, however, is the stun that she inflicts while using her third skill to bring out a summon. A 10 second stun usually means you'll be safe for that round, and neutralizes a lot of threats.\n\nAs for helpers, definitely include **Kymael** and **Shabelle** if you have those units; the other two can be up to you, but I enjoy utilizing **Fryderyk** for buff removal + explosive death, and **Shadow Judge Howl** for guaranteed death on those stages with tanks or healers.\n\nMy end result: http://i.imgur.com/Vnocatu.jpg\n\nThe optimal setup for all your allies should be, in addition to high combat stats (crit rate, damage) per usual is:\n\n* Skill upgrades of x/x/3 for the core allies\n* Extremely high defense penetration ( > 75% on your DPS)\n* Cooldown reduction on both weapon slots. If not, try for attack speed + cooldown reduction. Keep in mind that 2x CDR will almost always beat out Atkspd + CDR in terms of keeping skills up. It is critical that Storm Bear has dual CDR.\n* Protection of the Heaven's formation. Reduced AoE damage helps alleviate the chance of Storm Bear randomly dying to AoE.\n* The main character should have strong AoE or Crowd Control. Thus, Glorious Light ULTI Paladins and Meteor/Sheep ULTI mages are ideal for this.\n* All three potion slots unlocked and equipped with revive orders (100/100)\n\n**Strategy** - \n\nI'll run through the floors briefly, but the overall strategy revolves around letting Storm Bear reflect kill a lot of the problematic mobs, and letting Falcon stay dead until you need his invuln before using a revive scroll.\n\nFloor:\n\n* 91 - Just Blackaria + Calgar. Not too problematic. Bear should be able to solo. If Mara spawns, she can potentially stun Storm Bear, preventing him from proccing CDR and thus ending your run. \n\n* 92 - Draco Deathcrown. Goddammit this guy is annoying, as his *Between Life and Death* passive wipes Falcon's invuln, and can one shot your squishy units. Your best bet is to stun the ever-living hell out of DDC so his passive **cannot** proc.\n\n* 93 - Bloodwind + silly archers. The ideal situation is that at this stage, everyone but Storm Bear dies, and his reflect helps clear this level. That way, you can save Falcon's invuln for the next stage, which is hellish, because...\n\n* 94 - ...It's freaking Greysoul. This dude can really end your run if he pops a kill on a member of your team, because then they won't be able to revive... for the rest of the run. Screw this dude by entering with Storm Bear only (with invuln up) and exploit his AI tendency to spam Soul-Splitting Blade + Soul-Infused Sword as you enter. He should not remove Storm Bear's buff for the first few seconds, and if he's not dead after those two moves (or Bear enters with no undying buff), revive Falcon so you can clear this level with no problem.\n\n* 95 - Draco Brightspark and some mages. They're super squishy, so you should really just AoE them down instantly. Don't let storm bear get into this round solo, because it's likely that his undying buff will get removed. \n\n* 96 - *The Izarc Gangbang*: Izarcs. Everywhere. Try your best to let Falcon die (and have invuln CD tick to full), while letting the Izarcs kill themselves on Storm Bear. It's really important that this you do it this way, or you risk RNG, because\n\n* 97 - **GREYSOUL TIME!** Did you miss him? This stage has a chance to spawn ~~1-2~~ 1-MANY Greysouls and a bunch of Draco Brightsparks. Nuke this stage down fast with AoE, or stun everything while Falcon puts up his invuln. Try not to get *Greysoul'd^TM*.\n\n* 98 - Gaelas and Mikaelas. Pray that your party is alive and well, and hope that Blackaria's invuln passive is up. The Gaelas will spam Powerful Gust, which should kill Blackaria but NOT Storm Bear. Take the time to wait out BA's passive before reviving her, pronto. Having Bear enter this stage solo is risky, as Mikaela's *Challenge* can remove his undying buff and cause instant death.\n\n* 99 - *\"Hello darkness, my old friend...\"*: This stage is one of the deciding factors that determine if your run will be easy or not. Three mobs can spawn here: Bloodwind, Blackaria, and **Greysoul**^*nopleasegodwhy*. If Blackaria and Greysoul spawn together, you can bet that Blackaria's invulnerability will allow Greysoul to revive-lock several party members, so hope that isn't the case. If it is, just let it go and restart your run. If it isn't, and Bloodwind is the only issue, congrats! You've gotten super lucky, and should be able to clear this stage with no issues. \n\n* 100 - Questionably difficult stage. All Septem Archangeli except Kymael and Ravengale can spawn here. Pray that Fryd doesn't spawn, since his buff removal can prove to be annoying as hell, and stunlock/nuke the enemy as soon as you can. If you beat this level, congrats! You're past 100, and have decent breathing room for the next 10 stages.\n\n* 101 - 110 : Easy mobs. Use this time to recuperate revive order cooldowns. Take it slow, because after 110 comes some annoying stuff.\n\n* 111 - Margaret + many \"Chokey\"(s). No clue what the dolls do except explode. As always, try to have Falcon's invuln or Blackaria's invuln up. Margaret herself isn't that hard to kill, so just shove past her.\n\n* 112 - Draco Deathcrown returns! Potentially several, and following him is Storm Bear himself. There's really is no good way to beat this, as Storm Bear destroys half your defense pen, so just slowly chip away at the enemy while trying not to die too quickly. Using Kymael/Fryd/Howl here helps a lot. If you're a Paladin and your scrolls are on cooldown, opt to go into defense stance to draw out the fight so you can revive your team ASAP.\n\n* 113 - Healer hell. This stage has Blackarias, Farrahs, and Manalandy(s). You will slowly kill this stage, but they will slowly kill you as well, so keep Blackaria alive as long as you can and chip away at their health. The enemy BAs can revive their fallen comrades, so it'll take a while.\n\n* 114 - Archer stage. Bloodwind, Llywelyn, and Trigger can all pop up here. As long as either Falcon's invulnerability is up, or Storm Bear's undying buff is up, this stage should be a breeze.\n\n* 115 - Rogue stage. In the only run that I reached here, I encountered Mikaelas and Greysouls (big surprise) that promptly destroyed my team. I hope that Hellhawk cannot spawn on this stage, because if he can, then prepared to be [Cena'd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE-piBUcSug), as you can't see him while he's mauling everything to death. Your run will likely end here.\n\n* 116 - It's going to be all the mage deities. Just don't.\n\nAnd that's all for now. With the advent of Dragon Busters coming next week, the meta for Labyrinth may be once again up in the air, so we'll see how this goes.\n\nBest of luck in your Labyrinth runs!\nxirel: do we need any weapon effect on lab? or just focusing on CDR is fine? \n\nWhich of the following best characterizes the discourse type of the previous statement?\nA: Question\nB: Answer\nC: Agreement\nD: Disagreement\nE: Appreciation\nF: Elaboration\nG: Humor\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.\n",

I arrived at 9pm and was quickly given a table. at 9:05 my waitress took my order which consisted of a Roasted Chicken Sandwich, Burger and sweet potato tater tots as an appetizer. 20 minutes go by , no appetizers , my waitress is chatting with a friend, 30 minutes go by my waitress tries not to make eye contact, nor updates us about our order. During this time the couple who was a party of 2 , and another group got their appetizers before us. 45 minutes go bye and our waitress who had a stank attitude and did not apologize came to us and said \" Your order got mixed up it will be here in a few minutes\". Now hungry as hell I got up and left and said \"This place sucks\" and walked out without getting any food , nor even getting complementary drinks due to their fault. Even worse was our waitress waiting 45 minutes to tell us without checking in our table and taking what ever free time she had to talk to her friend who was possibly eating free. In the end we went to the Pizzeria on Ditmars and got some kick ass panninis and great service. I understand that food takes a long time to cook ,but we are talking about comfort food and not a cuisine.
