313,A,"I wasn't expecting this and it's drained my finances waiting for the second check, which will be here next week."
314,B,I'm hoping a kind redditor can help me make it to then.
315,C,All I have to offer is I will help someone at some future date in need.
316,G,This isn't for me but I have a friend who is in need but isn't a redditor.
317,A,(That I know of).
318,A,He became unemployed a couple weeks ago and he has barely enough food to keep his weight up.
319,G,I am broke as hell and can't help him at the moment.
320,D,Probably make my mom really happy as well.
321,A,"I'm in Los Angeles, CA, 90002

Made a lot of mistakes in my life honestly, been stuck in my own head afraid to go out for years."
322,A,Put a lot of pressure on my family to take care of me because I was an idiot.
323,A,That's changed recently and I'm trying to get on my feet but it isn't going well so far and it's honestly doing my head in a bit.
324,D,A pizza right now would be a Godsend and honestly relieve some pressure for a few days.
325,F,As always i'm having a tough time and no food in the house.
326,A,"Hell, I'm fat."
327,A,Want a pic of us both having a big binge.
328,A,I'm down almost 50 pounds this year!
329,B,Go me.
330,G,I'll probably forget about this anyways :)
331,A,"Chillin in Alaska, really craving a pizza."
332,A,"No story, just wishing I could have a full stomach of pizza."
333,A,"By all means, choose the guy above me, or below me."
334,A,Doesnt really phase me otherwise.
335,A,Edit: papa John's is the closest.
336,A,The brakes in my car blew out yesterday and we typically go buy supplies on Sunday.
337,A,But with an unknown repair cost (gonna be caliper rotor and a brake line in my rear passenger wheel at least and an suv $$) I don't want to chance paying for an uber and not having the funds to get my car up and running tomorrow.
338,A,"I have frozen Brussels sprouts and eggs, neither of which my 7 year old will touch lol."
339,B,Thank you.
340,A,"My deviant art, its old but its a good example of what I do:"
341,A,My day's been pretty okay despite being broke and nearly out of food.
342,A,Then I get a ticket because I forgot about street cleaning.
343,A,So I guess you could say I'm a starving artist?
344,C,"Anyways, I'm an art student and I've got nothing to do for the rest of the day so I'll draw something for whoever would give me some pizza."

412,D,"That's not too bad for us, but it would be nice to give her a meal other than noodles for her birthday and we could probably make a pizza last a few days for her if the fiance and I ate some noodles instead."
413,B,Thanks for taking the time to read!
414,A,Edit: I forgot to include pizza places near us.
415,C,"will pass pizza-love on as soon as I am paid, because we all know pizza runs the universe."

426,A,So I have a couple of friends in my home state (WV) who are pretty down on their luck right now and could use a pizza.
427,A,They are rooming together in a small apartment and only one of them is currently employed (though the other is looking for a job).
428,A,"However, they can barely afford to eat."
429,A,I was talking to one of them and he said that he's resorted to eating a tortilla shell with some condiments on it because it's all he's got because they can't go shopping until the other gets paid (he's had the job less than a week now).
430,A,"(I'm literally 3$short from being able to buy a pizza myself online)


(Edit: bot told me to include chains near me: Dominos, papa John's, Benitos, cottage inn USA)"
431,A,Tonight after work me and my girlfriend where leaving the parking garage but the card reading machine to get out of the lot decided it was going to scratch the fuck out of my credit card to the point where it's unreadable even thought I just put gas on the car before work.
432,A,"So I'm out of a credit card, don't get paid until Tuesday, and have a really upset gf."
433,D,Literally a plain cheese pizza from anywhere would make our night not so shit.
434,C,"Once I get a new card I would pay it forward x2, If only Meijer accepted PayPal this wouldn't be a issue."
435,E,I'm utterly sick.
436,E,"I don't really know what to say here, I just feel so shitty."
437,A,"I usually just use Reddit for memes and stuff, I've tried this a couple times before but haven't gotten any replies."
438,A,"My best friend killed herself the other night, she was the most important person in my world."
439,A,I've never had to go through something like this.
440,B,"Little help, random blokes off t'internet?"

446,A,I just got clean from a 6 year opiate addiction a week and a half ago.
447,A,I'm still right in the thick of withdrawals and got fired from my job when I had to call out because of them.

459,A,"Anyways, the stars aligned and I have a day off, so with this in mind, I was hoping someone here would be willing to send a pizza my way."
460,G,Is there something me and my friends can do to convince a kind redditor with the resources to afford a large pizza to throw us a bone?
461,A,Just me and a couple friends hanging out watching television.
462,A,We are pretty much on our last dime (only consistent job is a gas station attendant who puts his money to rent).
463,D,"We aren't starving, we aren't a sad story, but we can't afford pizza... a pizza which would just make our night."

496,A,My friend and I will be studying for finals for many hours this weekend.

501,A,"He's in the navy and we are barely scraping by, there aren't a lot of jobs available in our small desert town so funds are super low."

885,F,I have absolutely no food and won't until Friday at the earliest.
886,A,"I just got moved into a new apartment, and unfortunately there really isn't much in the way of food assistance I can get at the moment."
887,C,"Friday is my first payday in ages, and I'm willing to pay it forward if someone can just help me out, I can make pizza last a while with leftovers and whatnot so I can at least eat until then."
888,A,"i was a stay at home mom, but now i am looking for a job so that me and my kids can get toiletries and basic supplies."
889,A,"my parents are still in the picture, but they dont understand why i dont try to reconnect with my husband, who i havent even spoke to and cannot find."
890,E,"they sent my children diapers, but im low on those now."
891,D,all i am looking for is pizza for tonight it would make my kids day and cheer them up.
892,A,"this is my first time on this site, but i thought i should give it a try because i am really struggling."
893,A,my husband of 4 years walked out on me and the kids almost a month ago.
894,A,he got a new job and just up and left.
895,A,"we had a joint bank account and that all that has been feeding me and the kids, but now he transferred most of the money out of it and we have nothing."
896,A,We have been eating small meals and basic stuff for ages and have not gone out or ordered since July.
897,A,"This is usually fine, but today, I had to spend a few hours on the bus/train and walk around in the rain to go to interviews, plus I was gone over lunch time and there was not anything I could pack with me that didn't need a microwave, so I didn't eat anything until I came home just now."
898,A,And what we had to eat was just a leftover serving of instant potatoes.
899,A,"Between running around and the delay in eating the lunch today, I am still really hungry, but all the other food is budgeted so that we can make it to Friday and still have food other times."
900,A,"This is so embarrassing, but I am actually (almost) a bona fide lawyer."
901,A,"I find out if I pass the bar the first week in October, and I had two interviews today and have another on Tuesday."
902,A,"Which is great, but because I am job-searching, most of our money goes to rent, the car, and our pets (they are rescue animals so we don't want to abandon them again)."
903,A,"I don't have the wealthier background a lot of young lawyers do, so we can't rely on my parents, and my spouse's family is even poorer."
904,A,"When I first was diagnosed, I tried to eat gluten-free pizzas - they were all absolutely terrible, and I just gave up."
905,A,"I'm appealing to you guys, now."
906,A,"**Pizza used to be my favorite food, and now I can't eat it."
907,A,"**  I live in Brooklyn, NY."
908,A,"So, last summer I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease."
909,A,"It's an autoimmune disorder where the body freaks out over gluten, a protein in wheat, barley and rye (And most processed foods, due to cross-contamination in factories)."
910,A,"Since then, I haven't been able to eat most breads, nor gluten-free foods processed in facilities where they might have gotten contaminated by something that contains gluten."
911,A,"Obviously, this means pizza's out."
912,A,My account balance says think again.
913,C,"I've never done this before, and the instructions encourage askers to trade something."
914,C,"My talents are limited, but I can write you a limerick, draw you a stupid picture or send a photo of my evil cat."
915,B,Thank you pizza gods
916,G,There we have it.
917,A,I have a roof over my head and a shirt on my back for which I am grateful.
918,E,But fuck me it's been a long and exhausting week.
919,A,I would absolutely love a pizza right now.
920,B,If anyone can lend a hand it'd be greatly appreciated.
921,A,"I know it's a lot to ask, seeing as how there are five of us in total."
922,A,But I figured it wouldn't hurt to try!
923,B,I hope you all have a great evening.
924,A,"Hello everyone, I lost my job just before Christmas, and things have been kinda tight around these parts."
925,A,"Bills take priority, and all."
926,A,Decent paying jobs are seeming farther and further in between.
927,A,"The kiddos (3), asked for pizza for dinner, but the bank balance says otherwise."
928,B,"If anyone can help, I would gladly appreciate it!"
929,C,Also I can draw you a little pizza doodle it you want!
930,A,"I'm located in MI, USA, btw."
931,B,Thanks in advance!
932,F,"Hey guys, so it's Saturday night and I have nothing to eat right now."
933,A,"My dining hall closed at 5pm, there is nothing in walking distance around me."
934,A,"Of course, even if there was, I have no money."
935,E,I'm really hungry and I can't sleep it off unfortunately.
936,G,The reason why I even mention this is so you know I'm a real redditor and not some random outsider trying to exploit your generosity.
937,A,I'm not using my real account name for reasons I will thoroughly explain if you IM me.
938,G,Even if you don't plan on helping me.
939,A,"Finally, what I **can** explain here in the open is this: I've lost 15lbs in ~1 week due to not eating."
940,A,"First things first, this is a sock puppet account."
941,G,"Second things second, I do have a reputable **real** account and I will talk to you on that account if you private message me first on this one."
942,A,I'm the creator/mod of a top 50 most active subreddit (according to [subredditfinder](http://subredditfinder.com/)).
943,A,"It's also in the top 100 in most subscribed, fastest rising, and other categories."
944,B,Thank you to everyone who makes people's days/nights better with such a kind gesture.
945,C,"If I'm lucky enough to get one, a thank you photo will for sure follow."
946,A,"EDIT: the post reminded me, I have Extreme Pizza, Dominos, and Pizza Hut in my area."
947,A,Also I noticed people posting their zip codes so I figured I'd add it if I missed needing to post it: 94928 (Northern California)
948,A,"I feel embarrassed begging or giving a sob story (I am in need, but feel like I'm guilting people into feeding me (which I have zero issue with others explaining their situation, just a personal thing)), so I'd like to forgo that and in an act of theme-ing since I'm re-reading ADWD as we speak, wanted to stare into the fires of Reddit and see if I could find a Lord of Light to bring me some joy during this cold winter night."
949,A,"The pizza that was promised prophecy, I hear it was born amidst feta and smoke."
950,A,"I am a fan of the TV Show, but I'm obsessed with the books."
951,A,"I very much appreciate and take the subreddit seriously, but again even though I'm having issues listing them in hopes it will get me a pizza over someone else here with either the same kinds of problems or worse made me feel uncomfortable."
952,A,"I was saving a little aside for his birthday, but unfortunately since I work on commission, it didn't come through the past two weeks."
953,A,I only had money to pay bills and rent.
954,A,I was hoping anyone that had a spare moment and some cash could help me buy a pizza for him this afternoon.
955,A,We can even consider it a loan.
956,A,"Hi all,

My fiance dreads his birthday."
957,A,I was really excited to make it the best birthday I could.
958,A,"Unfortunately, the cards did not fall that way."
959,A,"Recently we've been going paycheck to paycheck with the little we have over going to food, and lawyers fees (custody battle)."
960,A,Not sure what the hell I'm going to do about that.
961,A,"I may be able to return to my job as a server in a couple of days, but I sure could use some food to tide me over until then."
962,A,"I sold an item on eBay, but now that person is telling me they won't be able to pay me for two weeks."
963,G,Wonderful.
964,A,I broke my arm Christmas Eve.
965,A,I haven't worked since then.
966,A,"I just got back from my first check up with my orthopedic surgeon, and he says everything looks alright."
967,A,"However, I just received a medical bill for my anesthesia yesterday for $1440."
968,A,Then he drops the bomb that he can't afford me anymore.
969,A,I am not this person.
970,G,I'm not.
971,A,But I don't have parents to turn to or friends to help me out.
972,A,"Look, I don't even know how to go about doing this."
973,A,I've never been caught so bare as I am currently.
974,A,My employer let me go Friday after barely four months of working there.
975,A,And I have been so aggressive with paying my debt down that I don't have a savings to fall back on.
976,A,"I can do electronic, hip-hop, blues, rock, doom metal, black metal, world/ethnic, orchestral pieces, 80s synth pop, ambient, almost anything really."
977,C,"If desired, I could sing a name, tagline, or slogan and do it jingle style or even use crazy robot voice effects."
978,C,I could also mimic a specific artists style.
979,A,[Here are some examples of my production.
980,A,Ive been eating nothing but rice and when im lucky ramen for almost 4 months now since being laid off from my computer repair gig.
981,G,"I live in Alaska where the economy and culture is about 4-5 years delayed from the rest of the US so the recession is only now starting to really take hold here, as such Ive been unable to find any regular work even at any of the typical franchised fast food joints."
982,C,"BUT I can make music, so if there is any kind of song you have ever wanted to hear or have made for yourself, a loved one, a personal project, or perhaps a video or web-series of yours; tell me about it and I will make it happen for a pizza."
983,A,"Preferably a pizza with meat on it, I literally have dreams of meat and cheese these days."
984,A,I can't cook or store any food in this situation.
985,A,I would LOVE a change of pace.
986,A,"You don't even have to deliver, I'd go pick it up."
987,A,Couldn't tip the driver anyway.
988,B,Hi Reddit.
989,A,"As the post says, I am currently homeless and sleeping in my car."
990,A,"I'm looking for work, parked next to Wifi, hoping from spot to spot."
991,A,I am down to the change in my console and have been eating nothing but dollar store beef stew and Kroger's daily bread for the past 2 months.
992,F,"A bit of an update, I won't be able to get food until Tuesday."
993,A,My TAP card (which my housing program gave me) had a bit of an issue and can't be used until then.
994,A,"Meaning, no food bank."
995,G,"[Here's a link so you think I'm pulling a sob story here](  )

Okay, I guess I have to make this longer or give an essay on what pizza means to me."
996,E,I'm sad and hungry with nothing in the cupboards.
997,A,It'll get better later on in the week at least.
998,A,There's a Dominos near here.
999,A,I live in LA btw.
1000,A,"We don't really ever leave the house, and she has been not feeling well the past few days."
1001,E,So I'm kind of insane from no sleep/ constant crying.
1002,G,~[`_°]~ ...
1003,A,"I'm not starving, we have some plain rice and spinach, but a pizza souneded amazing and money is very tight until I start work again."
1004,B,hello:) I never knew about this place!
1005,B,you guys seem awesome.
1006,A,Well I just had a baby almost 2 months ago.
1007,A,Also my car just broke down.
1008,G,Anyway!
1009,A,"Yeah, there is no sob story here."
1010,A,"We paid our rent this past Friday, we got groceries, and we filled up the cars with gas to last us for the next 2 weeks until we're paid again."
1011,A,"Needless to say, we aren't in desperate need or anything."
1012,A,"We're located in upstate SC, and the only place we have is a Pizza Hut and they don't deliver (blah!)"
1013,G,"We've given quite a few times before, and we've received twice before."
1014,A,"The last one received was a long time ago, maybe almost a year or something?"
1015,G,"Not sure, but it's been awhile!"
1016,A,"After 6 consistent days, I received reddit gold for one of the answers I provided for someone!"
1017,A,This was an awesome achievement and greatly motivates me to continue on with my current goal.
1018,A,"That said, I've used this service before and was hoping it would come through once again."
1019,B,"A pizza would be greatly appreciated, but is in no way expected."
1020,B,Hey guys!
1021,A,"So for the past week and a half, I've been getting serious in my pursuits of becoming a life coach or therapist of sorts to help people achieve greater things for themselves."
1022,A,"In this pursuit, I took to r/getdisciplined and made the commitment to answer at least 1 question everyday."
1023,A,"Both to help someone out who feels lost, while also getting better at explaining personal philosophies and experiences that have helped me better myself."
1024,D,I think a surprise pizza would get him out of bed.
1025,D,and make me feel a little better.
1026,A,EDIT: He's still in bed 3 hours later.
1027,A,"Dominoes/Pizza Hut E-gift cards are the easiest as they're within walking distance for me, but we do have a Papa Johns in delivery range."
1028,E,Not having a good day.
1029,A,Check we were expecting last week (that we kinda need.)
1030,A,is a week late-- we believe it may have been stolen at this point.
1031,A,Hubby is depressed and appears to be attempting to stay in bed all day because of it.
1032,B,New to this sub so I'm sorry if something is formatted wrong.
1033,E,Edit: I forgot to say fuck student loans and health care debt.
1034,A,Edit2: I'm in WI in the USA.
1035,A,"I have Pizza Hut, Dominos, Marcos, Toppers, and Papa Johns near me."
1036,A,My roommate is out of town with family and hadn't paid their share of rent.
1037,A,"My dad, now in the hospital, rents the basement, but hasn't worked weeks and also hasn't paid his share of rent."
1038,A,After covering their asses this early in the month it's either gas for work or a decent meal.
1039,A,"I have some ramen noodles, crackers, jelly and some pancake mix along with random canned food, so I'm not gonna die, but I'd really love a real meal before Friday."
1040,A,"On Friday nights, we have a tradition -- my kids are allowed to watch a movie and we eat pizza -- it's the only night of the week they get to do either; an attempt to give them some predictability."
1041,A,"Unfortunately, [pending my October student loan payment to post](  ), [I will have $11 in my bank account](  )."
1042,A,"On top of that, with the late hour of the interview, even if I had the money to buy a take-and-bake pizza from Costco, I wouldn't have time to pick one up, before I get the kids from after-school (because of my interview)."
1043,B,"*Help me, Random Acts Of Pizza, you're my only hope*."
1044,A,"**My life has become surreal**: I was forced out of my job in August, I'm in the midst of a separation (NC requires 366 days, which will be October 15, before you can file), [my unemployment claim was denied](  ), [my student loan payment doubled in August for reasons they won't explain](  ), [a scratch on my cuticle has become a month-long infection of my ring finger that has cost me $500, so far, and could lead to amputation](  ) (I don't qualify for healthcare subsidies because of last year's taxes and without unemployment, I don't qualify for medicaid), if it doesn't clear up, my car recently died (I fixed it - $600 in parts) and my not-yet-ex-wife was diagnosed with breast cancer two weeks ago, today."
1045,A,"*Frankly, if I wasn't living it, I wouldn't believe it was happening*."
1046,A,"**Things aren't all-bad**: I had a job interview on Tuesday and they've asked for a second-round, next week; I have a different interview today, at the end of the business day."
1047,A,"My kids (6 and 9) are healthy (they don't know about the cancer yet) and I should be able to cover my mortgage, before it becomes ""late"" on the 15th, because I've dipped into my retirement, just waiting for the deposit, sometime, next week."
1048,A,"(Pizza hut, dominos, papa johns.)"
1049,A,There are three adults and two hungry kids.
1050,G,Anyone who doubts my story can check my history to get a better idea of our story.
1051,B,(Check my popular submitted posts) Thank you for reading.
1052,A,"Long story short, my disabled mothers rent check bounced due to some emergency hospital bills and my sister and I pooled our resources to keep her from getting evicted."
1053,A,Problem is that nobody has any money for anything until next Friday.
1054,D,Pizza would be an awesome thing to brighten up this day.
1055,A,"There is a Mazzios across the street, and a brothers pizza (no online ordering) next door, but all the major chains are close by."
1056,A,Except for times like these when said clumsiness (d?
1057,A,)evolves into my convenient little wrist bag  fly off my wrist and tumble down the mountain...in what can only be described as heartbreaking slow motion.
1058,A,So I'm stuck.
1059,A,Park Rangers were very helpful with bandaids for my knee and the front desk was gracious enough to provide me a replacement key-free of charge.
1060,A,"So, I'm in a hotel in Palm Springs, Ca."
1061,A,Just kinda kicking it while my kids get to spend the wknd with their dad.
1062,A,"Decided to go explore a bit, the mountains and scenery are beautiful and the triple digit temps have faded, thank the Gods!"
1063,A,"Now, I'm simply a clumsy person but I don't let that stop me."
1064,C,"Or, if requested, I could also attempt to compose a pizza themed poem that follows the above mentioned stipulations as well."
1065,A,Sorry if I don't respond to anyone until perhaps after 6:45pm or so Eastern Standard Time due to work (can't have phone on the floor and the internet is super locked down).
1066,A,I may be able to sneak onto my phone during my next break.
1067,G,We'll have to see.
1068,A,First paycheck from my new job hits not tomorrow but the following Friday.
1069,A,Would gladly accept some Dominoes or Pizza Hut (it's what in my area) to grab on my way home this evening.
1070,A,"Will draw, quite terribly (not on purpose) whatever you require of me on the pizza box for my verification post so long as it isn't, you know, racist, sexist, misogynist, etc."
1071,G,Nothing overtly offensive.
1072,B,We would REALLY appreciate it.
1073,A,"I live in Lapeer, Michigan."
1074,C,I will try my best to definitely pay it forward when I can.
1075,C,"I have given a gift to someone before on another sub, and I'd love to give a pizza away when possible."
1076,B,Hi there!
1077,A,I just found out about this subreddit.
1078,A,"There's nothing in my house but noodles, but there's no sauce or anything."
1079,F,My girlfriend and I and my mother haven't eaten anything all day and that's all we've got and we really cannot afford to order a pizza.
1080,A,Unfortunately all of our spare money goes into the business and something like pizza isn't in the budget.
1081,A,"I would love to pick up pizza or pasta on my way home this evening, I know it would absolutely make my wife's birthday and frankly it would move me to tears to see her smile."
1082,C,"When our business takes off, you will see me return to repay the happiness afforded to my family previously and hopefully today."
1083,A,"We are in the Denver area and will eat pretty much anything, no complaints here when it comes to food."
1084,A,"Hello,

I know this is a long shot, but tomorrow is my wife's birthday."
1085,A,"In the last eighteen months, we relocated for my health and it cost our family dearly financially."
1086,A,My wife works sixty hour weeks and I myself have been doing close to a hundred working to restart my small business.
1087,A,In September we have a massive show and we have been crazy busy preparing for it.
1088,A,I seriously hope it works.
1089,A,"We've been trying to get regular birth control for *months,* but all we seem to do is struggle with the insurance company."
1090,A,Just a little good news would be nice.
1091,A,"Even if it's just ""yes I'll buy you a pizza."""
1092,A,I run a struggling small business in southwest Ohio.
1093,A,"Things aren't going so well, but I'm pretty certain once I get a nice clientele they'll ease up."
1094,A,"I live in an apartment with my girlfriend... between the two of us we struggle to pay for food, and suddenly I have a terrible cold (my fever just broke 100 degrees, and I've had fluid in my lungs a couple times... hoping it's not walking pneumonia), meaning working is impossible for me."
1095,A,"On top of that, just before the cold we had a condom break on us, so the money that would have gone to a copay to the doctor's office instead went to buying a morning after pill."
1096,G,You can see my post history that I've been here for a while.
1097,G,I've pics and personal information so I'm not trying to scam anyone.
1098,A,Just throwing feelers out for them where ever I can think to ask to see if any help comes from it.
1099,B,Thanks!
1100,A,I don't have the funds to help my friend but figured there was no harm in asking here.
1101,A,Worst that comes from it nothing happens.
1102,D,Best that comes from it they get pizza.
1103,A,"The family is a grandma, her daughter and her daughter's 4 kids."

1108,B,Hello!
1109,A,This is my first time posting here.
1110,A,My girlfriend is unemployed and was recently kicked out of her grandfather's house.
1111,A,She's looking for a job but for right now but I'm hoping someone here could help her out on the food front.
1112,C,"Need some IT work done, remotely?"
1113,A,I also root phones.
1114,C,I can also pay it forward then.
1115,A,I posted in both subs.
1116,A,I screwed up and overdrew my account when paying a bill.
1117,F,Haven't eaten since saturday evening so I could use a pizza to help the next three days move by without the hunger pangs.
1118,D,This would help me out tremendously until I can pay my fees and go by groceries.
1119,A,I don't have much or much to offer but I am extremely tech savvy.
1120,A,You wouldn't guess it by looking at us but we could eat a pizza a piece if some generous member ofr royalty had that kind of money to patronize us with.
1121,A,"This is barter town, and we are 100% willing to work!"
1122,B,"Please take a chance and send us a PM, you won't regret it!"
1123,A,"sorry this sounds so much like an advertisement, we are super hungry and the thought of pizza hut is making us a liiitle bit crazy"
1124,C,"Hello,

What would you like in exchange for a Pizza Hut gift code?"
1125,C,"We'll take pictures of whatever you can think of, draw, sing, make fools of ourselves in whatever way makes you happy."
1126,E,We are super hungry!
1127,A,"We have seven bucks but no gas, so we could walk to Pizza Hut and spend seven bucks on something, but I know it won't feed both of us."
1128,C,"Not a great artist, but if you want me to draw something for you, I can try."
1129,C,"I can also crochet, and do other crafting related things, so I could maybe make you a hat or something."
1130,B,Any help is appreciated!
1131,B,Thanks in advance.
1132,A,"Broke college student studying for finals, that has $0.13 to his name at the moment."

1134,C,"Once I get a job and some extra money, I'll pay it forward."
1135,A,I just want some food other than rice or ramen for once.
1136,A,"It's cold, I just got home from a *long* day and I will definitely stretch it out as I'm definitely a bit sparse until my first check!"
1137,A,I've received here once quite a while back through a contest and will certainly be a different kind of frequenter once I get settled in this stellar job.
1138,B,I hope you all are having a wonderful evening despite a rocky day around the world.
1139,B,Thanks :)
1140,A,"Howdy folks,
After being laid off from my last job - much to my dismay at the time, as I adored the place and the people - I have spent the two weeks since applying to every place in my immediate area."
1141,A,"Being so close to the holidays, I was worried I would not be able to find a position at all, nonetheless one I would be happy with."
1142,A,"I lucked out *big time* and scored a wonderful position that not only pays better and offers better hours, but where I can already tell I *love* the people."
1143,A,"In celebration, it would be really amazing to have some warm food tonight!"
1144,A,"Unfortunately due to my rent being due on the 1st, and my unemployment check not yet processing because of the weekend, I am down to pennies in my account, along with an empty fridge."
1145,D,"It's just myself, I don't need much, but a warm pizza could really cheer me up tonight."
1146,C,Of course I will absolutely pay it forward the second I can.
1147,A,I'm located in Los Angeles.
1148,E,"Hey everyone,

I'm at a pretty low point right now."
1149,A,I was let go from my job at a small company back in September as a video editor.
1150,A,I've been looking for work ever since but have yet to get past the first interview process.
1151,A,"I do have two interviews coming up a week from tomorrow that I am really excited for, though."
1152,A,So that would be 2 adults and 6 children from 13-5 years old.
1153,A,(I'm leaving myself out as I do not want a meal provided for me).
1154,B,"I know this is a lot to ask for,  but I would be eternally greatful and if things do turn around for me you will be paid back."
1155,B,Thank you in advance.
1156,A,Things changed since I posted a request yesterday.
1157,A,The person that has let me stay at her house needs me out after this weekend.
1158,D,"I have lunch for my kids taken care of,  but would love to have some surprise pizza for their dinner as this is likely the last time I will be able to spend a large amount of time with them until I get on my feet."
1159,A,"If at all possible I would like to also have some for my friend that let me stay,  her boyfriend,  and her oldest child (the other is too young for pizza)."
1160,A,My Grammy passed away suddenly from complications from lung cancer on January 11th.
1161,E,Being alone in WA meant a very complicated and extended grieving process as I couldn't get down to Oregon until the day before the funeral.
1162,A,"Came back up and found that on top of my car being broken down, my tire went flat as it sat there completely still and parked meaning I'll have to get it fixed and replace a tire now."
1163,A,Then yesterday I was on Skype with my boyfriend who is an Airman and already far away in Omaha and he got orders.
1164,B,"Hey Redditors,

It has been awhile since I've been on here."
1165,E,January has been a really rough month and I'm just having a pretty crap day.
1166,A,Here's how January went for me.
1167,A,"Car broke down at the beginning of the month, which means I've been busing until payday on Friday."
1168,A,I start on Monday and won't get my first check for at least 3 weeks.
1169,E,I've been so down in the dumps wondering where my next meal would come from or how I would even get it.
1170,A,I've come from having a furnished living space to bare walls and a dream of being able to support myself again.
1171,E,I thought about committing suicide because I just couldn't see any end in sight to this.
1172,A,Throwaway for obvious reasons.
1173,A,"So, I finally got a job!!!"
1174,D,I really want to celebrate with my friends and keep my spirits up.
1175,B,I would love whoever could hook us up with a pizza please.
1176,D,Would make going to work tomorrow so much easier.
1177,B,Reddit is the best!
1178,G,I can PM details and proof if you want.
1179,B,Thanks RAOP!
1180,B,"Hey ROAP, I've been lurking here for quite a while and finally have decided to ask for some help."
1181,A,I am currently about 40 dollars in the hole in my bank account (miscalculation of bills) and hardly any food in the house.
1182,A,I could sure use a fresh hot pizza tonight!
1183,C,I can pay it ~~back~~ forward when I get paid.
1184,A,"**

Note: We do not intend on using any sent pizza as a bribe, if there is enough to share with our small class of 15 people (it's an alternative high school) we will."
1185,A,We believe we have a solid argument and the pizza will be delicious evidence :).
1186,B,Thank you /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza for your time!
1187,A,"Contact information:

1188,B,"Good day kind folk of /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza;

As stated in the title, my class is holding a debate on the true nature of man, good or evil- myself and half of the class on the 'good' side, the other half on the 'evil' side."
1189,A,"While myself and my peers discussed various properties of our assigned moral alignment, the concept of charity came up in discussion- and some of us being redditors, we immediately thought of this subreddit."
1190,A,"It would be greatly appreciated if someone could send us a pizza of any size and type (preferably something generic) around 8:35AM PST, October 13th, and hopefully inspire our pessimistic peers to see past the idiocy and greed omnipresent in our media and wall street and realize that there is such thing as pure human charity."
1191,C,"**We remain committed to returning the favour to the subreddit as well, to an equal or greater value than the sent pizza :)."
1192,A,"So far water has tasted great but brace yourself, the hunger pains are coming!"
1193,E,"I guess i'll just be serious and say, my life sucks right now and between the bills and the stress I need help."
1194,A,Usually I'm the optimistic one but i'd really like to feel that way again.
1195,B,"Thank you for taking the time to read this, have a great night!"
1196,B,Hello there!
1197,A,I am currently out of work dealing with multiple bills and  a horrid court ordeal at the moment.
1198,A,I'm in the Houston area and would prefer a job offer but dinner would seriously make my night right now.
1199,A,All I've got in the pantry is spices and water.
1200,A,"Stealth edit:
*friend bought me some food cuz He's amazing, don't want or need any food, thanks!"
1201,A,"*


So, let me preface this with saying I *am not* in desperate need of food, I have ramen and while I could add some cash to my meal plan, it's not feasible for me right now as I've got about $20 in my checking account right now and don't want to spend it unless I need to."
1202,A,Just posting this so I'm not being disingenuous and you know I'll be just fine without pizza.
1203,C,"-Anyways, if you've made it this far and thought ""hell, I could give  an engineering student some pizza"", then yeah, I'm an engineering student at a school in Virginia and we've got some exams coming up."
1204,B,Cheers!
1205,B,Thanks regardless!
1206,A,"If you think someone needs pizza more than I, give it to them, dammit!-

Edit cuz bot: o yeah, lotsa pizza places around me, cuz college town, like pizza hut or dominos"
1207,B,Hey all!!
1208,A,My fiancé and I just bought a house and are in the process of moving in.
1209,F,We've been go-go-going the last 2 weeks to get moved in before our lease on our apartment expires in 2 weeks.
1210,A,"That being said, we would love a pizza so badly, especially because our kitchen isn't unpacked yet."
1211,A,Both dominos and Pizza Hut are right nearby!
1212,C,"Plus, we'll provide cute pictures of our cats and doggo!"
1213,B,Thanks!

1215,A,"Between car payments and housing, I'm at about 48cents in my back account right now."
1216,A,I'm hungry and just got home from a nice 10-hour shift and I was hoping someone out there would be willing to feed me.
1217,C,I'll return the favor or pay it forward anyway I possibly can.
1218,C,Any redditor in the Orlando area wanna get into Disney for free?
1219,C,I'll hook you up.

1230,A,"Pretty self-explanatory, really."
1231,A,"This is my first request ever, and hopefully my last."
1232,A,"No cash, no cards, and really craving pizza."
1233,B,Any scouse lovers out there wanting to help?
1234,B,:) I'd really appreciate it.
1235,A,"I lived with my now ex-SO and now that he's gone, I'm stuck paying for everything until I'm able to move as well."
1236,A,"I immediately got a second job, but due to some issues with the paperwork, my start date got pushed back."
1237,A,Paying for rent means I won't have money for groceries or anything else.
1238,E,"I'm extremely broke, still dealing with the break up, and struggling to catch back up in school."
1239,A,"My fridge is mostly condiments, and while I plan to go to a pantry tomorrow, a pizza would be nice to hold me over today."
1240,A,All major pizza chains are near me i.e.
1241,G,"Domino's, Pizza Hut, Papa John's."
1242,A,"Hey all, I am in my first apartment, pretty broke after paying my bills and I don't get paid until Wednesday."
1243,A,I need to save any money I have for gas money to get to work tomorrow and Wednesday.
1244,B,Would be totally awesome if someone could buy me a pizza.
1245,E,"I don't have any special story for you, I'm just a broke hungry dude."
1246,A,"On a side note, I have a gluten allergy and there is a Domino's and Pizza Hut within a mile of my apartment that both offer gluten free pizzas."
1247,B,"I'm not expecting results, but would be very greatful if I received one."
1248,B,Thank you.
1249,G,I'll try to keep the sob story minimal.
1250,A,My lady of 5 years is pregnant (about 8 weeks?
1251,A,Something like that) and I'm out of work due to a back injury.
1252,A,"We recently had the transmission blow up in the car we owned, but we were lucky enough to have a family member gracious enough to loan us a vehicle."
1253,A,Problem is this vehicle is a MASSIVE SUV and between her job and both of our doctors appointments the gas is sucking us dry.
1254,D,"So between the insatiable bottomless pits that are my fuel tank and my girlfriend's appetite (sorry baby) I've been struggling lately, so a pizza would both fill our tummies and take a little weight off my shoulders for a day."
1255,C,"In return I can offer your choice of a picture of our happy future family enjoying said pizza, or a shitty poem written by yours truly!"
1256,B,Hello RAOP!
1257,A,Im currently studying and I have 3 papers to still write tonight.
1258,A,I havent had time between a project and all of these works to eat (it has been over a day and a half since I have eaten).
1259,B,I was hoping that someone would be able to provide me with pizza??
1260,A,"The nearest store is a Dominoes, Or a pizza hut."
1261,A,"I live In De Pere, Wisconsin."
1262,A,"Not sure what else to put... 

&amp;#x200B;

Since I have no money for the near future to give back to the community, I can offer the person who provides a pizza, some dank memes or a really corny joke"
1263,A,"Context: my girlfriend and I have been sitting pretty living in London for the last six months, both with solid jobs and a fair amount of disposable income."
1264,A,"She recently received an out of the blue offer for a PhD in another town a good distance away, but it meant that we only have a month to find a new place there and new jobs."
1265,A,"Because of the sheer speed of all this happening we have both been absolutely teetering on the edge of breakdowns, we found out that we don't fall into the affordability brackets of any of the places we were looking at and the offer on the place we had fell through."
1266,A,Now we are both unemployed as we thought we would have moved out by now and we are tired of potatoes.
1267,B,Help us please.
1268,A,All of our combined money now has to go towards ridiculous estate agents fees we'll have to pay in the next couple of weeks...if we find a place to live.
1269,A,It's coming apart at the seams.
1270,A,Posting here in hopes of pizza.
1271,G,Bit of a story!
1272,A,Husband works CONSTANTLY to support us.
1273,A,right now I'm 23 weeks pregnant (see r/babybumps) and after moving back into our apartment due to MIL troubles we're broke til next payday.
1274,A,It's my fault that we're broke which is why I'm secretly posting here while husband is at work and cannot see it.
1275,A,Insurance refuses to cover my prenatal now for some reason so our spare food/gas money has gone to those.
1276,E,"I am out of work sadly (was collecting SSI for my disability but they cut it off as soon as I got pregnant and no one wants to hire a pregnant woman even for a temp :(  )

So just hoping for a meal for when husband comes home from work :("
1277,B,Hey guys.
1278,A,So it's Friday night and I'm doing work/preparing for finals next week.
1279,A,It's a long night of work ahead of me...(weekend as well).
1280,D,I'm running low on funds (the heat bill this winter was been ridiculous) and a girl would love a nice old cheese pizza to feed me for the next day or so.
1281,A,There's a rumbly in my tumbly; it would make all this coding more bearable!
1282,B,Apparently the odds are slim but I would truly appreciate if someone would help me out.
1283,B,"If not, peace, love...and enjoy your weekend!"
1284,A,I'm an actuarial student.
1285,A,I started studying in November for one of my last major exams (Life Finance and Valuation).
1286,A,The exam is 5 hours and very intense.
1287,A,Results came out Friday and I failed.
1288,A,"This exam is only offered twice each year, so I won't be able to make another attempt until November."
1289,E,Very frustrating.
1290,B,**Pizza received: Thanks to Punderstruck for sending a pepperoni pizza and chicken wings from Domino's Pizza.
1291,E,We have had a really rough week.
1292,E,The stress and expense has wiped us all out emotionally and financially.
1293,A,I would be so happy if we could enjoy the last day of the weekend together.
1294,A,We are to broke to go out or order in.
1295,D,"We can't celebrate Saint Paddy's Day, and I want to bring a smile to everyone's face."
1296,B,Can you help us with some pizza?
1297,A,"PS I know I don't have a lot of activity, I usually just read everything and don't post, but I have been a long time lurker on Reddit."
1298,A,I just took a year sober on the fourth.
1299,A,"Frankly, I don't feel like my life changed all that much lately, as I'm still broke and hungry, which is why I'm here."
1300,A,"Looking at the big picture, there were lots of unexpected changes this year, but I slayed then all sans booze."
1301,A,"I do, however, deserve to celebrate a bit though, right?"
1302,A,Food's finest nowadays.
1303,A,"We just have Domino's, so if anyone wants to buy me dinner, I'd appreciate it."
1304,B,"Thanks, y'all."

1306,A,"I had that bike since I was in fifth grade, and rode it to school every day, now I am twenty and still rode it to work."
1307,A,"I bought a new bike and thought it should be safe inside the apartment, which it was."
1308,A,"The issue is when I went to bookman's and locked the bike out front, I came back and the bike and lock were gone."
1309,A,"The security guard proceeded to show me that the bike rack had been broken, and some one was able to pull the bottom up out of the ground by loosening the bolts, apparently this was how they had stolen a few bikes the past couple weeks."
1310,B,"Thanks for the heads up bookman's; I did their job for them and added a personal note on the faulty bike rack, warning other bikers, hopefully preventing any more theft."
1311,D,"Just really losing my faith in man kind's good nature, a slice would bring it back into perspective I think."
1312,A,Poor guy hasn't been able to shower taking care of our son who just started crawling like a maniac!
1313,A,I'm in Oregon and he's in Washington.
1314,A,He transferred the last of his money to me since I had to pay for my trip out of pocket with a reimbursement program.
1315,A,He's pizza-obsessed!
1316,A,"I would love to order it for him, but his transfer won't go through til Monday so were both lacking, he deserves it more though."
1317,G,I will try and attach a photo of my crazy kid as well for good measure!!!

1321,A,"Meanwhile, I'm looking for work and school just restarted."
1322,A,Finding work around my classes hasn't been easy.
1323,A,Most are waiter jobs and all want to speak with my previous employer.
1324,D,Its a rainy Sunday here in the DC area and a good meal would do a lot for raising my spirits.
1325,B,Thanks.
1326,B,Hello all.
1327,A,I am not the type to ask for handouts but I am out of options.
1328,A,My father just had bladder removal surgery last week and we are recovering in hospital provided housing.
1329,F,However we won't have any money and have no food until monday/tuesday next week.
1330,B,Does anyone think they could send us a pizza.
1331,C,I would be happy to repay you once I get some cash next week.
1332,B,Thank you
1333,A,My student finance has been delayed *yet* again but I'm told it will be by Friday.
1334,A,I have a formative assessment tomorrow and it would be a nice distraction whilst studying.
1335,A,"I have been living on 22p Aldi noodles, bread, soup and tinned sardines for about 3 weeks (it's rich in omega 3 and cheap!)."
1336,A,"Full disclosure I was given £25 on /r/Assistance about a month ago, and I've been stretching that out on my (world's most boring diet) since then (I also plan to pay those donors back, and yourselves if accepted)."
1337,A,"I like any toppings or any place, Dominos delivers to me but ANY 'town' place would be greatly appreciated!"
1338,A,I got *so* excited last night thinking of the food I could eat (not being reckless) only to be told it's delayed again and noodles again!
1339,A,"They aren't too bad if I add garlic granules and chilli powder, but, still..."
1340,A,Hey ya'll I'll just be honest.
1341,E,My fiancé and I are both mentally disabled and have really bad families so money and work has been difficult.
1342,A,Recently I got a great looking job at a local bakery and seemed to be going good until yesterday they unexpectedly fired me.
1343,A,They decided that they didn't want to train me up to the position and I just about scrapped our rent from what I made.
1344,F,We're currently both out of food stamps and our cupboard is nearly empty with even none of our usual hard time staples around.
1345,D,We just gotta get through one more day till one of us gets more food stamps so a pizza would help tremendously.
1346,A,"We live in Olympia, Washington and our best option for delivery is Dominos &lt;3"
1347,A,Food stamps are now 2 weeks late due to moving counties and a new case worker that is slow as molasses in January.
1348,A,"She's had my completed file for 2 full weeks (as of Friday) and still hasn't ""processed"" it."
1349,A,"(Whatever that entails..) 

My family (Me, Hubby, and 2yr old baby girl) have been living off our pantry and freezer for 2+ weeks."
1350,A,Last night we used our last chicken breast.
1351,A,Today was literally buttered rice.
1352,A,"The food stamp office is closed till Monday morning at which point I will be calling my case worker, her supervisor, as well as her supervisor's supervisor; hourly, if necessary, until I have money to buy food for my family."
1353,B,Until then anyone wanna send us a pizza?
1354,A,I have been looking for a job for about 3 months now and FINALLY!
1355,A,got the tap from the local UPS depot for a drivers job!
1356,A,Not the most glamorous job i know but hey for this area the money is decent and the station is close to home so no complaints from me!
1357,C,Paying it forward it specifically implied upon first full paycheck.
1358,A,Also if i get the job i promise not to be one of those jerk delivery guys that punts your nice box of Newegg goodness to the front door of your place from out by the curb!
1359,B,":D

Any fine human being out there feel inclined to send out a good luck pizza to a prospective package jockey?"
1360,A,Now that i think of it that didn't sound so good..
1361,A,I'm a student running off of my loans currently.
1362,A,My car battery died last week and I had to purchase a new one which took all of my excess money.
1363,A,Currently worried about my bills and food for the next few months until I get my next check in late January.
1364,A,I'm trying to figure out what to do to get some money.
1365,A,My parents said they could help me out some but not until next week.
1366,B,Could somebody throw me a bone tonight?
1367,B,Thanks &lt;3.
1368,E,It's been a really really tight year money-wise as expenses have piled up.
1369,A,Had a bunch of expenses happen in June and then celebrated my daughter's 8th birthday last week.
1370,A,My 5 year old son just asked for pizza tonight...
1371,A,I have $13 in my account which is enough to maybe get a cheap pizza from Little Cesars but then it puts me in the scary situation of not having even a tiny bit of padding money in case some charge happens to my account from some random bill.
1372,A,Things always end up happening in spurts of months when it comes to things like that so I'm a bit paranoid.
1373,B,"It'd be create if someone could help us out with that, my family and I would be appreciative, so very appreciative."
1374,A,"We live in Oregon, USA and Dominos/Pizza Hut are really the only close places around here."
1375,A,"Girlfriend's out of town for the weekend, but even if she were here her car's busted, and we're both broke."
1376,E,"So i'm just sitting here on Reddit, depressed and hungry."
1377,A,Pizza places don't open for a little bit here but if someone could help me out with a pie and a 2 liter you'd be my hero.
1378,A,Edit: I'm an idiot and totally spaced on the location.
1379,G,Oh well.
1380,A,"If anyone sees this and wants to take pity, i'm in Tempe AZ."
1381,G,I'd edit the title but dunno how.

1383,A,"I've got an additional loan coming in a few weeks, but in the mean time, I would REALLY like to eat something that once walked the earth."
1384,A,"I live in a community house, and we share food expenses, but it's all vegan and my housemates are terrible cooks."
1385,C,"I'm more than happy to trade a knitted hat, or maybe some [paper quilling](  ) for a pizza!"
1386,A,"Papa John's has a good deal today, because the Timberwolves won last night."
1387,B,Thanks!
1388,B,"EDIT: Delicious pizza, THANK YOU!!"
1389,B,Hi random people.

1399,G,";)

Donors, if you're looking to help someone in need, look elsewhere."
1400,A,"Although I'd like a pizza, I really don't *need* one, and there's plenty of requests on here that really do."
1401,A,"That being said, if you're still up for helping me be the coolest brother of the day, I live in Naperville, IL."
1402,B,Thanks!
1403,A,I have less than 2 dollars in each of my accounts right now.
1404,A,The government of Kentucky takes out more money from me during the summer from my small stipend because I am not taking classes.
1405,A,I still have to do my research/work.
1406,A,I do not want to ask my parents for money as I'm 25 and I hate doing that.
1407,A,I just saved some money on my car insurance but that doesn't come into effect until next month.
1408,A,I'm barely getting by and have had about a coffee and a granola bar today.
1409,B,Please someone save me!
1410,A,Here in Austin after just dropping my fiance off at the strip club so she can go to work to keep a roof over our heads.
1411,E,"Yep, we're that desperate."
1412,A,I just lost the job of my dreams two weeks ago.
1413,A,"I had the funny realization that the new guy I was training was my replacement, I was right."
1414,D,"Anyway We're down to our 30 dollars left in our emergency supply that we need to save, the fridge is totally empty, I havent eaten an actual meal in days, any kind person who wants to brighten our day would be encouraged to help us out."
1415,A,We might not have a home by next month so I'm really hoping there's someone out there that will make me smile today.
1416,A,what my bank account currently looks like.
1417,B,"I am new at this, but my friends have done this, and helped out many."
1418,C,"I now have a job to start repaying the favors to people in need, cause I do believe in the golden."
1419,A,"Heard the RAOP has kinda become disappointing over the time, with people not repaying the favor, or doing what people request, or even just thanking people."

1850,A,The nearest pizza place that delivers is Dominos (I'm in Long Island).

1857,A,I have requested pizza on this site before and have recieved a gift card.
1858,A,But at the time I couldn't use it so I donated it to someone else who needed it more than I did (not unlike the Caped Crusader would have done).
1859,B,I would be grateful for any help.
1860,A,"Hello my name is James,I'm a 27 yr old male in California in DIRE need of some food/pizza..."
1861,A,I lived in a house shared with a buddy and 2 couples until recently.
1862,A,"At approximately 4:00 am earlier this month, completely unprovoked,I was attacked with a bat by one of my male roommates (He apparently became convinced his wife had feelings for me,which was completely false) I awoke just in time to cover my face as the bat was swung down on my head,and after several more blows,escaped with my life and clothes on my head.I was taken overnight to the hospital,my attacker taken into custody....upon release I was told to never come back to my home again,as my remaining roommates,having been friends for 2 decades,ultimately decided I was to blame for my attacker being detained,not caring for my well being,or the fact that I paid rent (I would have just stayed anyway for this month anyway,but was threatened with my life if I tried)


So now,having no family around and little to no friends to help (he decided to take the bat to my phone as well) I'm now out on the streets...I have no food,no money,and nowhere to go at night to sleep or even get out of the cold...I also lost with my home my means of Transportation,save a barely-functioning bicycle."
1863,A,"This is the whole story about what happened,without bias...its with a tremendous amount of sadness,and an unspeakable loss of pride that I write this,I have earned everything I have my whole life...If anyone has a trailer or Camper not in use,or willing to rent out Im willing to work for it.I am a medical CNA and am able-bodied...I am in need of clothes,shoes,Backpack,nearly anything sadly as all my possessions were gone through and taken...any gift cards or credit to obtain any food/clothes etc would be more than appreciated...I'm trying to stay positive, I later found out my roommate who attacked me has done this before,once nearly killing someone by stabbing them 8 times!"
1864,A,"But Im not a vengeful man,I forgive him,he's obviously a sick individual..."
1865,A,"I'm getting involved with the Victims of Violent Crime program, but seeing as he is still in jail and yet to be seen formally by a judge,that will take time...I can show whomever his charges however to corroborate my story if need be...I greatly appreciate both the time spent reading this and any help/advice given, thank you"
1866,A,Just heard about this and rather than request a pizza for myself I thought how fun would it be for a surprise pizza to show up for the Adoption and Lifesaving staff at the animal control shelter I volunteer with several times a week.
1867,A,"Its a rainy and miserable day, the shelter is extremely overcrowded meaning the days are stressful and filled with tough decisions being made for space."
1868,A,I wouldnt want them to know its from my request but just a random act of Pizza sent there way for all their hard work.
1869,A,The staff are there until 8pm Eastern time.
1870,A,Im actually headed over to walk some dogs this evening and would love to see them enjoying a surprise pizza :)    Even if we cant make it happen tonight..maybe another night/afternoon this week.
1871,A,Pizza can always make a bad day a little better!
1872,A,I'm a student in the UK who has been struggling financially for the past few weeks.

1875,A,Until then I'll be stuck with pot noodles  for 80% of my meals.
1876,A,"I know this is your typical ""broke student"" post but the struggle is honestly real and that's why I promise to pay it forward to another student whose going through the same problems, once I'm financially stable myself."

1878,B,Hello everyone!

1880,A,While i do have a job its been part time due to minimum wage going up so ive only been getting 2-3 shifts a week at 4-6 hours each.
1881,A,im looking at getting a different job and also considering going back to school to help get myself out of this slump.
1882,A,Pizza would be amazing tonight and if someone helps us out i can see about paying it forward after i pay my rent and get groceries!
1883,A,Ty for taking the time to read!
1884,A,"College student and I've lived mostly off of rice, oatmeal and a starbucks gift card I found in my apartment for the past 2 days."
1885,A,I could really use something more substantial but true to undergraduate form I'm out of cash right now.
1886,A,A delicious meat and veggie topped pizza would really hit the spot.
1887,A,If I'm honest I could bum some sandwich money off a roommate and overall I'm hardly in dire straits but I'm sick of hitting my friends up for minor things.
1888,A,Just a college student with a stomach that's as empty as his wallet.
1889,A,I'd love a pizza to study with tonight and to eat cold for breakfast tomorrow morning.

1892,A,I have two long papers to write for class and I'm pretty much running on empty and can't concentrate.
1893,A,What's a girl gotta do to get some pizza =\.
1894,A,"This post honestly makes me feel so pathetic, took a lot of courage to finally post it, not a fan of asking for help."
1895,A,"It would really help if someone could send me an egift card or something, then when im back on my feet ill payt forward as much as i can."
1896,F,"I'm dealing with some severe depression, caused by mental illness and right now all my money is being thrown at my doctors to help me get through this."
1897,A,"I have little food in my home, all of which needs to last me until the 8th when I can go grocery shopping again."
1898,A,"I'm feeding myself, so I don't need a lot, really anything will help."

1920,A,I'm going to be completely honest here about my stupidity.
1921,A,I went to the store today and spent my last bit of money buying some alcohol and didnt even think about the fact that I have no food.
1922,A,"Now I am at home, and have no money and no food in my house."

1929,A,"I would rather not go into why I had a bad day because it might seem stupid to a lot of you.. but for me, I am struggling just to pull myself out of bed... (oh, I can help design a website as well if anyone would be interested in that.. or a mobile app for something) This isn't a sob story either.."
1930,A,"I don't ""need"" the pizza.. when my roommate gets home in the morning I can ask him to bring me somewhere.."
1931,A,"I just can't afford it myself (again, trying to change that.. but I am in a really bad spot in life right now.. so it's hard.. but I am keeping a positive attitude about it.. or trying to at least)"
1932,A,No sob story here.

1951,A,"But, due to circumstances with them, we've been in really tight money for about three years now."
1952,A,"And we've been getting by food wise on food banks, and some meat (mostly chicken) on payday."
1953,A,"It's looking up recently, but that doesn't change the fact that I haven't had any sort of pizza in a little over three years."

1965,A,I can pick it up so delivery fee will need to be paid.
1966,A,She's really hungry and just hasn't been feeling so well but she's kicking ass at being an amazing wife and student and would love to satisfy her pregnancy cravings with some pizza if anyone is willing to help a fella out.

2659,A,"Hey fellow Redditors, I've been having an exceptionally tough week as my weeks end on Thursdays."
2660,A,I've been living pay check to paycheck and had some bad luck fall my way in regards to my vehicle unfortunately using up all the money I had stashed away for a rainy day as well as having to max out my credit card to get it repaired.
2661,A,If that wasn't bad enough my boss decided he needed to make an example of me a wrote me up for being late from picking up my vehicle this morning even though he knew I was having it worked on.
2662,A,"Due to me being 30 minutes late he made me work through my lunch break in which my friend was going to buy me lunch, so I haven't had a chance to eat all day."
2663,B,Thanks for listening!
2664,A,"I'm in North Carolina, if that matters."
2665,A,"I don't know how the timing works with making a post/having a request fulfilled, but I would be planning to have the pizza tomorrow, not today."
2666,A,My wife is leaving first thing in the morning for a business trip and I'll be fending for myself for meals the next couple of days.
2667,A,"My wife has Celiac's Disease, so we don't keep bread or ""real pizza"" in the house for solidarity."
2668,A,"I was hoping to enjoy a Dominoes pizza for myself, but I'm cutting it close this month on bills due to Christmas presents and student loans so it just wouldn't be a smart financial decision to splurge."
2669,A,"I know this doesn't entitle me to anything, but I would certainly appreciate it if someone was looking to fulfill a request anyway."
2670,A,My son knows about Reddit and would really freak if someone sent one for him and his bros.(his words lol).
2671,A,Make some kids day?
2672,B,Thanks for reading and have a good one!
2673,A,"I have 3 boys(12,13) over this afternoon for a day of gaming."

2675,A,"All I have for munchies is tunafish,popcorn and kool-aid."
2676,A,You know how kids love pizza if some one could send a pizza their way I know they would flip.
2677,A,Getting a real dinner tonight would REALLY brighten my spirits a lot.
2678,A,Bonus points if you play DotA and wanna get on with me after the game or something.
2679,A,I don't really have any plans because I don't really know anyone yet.
2680,B,Hey guys.
2681,A,I just moved across the country and it took me longer to find work than I thought it would.
2682,A,I haven't gotten paid in like three weeks and I am officially broke.

2694,A,Recently I've decided to focus on all the good that's waiting for me in life.
2695,A,"I faced homelessness, like many on here I used my last dollars to feed my cats instead of myself, and almost had to give up on all of my dreams."
2696,A,"Luckily (maybe a week before I had to be out of my apartment) I found a steady job, and shortly after ended up scheduling my entire next year for my second job."
2697,A,"I consider myself very lucky, extremely lucky, and though I'm beginning to get back on my feet I am still not able to feed myself properly."
2698,B,Thanks!
2699,A,We are in California btw.
2700,A,Pizza Hut is closest.
2701,A,So we are pretty low on money and I wasn't able to get him a present yet so I feel pretty bad about that.
2702,A,He also just lost his job 2 days ago.
2703,D,If I could surprise him with a pizza for dinner it would make his day!
2704,C,I will absolutely pay it forward in a few weeks when I get my money.
2705,A,"I'm stuck with rice and canned veggies right now, and both of those are starting to run low."
2706,A,I would not be opposed to a trade off deal where I get you back next weekend.
2707,A,"Dominos, Howie's, Hut, Papa's, Figaro's and Marco's are all major chains nearby."
2708,A,"I posted last year asking because my job didn't give me enough hours, that actually continued until about a month ago when I got fired."
2709,A,"Now, I'm broke but have a new job."
2710,A,"I get paid on the 28th, but most of that is going to rent and bills."
2711,A,I would just like to have a really delicious taste of the pie.
2712,A,":-)

My guidelines are...

    nothing illegal (not looking for jailtime...)

    nothing NSFW (not looking for jailbait...)

    nothing unreasonable (imma not cloning teh Googelz for just a pizza...)

Feel free to pm with your projects, and we can go from there."
2713,B,Thanks everyone.
2714,G,Nom
2715,B,Hello all.
2716,A,I'm looking to barter digital work for pizza.
2717,A,"Since there is a Domino's in town, and since they have an eGift system in place, they are my preferred pizza source."
2718,G,":-)

This work could be along the lines of...

    MS Office stuff

    website stuff

    digital art stuff

    digital audio stuff

    digital video stuff

    programming / scripting stuff

    tech support stuff

Basically, computer-related stuff."
2719,A,I'm not one to beg but I get hungry just like everyone else.
2720,A,"Ive had enough bad luck lately, let's see if the PIZZAGODS will shine a ray of cheesy benevolence upon us."
2721,C,Will repay with offerings of a heavily decorated pizza box and our big saucy smiles.
2722,A,Insert sob story here: My girlfriend and I live together with (until recently) a roommate.
2723,A,"The day before rent was due our roommate split, packed everything she owned when we weren't home and left."
2724,A,She wasn't on the lease so we could either pay her rent or risk eviction.
2725,A,So we paid her rent and now we're broke till pay day and the fridge is empty.
2726,E,Im depressed and just would appreciate a little help.
2727,A,"Florida so papa johns, dominos, pizza hut, hungry howies."
2728,B,Thanks in advance
2729,A,We've had a tough year w me and the kids.
2730,A,Im working 2 jobs and barely surviving.
2731,A,Holidays are always hard.
2732,A,I try to make sure there is food for them and ive been averaging eating a meal every 2 days since my hours were cut a month ago.
2733,A,My 10 year old gets home a little later and would be ecstatic to have some food waiting for him too.
2734,C,No request is a problem!
2735,A,"A playlist, an illustration, an interesting edited photo, a custom request for a poem or love letter to give to someone, even NSFW requests are fair game &lt;3 worth a shot, right?"
2736,A,Do my little clan a favor and help us out with something to eat?
2737,A,My partner and I would really appreciate it.
2738,A,"We gathered up the absolute last of our change, down to the pennies, to get food this weekend."
2739,A,"We don't need much at ALL, but will happily make it up for anything you can contribute."
2740,A,really adds up.
2741,A,We're looking at an empty pantry and totally bummed.
2742,A,If someone could get us a pizza for tonight we'd be incredibly grateful.
2743,A,"My landlord double-leased the apartment we were staying in, resulting in them showing up last Thursday morning to kick us out."
2744,A,"We disputed and proved our lease wasn't until up until the 31st of August, but they did everything in their power to get us out early."
2745,A,"They're supposed to refund our unused rent and give us a little extra, but there's no telling when we'll see that check."
2746,F,"We've spent every dime we have moving into a new place; deposit, first and last month's rent, getting utilities turned on, etc."
2747,A,"I start a new job on Monday, but unfortunately I only had a very small paycheck to live off of, and its been gone for about a week now."
2748,A,"I don't need much, dominos or pizza hut is fine."
2749,A,This new job pays each week so I'll pay it forward asap.
2750,A,I've tried here a few other times to no avail.
2751,A,Someone suggested I give it another shot.
2752,A,We'll see.
2753,A,I recently had to quit my job without having time to line up another job.
2754,B,Happy days.
2755,A,Edit: I'm watching *The Godfather*.
2756,A,Pizza is a must.
2757,B,Hey friends.
2758,A,"I'm starving, I'd love a pepperoni pizza."
2759,A,There's a Domino's just down the road.
2760,C,"I'm paid on Monday, and I'll pay it forward."
2761,A,"So basically, long story short, I'm hoping I can get a pizza from an awesome person here and then get groceries probably Wednesday, when I have my paycheck."
2762,A,"Would really appreciate it, and I'm confident that any major chain is around here, but if it's up to me, I'd prefer dominos."
2763,A,"I'm not really in a position to be picky, though, right?"
2764,A,"Hey, I'll try to make this as not-sob-story as possible."
2765,A,"I moved to a new apartment a few months ago, but have since had some unexpected and large medical expenses and am now living on $7 for the next two days."
2766,A,"All I have in my apartment food-wise is rice, and while I could walk to the grocery store and probably eat some ramen for the next couple days... let's say I'm also not really wanting to go anywhere alone around here because of said things that caused the medical expenses."
2767,A,"That part I'm working on, but honestly I just am in no kind of mood to deal with catcalling as well."
2768,C,"As soon as I'm in a better way, I want to pay it forward."
2769,A,"So if anyone could be of help, would be incredibly grateful."
2770,B,Thank you!)
2771,A,"Hey Guys,

I'm not one to ask for charity."
2772,A,I'm just in a little bit of a pinch.
2773,A,I just recently started a new career and as such I've now been about 3 weeks without a paycheck.
2774,A,"With paying my rent and all my bills, I'm now down to about $8 to live off of until my first paycheck comes on friday."
2775,C,I'm hoping to pay it forward when I do find a job.
2776,A,"I'm in Minnesota,  have a coupon for Topper's (50% off) and would totally love that, but we have Papa Johns and Dominos (and several other chains) as well."
2777,B,Thanks!
2778,B,"Hello, kind pizza givers!"
2779,A,"I'm hoping to break up the monotony of vegan food cooked by people who don't know how to cook (don't worry, I know vegan food can be delicious!)"
2780,A,"with a pizza, but, unfortunately, I'm pretty strapped until I find work."
2781,B,"If anyone is willing to help out, I'd be super grateful!"
2782,A,My husband loves pizza and we could really use a pick me up.
2783,A,It's our 1st year wedding anniversary in a few days and we can't afford to celebrate.
2784,B,I'll gladly pay it forward when I'm more financially secure.
2785,A,"Hi reddit,

I am writing this because my husband and I have been going through a really rough patch."
2786,A,I have been out of work for a few months and my husband was just let go two weeks early from his seasonal job.
2787,A,We put in an application for food stamps on Friday but that is going to take a bit to get approved.
2788,A,I start a new job on the 8th so hopefully we will be ok after that.
2789,A,If someone could please send us an egift card that could feed 7 kids and 4 adults we would be very appreciative.
2790,B,Thank you all for what you do on this site and god bless.
2791,A,I know my son will be so happy for this.
2792,A,My son is having some friends over because he just got out of the hospital!
2793,A,"He had to have surgery on his arm after a fall and now he is doing better, although depressed because he has to wear a cast for the rest of the summer."
2794,A,"He is having a party to celebrate, but me and my husband don't have much money because we had to spend a lot for the surgery."
2795,B,(thank you obama).
2796,A,We would love something hot and cheesy to curve the mad munchies we have!!
2797,B,Thanks for reading.

2799,A,Just like the title says...
2800,A,I have a surgery consult finally tomorrow that is the first step in being able to walk after a fall on ice over two years ago.
2801,E,I am so crazy excited!!
2802,A,My fiance and I are staying at my parent's place to be closer to the doctor for the morning.
2803,C,I would even offer to write you a song if you bought me a pizza.
2804,A,"I may not be good, but it would be funny."
2805,A,come on!
2806,A,Title basically says it all.
2807,A,I am sitting on the couch of this new place trying to figure out what I want to eat and I realized that all I had was Ramen and rice.
2808,A,"I won't starve or anything without pizza, but god is Ramen and rice doing something to my stomach that is not good."
2809,A,Was hoping for a good hot meaty meal.
2810,A,I currently live with a roomate who is out of town until next week and he primarily eats out.
2811,A,Im sorry if this sounds like pandering but to be honest im out of reasonable options.
2812,B,Any kindness is much appreciated and i look forward to returning it in kind.
2813,A,"Im 26, have an ok job."
2814,A,But this month has been more financially taxing than anticipated.
2815,A,Yesterday I used my last bit of  bit of cash to buy tickets for my friends to go see the force awakens which at some point i will get reimbursed for.
2816,A,I dont get paid until friday and until then i dont have a means of eating a meal.
2817,A,"We are near Dominos, Pizza Hut, Little Ceasars, and others."
2818,B,Thanks.
2819,G,edited formatting.
2820,A,"*my dogs are super adorable, or I can draw you something, or both."
2821,A,"(be warned, I am not a great sketch artist but will try)*

Hi."
2822,A,"im not gonna try and gain sympathy with some long winded story, suffice it to say; things really suck at the moment, and a nice pizza would take some of suck away, and prevent my diabetic mother from eating ice cream for dinner because she has the dietary preferences and impulse control of a grieving and stressed out 4 year old."
2823,A,One pizza would feed the three of us.
2824,A,"The pizza would be for her, me, and my nana."
2825,C,When I get a job I'll return the favor.
2826,A,"Update: I have recieved a pizza from /u/alfadude  
Thanks for helping me out guys!"
2827,A,"I'm a broke teenager (15, can't get a job), and I want to do something special for her."
2828,A,"Her psychiatrist changed her doses due to side effects, and has been feeling more depressed than usual."
2829,E,"It makes me upset that I can't do anything, so maybe a pizza will cheer her up at least a little."
2830,A,"Papa Johns is her favorite, but there's also a Pizza Hut and a Dominos nearby."
2831,A,I'll dedicate my first pay-check to you guys and offer someone else in need a free pizza!
2832,B,"Please help me out, reddit!"
2833,B,=)
2834,A,I'm a 22 year old guy living in the outskirts of Seattle.
2835,A,I lost my job a couple months ago because of anxiety issues and have been barely making it by.
2836,E,I'm practically down to my last packet of ramen.
2837,A,"=(

I have an exciting job opportunity now, and if everything goes well, I should be starting next week!"
2838,A,"He got arrested and no one else, even his family, came to get him out."
2839,A,Cost me around $1000 to release him... Im dry with money now and could use a a pizza...
2840,C,I of course would pass along the generosity
2841,A,I just bailed a childhood friend out of jail today.
2842,A,"He had been getting mixed up in drugs, and honestly, I hadn't spoken to him in about a year."
2843,A,But I never stopped caring about him.
2844,A,"He got pulled over, and cops found a bag of weed."
2845,A,"I am a single mom of 3 kids, ages 6 months, 3 years, and 7 years."
2846,B,"I am throwing a small party this Saturday, Oct 29th and my daughter requested pizza for supper and I'm not sure I can afford pizza for all her guests (10 girls) I would appreciate any help offered!"
2847,G,Verification can be provided.
2848,B,Hi.
2849,A,My girlfriend told me about Reddit and random acts of pizza.
2850,A,I still can't believe there is people this generous out there.
2851,D,I need a hand with the food for my daughter's birthday party.
2852,A,I've been sharing my human food whith my dog so that he doesn't run out but now I'm out of food and haven't eaten since Tuesday morning.
2853,A,I can go untill Friday without food so please if someone in more need than I am is out there please help them.
2854,B,Thank you for taking your time to hear my story.
2855,A,"I recently broke up with my girlfriend, she took a vacation to go and fuck her ex in another state, Valentine's Day, and broke up with me when she got back a week later."
2856,A,then a few days after I find out through istagram... it's a long story but you get the gist.
2857,A,"Anyways I had to pay her what I owed her and I did, right away to get her out of my life, thinking that my tax checks would come by the end of the week."
2858,F,"It's 3 weeks later and they still haven't come and after paying what I had in rent and dog food, I've run out of money."
2859,A,In between paychecks so the pantry is empty and we can't afford a meal out this week!
2860,G,EDIT: Zip code is 85027!
2861,A,"We've got Dominos, Pizza Hut, and my personal favorite is a local Chicago style place called Barro's."
2862,A,Never posted here before (to my knowledge anyway).
2863,A,I kinda came across the sub on accident.
2864,A,It's really as simple as the title.
2865,D,Save from my wife lol.
2866,A,Or at least I hope so!
2867,A,Can we please try to work something out?
2868,B,Thank you in advance!
2869,A,My girlfriend and I are in a lot of pain and cannot physically cook.
2870,A,"We have a doctors appointment to get to in the morning, but we need to eat before we go."
2871,A,I am willing to barter!
2872,C,I have stuff in my eBay store that you would *love*.
2873,C,I will gladly pay this forward the very second I'm paid again.
2874,B,Thanks so much reddit!
2875,G,edit: I do have a verification number.
2876,A,"Hey guys,

I've heard good things about this subreddit, hopefully someone could help out with a pizza just until friday?"
2877,A,Recently moved and my first check was almost entirely spent getting the deposit covered for power and the last half of my move in cost.
2878,A,"I saw ""almost"" because I only have about $0.75 left until Friday."
2879,B,Would someone want to help a guy out with a pizza until the end of the week?
2880,A,"I was planning on getting a job for myself, but until then I'm pretty broke so yeah."
2881,A,"This will probably make things harder, but I live in eastern Europe."
2882,A,"In a city, but still."
2883,A,"Hi everyone,

My gf is a single child, with only her grandpa left (mom and mom's mom both dead, never met her father)."
2884,A,"We're both college students, and with the money she's getting she has just enough to pay rent and food at the cantina, fancy food is rarely an option, if ever."
2885,A,"I'm not in a great spot myself, my dad just lost his job and mom works in an elementary school so they can only send me just the bare mininum too."
2886,A,He should be able to find a new one but this is how it's going to be during this transitional period.
2887,A,"I'm also struggling so I cant treat myself, So this would be awesome!"
2888,B,Please?
2889,C,"I have helped out in a randomacts and babyexchange but not on this reddit yet,I do plan too :)

Thanks  :)"
2890,B,Hey there!
2891,A,I am so exhausted I've chased after a tot all day that is teething and refuses to listen to the word NO.
2892,A,am hungry and a warm pizza and breadsticks would just make my kiddos month.
2893,A,I'm a single working mommy and getting treated to dinner is not something I've gotten in over a year!
2894,A,There's a Dominos nearby.
2895,A,Anything helps.
2896,B,Thank you so much.
2897,A,I have been a human geyser for the last 24 hours.
2898,A,Until about 4pm today I could barely even keep water down.
2899,F,"I'm keeping saltine crackers and ramen broth down for now, but I feel super weak and I just want some real food in my system."
2900,A,I just paid rent and can't afford to eat anything but the ramen and peanut butter I already have.
2901,A,Domino's is the only chain nearby.
2902,G,US 33444.
2903,B,Thanks for your time.
2904,A,"This last month has been really rough, with a move and job change."
2905,A,"Almost through it but like im feeling now, the cabinets and fridge are feeling very empty."
2906,A,We both could use a recharge.
2907,A,I hate asking but i could really use the help.
2908,A,I need someone's help.
2909,C,I will gladly pay back whoever treats me tonight.
2910,B,Thank you in advance.
2911,A,My roommate and I landed a house that we planned on moving into at the end of May.
2912,A,"Well, her crappy ex-bf decided to be a dick about things and now she's gone and we had to sign the lease agreement for the house since she needed a place to put her stuff."
2913,A,"That left me in the hole since I was getting ready to save last week, but cant now since I have no money."
2914,A,A pizza would help the situation feel somewhat manageable.
2915,A,"I live in PA, USA."
2916,A,There is Domino's and Papa John's near me.
2917,B,Thanks.
2918,A,"Hello,

Due to an emergency earlier in the month I had to pay $1,200 for something."
2919,A,"This put me in a bad financial situation, I haven't revealed how bad it is to anyone because I'm embarrassed but I am all out of money as of now."
2920,A,"I get paid on the 18th, and I have some eggs and sausages in my fridge that I can stretch out until then, a large pizza would just make my life a lot easier right now."
2921,B,"I would really appreciate any help, and I promise to come back to this sub and back to people once I get my paycheck."
2922,A,And it would be shut by the time I went in again today....
2923,B,So could anyone possibly send me a pizza or like... any other food?
2924,A,I haven't eaten all day :(
2925,A,"So, I [wrote](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/lsqto/i_would_like_to_take_a_moment_to_rant_about/) a week or so ago about the problems I was having getting the student finance company to get my loan to me, and it still hasn't been resolved and I've reached the end of my overdraft (they'll only give me a £200 overdraft until my loan comes through)."
2926,A,I tried to go to my university to get some emergency funds and the lady I spoke to said I could only get a £50 bridging loan which seeing as I'd have to pay back in 4 weeks she didn't want to give me.
2927,A,"And after arguing with her for quite a while about how I needed the money to buy food she said that it didn't matter because the lady who could've given me the money left at 2pm (I went in at 1:30pm, she was just arguing with me for that long)."
2928,A,"I then went into my bank to try and get my overdraft extended and they told me I needed to do it over the phone, went home and called them up and apparently I needed to go back to my branch and do it."
2929,A,No delivery in my area so if anyone is kind enough to help a hangry gal out I'll just have to pick it up tomorrow when I have a ride.
2930,A,Only place in my tiny town is Pizza Hut.
2931,B,Thanks in advance for even considering me :)
2932,A,I'm honestly just hungry and very broke.
2933,A,I'm packing to move cross country and have 1 box of Mac and cheese and $.09 to my name until the 1st and a pizza will last me a few days.
2934,A,Trying to sell some things for a little cash but nothing has worked out so far.
2935,A,I'm currently on the east coast US.
2936,C,"I can make you a minecraft sprite of anime, pokemon, etc."
2937,A,[This](  ) is an example of what I can make.
2938,C,"I will try my best to make a cool one for anyone who'd be willing to gift me a pizza :) Closest pizza place is Pizza Hut in Girard, PA."
2939,B,Thank you for taking the time to read this post.
2940,F,I currently have no money until the first of next month.
2941,A,Would love a pizza.
2942,B,If someone would be kind enough to provide one that would be awesome.
2943,B,Thank you.
2944,A,edit: Just saw on the side bar it says to include location in the request.
2945,A,"I am in Dallas, TX."
2946,B,"Hello all, this is my first time using this sub so I hope I've done everything correctly."
2947,A,"My cat was recently diagnosed with chronic kidney disease (CKD/CRF) and diabetes, so the vet bills have been very high the last couple months with all the tests, treatment, and medicine."
2948,A,"Just took her in yesterday for a re-check to adjust her fluid treatment, but that leaves me with no money until I get paid on Saturday."
2949,A,"I've got enough food for 1 day, I'd be really grateful for a pizza sometime today or tomorrow to help get through these next couple days."
2950,A,I was evicted from my home this past monday..
2951,A,I spent all last week desperately searching for a place to live..
2952,A,"Since I'm disabled, and still waiting for my benefits to start, I knew I could never afford a place for myself.."
2953,A,So I did what most people in my situation would do..
2954,A,I had faith that between my family and all my friends..
2955,A,"SomeONE.. (I thought there would be many)  would find it in their heart to take me in, even if for just a short time..  After waiting a few days, I realized that no one was going to come to my aid.."
2956,A,So I decided to start asking those who I KNEW would do anything for me.. Or so I thought..
2957,A,Immediate family turned me away without even a 2nd thought..
2958,A,"My family is adjusting to a new normal, my fiancé and I are suddenly in a parental role, and the child is living with us now."
2959,A,Today was the first day at the new school.
2960,A,I'd love to have pizza on the table tonight.
2961,A,7 months ago my fiancé and I found out his little sibling was being sexually abused by their adult step brother.
2962,A,"The parents knew, according to the child, and did nothing."
2963,A,Fiancé and young sibling's Mom died towards the end of last year.
2964,A,We challenged the step dad for custody and have finally won.
2965,A,"The step-brother will hopefully be in jail soon, or at least on the sex offender registry."
2966,B,Please.
2967,A,Honestly any food would do.
2968,A,ZIP code 60660.
2969,A,I can walk.
2970,A,It's pretty dark out so please not trying to rush but if I were to walk and walk back it would probably be cerfew.
2971,A,Don't want to break any laws or anything.
2972,A,Please also I won't contact CPS or anything.
2973,A,I'm better off trust me.
2974,B,"Hello, I just heard of this site."
2975,A,"My family is going through some rough times right now, there are 4 of us, my father, my 2 sisters, and myself."
2976,A,My oldest sister and I are out of work.
2977,A,"My father was too, but he just found a job a week or so ago."
2978,A,"My sister and I have been looking for jobs for a while, but we only have one car at the moment, so it's hard to find an employer who is willing to work with someone else's schedule."
2979,A,"I have applied at all the places within walking distance to our house, but we live in a really small town, and all of our small-town businesses are suffering."
2980,A,"We've been spending the past week packing, because we are in the process of losing our house."
2981,A,"We do have food stamps, and they definitely help, but we're out until the end of this week and would really love a pizza."
2982,A,I've only had this happen once... and the last time I at least had yummy food to motivate me :(.
2983,A,"I'm a student who's very overwhelmed right now with... 4 exams in the next 3 days, a 10 page paper due in...16 ish hours, and god knows how many projects for my linguistics class my prof forgot to mention... and I got up about 5 minutes before the dining hall closed."
2984,A,I rarely am awake during the day so usually I have *something* to nosh on but apparently not tonight.
2985,A,Forgot to buy groceries and the fridge is empty save for a few week old peanut sauce packets from a falafel place.
2986,A,Speaking of- I'm gonna throw these out they smell terrible.
2987,A,If anyone could spot me for a pizza from Dominos that would really make my night.
2988,A,"Otherwise there's not much else open this late at night (11:30pm), everything generally closes up by 10 around here :/, have zero clue why."
2989,A,Ironically(?
2990,A,"And I just ate the last two eggs in my APT and now only have a can of chicken noodle soup,some potato wedges,minute rice and half a loaf of bread in my kitchen."
2991,A,I've been working my ass off for the past month but recently had to put 900 bucks into my car two weeks before my rent was due.
2992,A,After paying rent on the 1st I had 35 bucks to last me 10 days until pay day.
2993,A,"I am now down to 7 bucks and I work Tomorrow, Thursday and Friday."
2994,A,"I have just over qtr of a tank left and my work is 12 miles from my apt, so I'm pretty much spending that 7 bucks on gas in hopes that it will get me enough to get to work."
2995,A,"I have gotten pizzas on here before, and i've been lurking thru the threads this week trying to win a pizza but every time i'm to late."
2996,A,"I know that RAOP gets these type of sob stories all day, and a lot of them arent rewarded so i'm not really putting to much hope into this."
2997,A,I just thought it would be nice to try and get a large pizza that I could munch on for a few days so I dont starve before pay day.
2998,B,Hey all.
2999,A,"I live with my girlfriend's family (mom, dad, her)."
3000,A,Her mom's on disability and her dad is having extreme pain from his gall bladder.
3001,A,"He's saved as much as he can to hopefully get a surgery done in a few weeks, but we're in a tough spot right now."
3002,A,"Our propane tank is below 5%, his surgery is eating into our gas bill pretty heavily."
3003,E,"But now that the pain is too much for him (Farm laborer), we're going to be really hurting."
3004,A,A pie would do us good.
3005,A,"My girlfriend and I have been supporting as much as we can, but we both have crap part time jobs."
3006,A,"Hi there, my name is Paul and that title almost rhymed."
3007,E,"___

My family and I've had a month thus far that has been depressing and quite expensive."
3008,A,I'm not gonna go into too many details right now.
3009,A,"If you're really curious as to what's going on, there's a post in my history from a few days ago where I vented a bit about some of it."
3010,A,"Anyway, basically this month went very sour, rather quickly and now my family and I are broke until we get payed in 2 weeks."
3011,A,"Because of events personally effecting me, my sister wants to be kind and buy some pizza for when we all watch the WWE special events this weekend, Which is super sweet of her."
3012,A,"As I said, though, none of us currently have money."
3013,A,"So, she's talking about gathering up a bunch of stuff and selling it at a pawn shop to try to quickly get enough to do so."
3014,A,"Last night my best buddy, our pit bull mix, passed away."
3015,A,He was 12 and the best boy anyone could ask for.
3016,A,"Yesterday, he was acting normal in the morning then at noon I went to take him out and he wouldn't stand up."
3017,A,I finally got him up and he took a couple steps then fell over.
3018,A,"Took him to the vet, they said he had a stroke and his kidneys were failing."
3019,A,Took him home with pain meds.
3020,A,He passed laying on my bed while I cuddled him and told him how much I loved him.
3021,A,Needless to say this has been incredibly hard.
3022,A,There was a weird processing error with auto payment where my rent was taken out from my account twice.
3023,A,"Everyone is apologetic and it was just a shitty accident, but the refund is taking time to process."
3024,A,I'm a broke college student who can only work enough to live paycheck to paycheck while in school.
3025,F,I don't have any money until I get that refund.
3026,A,i have had basically nothing but ramen and potatoes for a few days now.
3027,A,Then I found this subreddit.
3028,A,"It might sound cheesey, but pizza has always been my go to comfort food."
3029,A,Pizza and coke.
3030,B,Hey guys!
3031,A,"I don't have a very compelling story for why we can't afford pizza, but we are on a budget and have been for a while."
3032,A,"We are at about half salary of what we used to be, and the house has been in poor spirits lately."
3033,A,"We have a week filled with Errands and doctors appointments, and a special dinner would do wonders :) 

In return, I can offer a derpy drawing of any pokemon you choose, or I could write you a short story about any topic :D  

Thank you so much in advance."
3034,A,"I live in Maryland, USA."
3035,A,"I have Papa Johns, Dominos, and Pizza hut all within delivery."
3036,A,"The house includes me, my husband, and my three-year-old."
3037,C,I hope to be able to contribute back to the subreddit more in the future!
3038,A,"I feel kinda selfish posting this, but I could use something to cheer me up."
3039,A,"I'm a student living alone in Bloomington, IN over the summer to work."
3040,A,The groceries I bought at the start of the summer are pretty much gone or too old.
3041,A,"I was going to buy more yesterday, but some bad luck struck."
3042,A,Turns out somebody hacked into my bank account and emptied it out.
3043,A,"The bank caught it while it was mostly still pending, and contacted me."
3044,A,"Because I had not authorized those purchases, they locked down my account and I got all but about $100 back."
3045,A,"I was going to go into the bank today to get it sorted out and maybe get my account unlocked so I could use checks or something, but the one branch close to me is apparently closed on Saturdays."
3046,A,"Long story short, today is my boyfriend's birthday and it has nooooot gone as planned at all."
3047,A,"It sucks :( I want to take him out for dinner to try to fix this, but can't afford it."
3048,A,Broke as hell and I don't get paid until the end of the month.
3049,A,"I live in Canada, is anyone willing/able to help me out?"
3050,A,Something delicious from Pizza 73 or Panago would go miles towards helping me perk him up and put a smile on his face.
3051,A,"Edit: scratch this request, guys."
3052,A,We're passing out now.
3053,A,Keep calm and pizza on!
3054,A,"Hi guys, I need some help."
3055,A,"School just let out last week, and as such summer break has started for most students."
3056,A,I however am working at the university over the summer full time.
3057,A,"""If you're working full time, why do you need help to eat, you should have money enough for food?"""
3058,A,I hear you ask.
3059,A,"Well, my fulltime schedule literally started today."
3060,A,I get paid monthly and the campus dining commons are closed this week for some dumb reason.
3061,A,"My latest check that was issued not three days ago is already almost gone due to paying bills, housing contracts, and other such necessities."
3062,A,HEY RANDOM ACTS OF PIZZA!
3063,A,I am writing to you from the mountains of North Carolina - Appalachian State to be specific.
3064,A,I am currently a graduate student in an analytics class.
3065,A,Now in this class we had to do a final project.
3066,A,My group and I decided to analyze you wonderful bastards to see if there was a method to the madness.
3067,A,"Basically we took over 4000 different posts, some got pizza, some didnt, and used every trick in our book to find out if it was random or if there was a certain type of post that had a high chance of getting a pizza."
3068,A,"Some 40+ Hours later, we have come to realize you guys are random as hell, and no one can predict your awesomeness."
3069,A,"That being said, we present our findings to our class tomorrow, didn't know if anyone wanted to show our class how awesome you guys are!"
3070,A,We usually do okay.
3071,A,"Truth be told, my birthday just passed and my fiance took us out."
3072,A,First birthday we could afford to celebrate in three years.
3073,A,"Only, we really couldn't."
3074,A,"I had no idea until after, and I can't blame him because he just wanted to give me an actual birthday."
3075,A,"We have a baby boy as well, and he just had the last package of ramen."
3076,A,It's been about 24 hours since I've eaten.
3077,A,We can't go another two days.
3078,A,Our life is literally so fucked up that we can't get any food.
3079,A,we were chastized and insulted for asking to get a ride to a food bank.
3080,A,"we (my boyfriend and I) are disabled, ill adults that have been trying to make ends meet in an abusive household that witholds money for food from us, and forcing me to drain my disability  getting delivery (we can not drive because of both illnesses and the absolute refusal to let us take the car to the store."
3081,A,there is nothing even within a bike ride to us.)
3082,A,every three days/week ( we try and make the food last as long as possible.
3083,A,and we go days without if we use it up too fast or someone in the house takes it.)

3085,A,I can't feed us.
3086,A,"Hello RaoP,


I don't usually beg for stuff, but I don't have anything to eat today."

3098,A,Needs had to come before wants and this is the first year I haven't managed to pull off something to make the holiday bright and special.
3099,A,There is no tree even but if there was it would only highlight the fact that there are zero presents under it.

3112,A,I'd be okay with eating ramen and bolognia but...
3113,A,I guess I just need a little comfort food maybe?
3114,E,I've been upset lately due to my grandpa being in the hospital and being off of depression meds (And away from my doctor) due to loosing my job and not being able to pay for them.

3143,A,I've heard great things about this subreddit and was hoping someone would help me out.
3144,A,"Had my hours cut at work, got paid last week only to spend it all by sunday catching up on bills."
3145,A,Had to pay for car insurance or else my license would have been suspended ( almost reached day 30)  because I wasn't made aware I lost my insurance ( parents always took care of it).
3146,A,And Now the car's engine won't even kick over.
3147,F,Stomach is growling and I have nothing but dry cereal ( which is something some people can't say I know. )
3148,A,So I'm hoping one of you kind people will help me fill my belly.

3166,B,Hello there!
3167,A,I believe in keeping things simple and to the point to display the best of honesty so here it goes...I'm broke!

3177,A,I've spent all day in bed feeling like shit instead of out applying at places.
3178,A,I only have 200 bucks in my account and I have no idea how long that'll have to last me.
3179,C,I'd be willing to repay the favor with my first paycheck.
3180,A,Because I live in a guest house Dominos is a must.
3181,A,"The pizza tracker tells me when to expect delivery and go to the main house, meaning I can wait in bed while it's cooking."
3182,A,"Today, at my local Pizza place, they have a deal on large pizzas-plain for $5.99 a pie and one topping for $7.99."
3183,A,I'm salivating just thinking about a bacon pizza.
3184,A,Or a meatball pizza!
3185,A,It is also game night at my house-I run an Age of Rebellion campaign every Tuesday.
3186,A,"So between the kids and the campaign, making dinner for myself gets tricky."
3187,A,Sometimes I don't eat a full meal and just graze on pretzels.
3188,A,"Any who, if you wouldn't mind being so kind and hooking me up with some grub, then I will make you your very own crappy beach art!"

3192,A,"To give you the short version:

I run a small computer repair business and I've been trying so hard to fix this guys laptop to no avail."
3193,A,"It will recognize a drive, but won't read it, no matter what I do."
3194,A,I've been working on it all day and I'm at a loss.
3195,A,"So to wind down from my stressful day, I wanted to watch Rogue One and order a pie, but I just looked at my bank account to see if I could afford one, and I have a lot less than I thought I did, so buying myself pizza is out of the question."
3196,A,"(I've actually had to throw some of my Fallout 4 Pip Boy Edition onto Craigslist today because of it)

My girlfriend has also been writing a paper all day for school and could also use a pie of cheesy deliciousness."

3214,A,This is a weird one.
3215,A,"I was diagnosed with Diverticulitis about three years ago, and haven't had any flare ups since, so I guess I got complacent."
3216,A,"I had a flare up about nine days ago (104 fever, omega-level stomach pain, etc)."
3217,A,"I spent three days in the hospital, two of which I was on only IV liquids."
3218,A,"I transitioned to a liquid diet and have been on Ensure, Slimfast, and the like for about seven days now."

I am in the midst of a Crohn's flare-up and utterly exhausted."
3255,A,My lovely wife works quite long hours to cover most of our bills - I am hoping to surprise her this evening with an easy dinner of delivery as it is something we almost never get to do; we get our groceries for the most part from the local food bank.
3256,A,Pizza would be a lovely break from boxed mashed potatoes and leftover donated Chipotle meat.
3257,A,We are in Denver and open to any major pizza chain.
3258,B,Thank you.
3259,G,Edit: a word.

3273,A,"[Pic of cat, named Thunder, with aforementioned son."
