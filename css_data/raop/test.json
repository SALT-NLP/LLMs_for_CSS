I was bummed but kind of expecting it (cutbacks and such) and was able to score a few temp jobs here and there to keep my bank account stable, and seeing as my SO still had a full time job, we weren't terribly worried about the situation as a whole. \n\nFast forward 2 weeks: my SO gets fired out of the blue by the new GM at the newsroom where he worked. He's been really down and has not yet been able to find a job. We had just signed our new lease so all of our money had gone to that and our bills. There is not much I can do for him at this point, seeing as I've only been working 2 or 3 days a week tops. \n\nNormally to cheer ourselves up we go all out on cheap pizza (Dominos, Hungry Howies, etc.), but with our lack of incoming funds, it's something that we haven't been able to do, and I think it would definitely lift his spirit a bit.

Been going through some rough times lately. My mother passed exactly a year ago this week (February 13th, 2011), due to colon cancer at the young age of 55, sadly I cannot make it to her grave today to tell her how much I miss her, but I'm not much for hanging around dead bodies anyway, the soul has moved on and I'm almost positive she's someplace nicer. Me and my father haven't been getting along either, he is an alcoholic, anger-ridden man.. Ana and I couldn't afford our last apartment so we tried moving in with him, to help him with bills and whatnot, and he constantly berated me. I'm not sure why he is the way he is, but I think it has something to do with his mother. When I was 12 I was a lot heavier than the other kids and she would tell me about it, in the meanest possible ways. So I'm pretty sure that's where he gets it from. Suffice it to say, living with him without my kind and compassionate mom to stop him from getting so angry was nothing short of terrible. Ana kept telling me how badly we needed to save up and get out of there, we were there for a week and then it got really bad when he found we took 2 plates of food up to our room. He started screaming and calling me names like always, telling us that we're no longer welcome, telling us to pack our bags and basically to live on the street... then I decided to be clever (sarcasm) and call him a \"dick\"  since he found it okay to call me every terrible name in the book, BAD move. I don't know how he heard me from the hallway, but he did. He slammed the door open, knocking over Ana's desktop computer, knocking over the desk it was set up on, and also knocking her over into our bed. He grabbed me by the throat and threw me up against the wall and started choking me out, much to Ana's dismay, she was crying and screaming at him the whole time, telling him to stop and let me go, trying to pull him off of me. Afterwards he offered us a ride to the shelter because we had her computer and all of our clothes.. we declined the offer. This was her idea. Then she gave me the best advice I have ever gotten concerning my father. Leave. Leave and never look back. He is not safe to be around. He is not a good person. So to say we've hit quite a rough patch is somewhat of an understatement. I'm not sure if this was all TMI but I really just feel a whole lot better getting it off of my chest. Ana is my hero, she really is, she is beautiful and she makes me feel like I'm actually worth caring about. If you've read this far, thank you so much.\n\nBut alas! Some good news! We both just landed new jobs yesterday. We both got hired as sales people at Sears... I know not much, but for around here it's pretty much the best we can find. I'm an IT guy, actually I'm more of a helpdesk-break\/fix-troubleshooter sort of guy but I also have worked IT jobs. We do what we can to be happy and this area doesn't have many jobs so we're trying our best. We don't have a car (in a town where the buses don't even run on sunday or after 5pm any day, no joke- [www.lctabus.com\/](www.lctabus.com\/)) and we spent every last penny on rent. In fact, we still haven't paid our security deposit, luckily the landlord is a good lady and is understanding of our situation. So clearly there is no money for pizza. Which is upsetting, since pizza just so happens to be our favorite food, hands down. If someone can be help, we'll be sure to share it with our little puppy Horatio, who is the most adorable dog in the world,  he just turned 3 on valentines day! Here's a picture of me and him: ([Horatio and Bill](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ohDJi.jpg)) , and for good measure here is a picture of my girlfriend\/his mommy: ([Ana](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/qHmZL.jpg)) .

We're not pigs - we can easily make a pizza last for two dinners between the two of us.  It would get us that much closer to my next paycheck without starving.\n\nWe would really, really appreciate a pizza from some kind Redditor right about now.  I can provide verification if needed.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nLocation: Northern NJ","7493":"I'd walk to the store, but I only have $9 until next month. I can walk to Domino's, so carry out with no delivery fee is a great option. I can give pictures of my cat in return. She's the cutest ever. \u2764\ufe0f","15520":"No sob story, actually a happy one. After 9 months of being unemployed and working horrible part time jobs, I finally started back working in my line of field and getting my life back on track.  Was going to order a pizza but just switched over all my money from one bank to another and my cash is being transferred!  Just wondering if anyone would want to help me celebrate by sending me a pizza? ","8999":"Hey all,\n\nRan into a bit of a rut and I'm currently sitting at -$198.08 in my bank account. (I can prove this if need be.)\n\nCalled my bank to figure out what was going on and apparently someone got my info and started running up a huge tab.\n\nSo while I work on this issue, I'm unable to purchase food. Would really love some assistance today if someone would be so kind. I'll definitely look to pay it forward in the future once my money situations are solved.\n\nDominos is close by to me, if that helps.\n\nThanks for reading.","14105":"Just found out that even though I'm broke as hell, my new insurance will cover my teeth extractions and new dentures. I've needed 'em for several years. So happy! I think I'll even be able to get my retina fixed so I won't lose sight in my left eye. I'm ready to party!","1227":"She has been running around all day panicking about school and work. She went up to campus twice to figure out financial aid stuff that the school mixed up, her hours just got cut back...AGAIN. We are looking to move out together soon, and with all of this going on I don't know how we're going to make that work and she's absolutely freaking out...and she gets grumpy when she's hungry. I just wish I could do something nice like get her a pizza but I don't have the money right now. Can anyone help?\n\nP.S. I get a check on the 15th so I can pay you back or send you a pizza then!!","7308":"First off, I\u2019ve gotten plenty of help from Reddit already so don\u2019t think I will starve without getting a pizza. I just want to conserve effort right now and also have a tasty dang pizza.\n\nI have my first conference for my impending divorce tomorrow. If you want the horrifying backstory I don\u2019t mind if people look through my post history. Compared with everything else I have survived at his hands, I can just throw potatoes and chicken in my slow cooker again and be happy I\u2019m alive. **But** a pizza with as much pepperoni dumped on it as allowed by law would feed me for the rest of the week and free up a lot of energy I can apply towards the horror show I got going on here. I haven\u2019t had a pizza in months and food tastes incredible since they took him away, like cheap hot dogs are an experience now, so I have the feeling pepperoni is going to knock my socks off. I used to love pepperoni.\n\nI wish I could promise you that a Papa John\u2019s or Pizza Hut would actually get to me, but there\u2019s something about sales territories and having to sacrifice an aurochs to Poseidon. Domino\u2019s, however... my campground swears by it because of their delivery.\n\nAny pizza accessories are also appreciated. I\u2019m down for whatever. It\u2019s a new world and my jeans have too much room in them.\n\nA food tip just for reading this: if you\u2019re ever near Red Rocks in Colorado, pregame at Bob\u2019s Atomic Burgers in Golden. They don\u2019t have a liquor license: for Red Rocks you have to pregame with protein (so you can drink more later). Don\u2019t worry that the line is out the door, they move fast and it\u2019s worth it. If you ever want to look like a genius to all your friends while you\u2019re going to a concert here, take them to Bob\u2019s.","3950":"Just realized that in the hussle this morning I totally forgot my lunch on the counter. Anyone able to help out? I'll make sure to pay it forward on wednesday after my check clears the bank.
