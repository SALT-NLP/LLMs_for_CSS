    "113": "Hey y'all. First post so hoping for the best. Here's the rundown...\n\nI lost my job about a month and a half ago right before my SO's birthday. I was bummed but kind of expecting it (cutbacks and such) and was able to score a few temp jobs here and there to keep my bank account stable, and seeing as my SO still had a full time job, we weren't terribly worried about the situation as a whole. \n\nFast forward 2 weeks: my SO gets fired out of the blue by the new GM at the newsroom where he worked. He's been really down and has not yet been able to find a job. We had just signed our new lease so all of our money had gone to that and our bills. There is not much I can do for him at this point, seeing as I've only been working 2 or 3 days a week tops. \n\nNormally to cheer ourselves up we go all out on cheap pizza (Dominos, Hungry Howies, etc.), but with our lack of incoming funds, it's something that we haven't been able to do, and I think it would definitely lift his spirit a bit. If any of you wonderful redditors could help, I would be super appreciative. I don't have much of anything to barter with, but I am willing to send you a few pieces of record art that I have made if you would like something in return. \n\nI know this whole thing probably sounds silly, but I need help getting him out of this funk and figure this is a great way to do it.

    "152": "Hey reddit, longtime redditor here.. lurked for a few years then signed up about a year ago. Been going through some rough times lately. My mother passed exactly a year ago this week (February 13th, 2011), due to colon cancer at the young age of 55, sadly I cannot make it to her grave today to tell her how much I miss her, but I'm not much for hanging around dead bodies anyway, the soul has moved on and I'm almost positive she's someplace nicer. Me and my father haven't been getting along either, he is an alcoholic, anger-ridden man.. Ana and I couldn't afford our last apartment so we tried moving in with him, to help him with bills and whatnot, and he constantly berated me. I'm not sure why he is the way he is, but I think it has something to do with his mother. When I was 12 I was a lot heavier than the other kids and she would tell me about it, in the meanest possible ways. So I'm pretty sure that's where he gets it from. Suffice it to say, living with him without my kind and compassionate mom to stop him from getting so angry was nothing short of terrible. Ana kept telling me how badly we needed to save up and get out of there, we were there for a week and then it got really bad when he found we took 2 plates of food up to our room. He started screaming and calling me names like always, telling us that we're no longer welcome, telling us to pack our bags and basically to live on the street... then I decided to be clever (sarcasm) and call him a \"dick\"  since he found it okay to call me every terrible name in the book, BAD move. I don't know how he heard me from the hallway, but he did. He slammed the door open, knocking over Ana's desktop computer, knocking over the desk it was set up on, and also knocking her over into our bed. He grabbed me by the throat and threw me up against the wall and started choking me out, much to Ana's dismay, she was crying and screaming at him the whole time, telling him to stop and let me go, trying to pull him off of me. Afterwards he offered us a ride to the shelter because we had her computer and all of our clothes.. we declined the offer. This was her idea. Then she gave me the best advice I have ever gotten concerning my father. Leave. Leave and never look back. He is not safe to be around. He is not a good person. So to say we've hit quite a rough patch is somewhat of an understatement. I'm not sure if this was all TMI but I really just feel a whole lot better getting it off of my chest. Ana is my hero, she really is, she is beautiful and she makes me feel like I'm actually worth caring about. If you've read this far, thank you so much.\n\nBut alas! Some good news! We both just landed new jobs yesterday. We both got hired as sales people at Sears... I know not much, but for around here it's pretty much the best we can find. I'm an IT guy, actually I'm more of a helpdesk-break/fix-troubleshooter sort of guy but I also have worked IT jobs. We do what we can to be happy and this area doesn't have many jobs so we're trying our best. We don't have a car (in a town where the buses don't even run on sunday or after 5pm any day, no joke- [www.lctabus.com/](www.lctabus.com/)) and we spent every last penny on rent. In fact, we still haven't paid our security deposit, luckily the landlord is a good lady and is understanding of our situation. So clearly there is no money for pizza. Which is upsetting, since pizza just so happens to be our favorite food, hands down. If someone can be help, we'll be sure to share it with our little puppy Horatio, who is the most adorable dog in the world,  he just turned 3 on valentines day! Here's a picture of me and him: ([Horatio and Bill](http://i.imgur.com/ohDJi.jpg)) , and for good measure here is a picture of my girlfriend/his mommy: ([Ana](http://i.imgur.com/qHmZL.jpg)) . Anyway... we will be sure to take pictures and post them, as long as they come out nice and she doesn't hate the way she looks in them. Either way we will be sure to make some sort of post thanking you. She's actually at orientation right now and I've got online training to do. Thank god we still have the internet! We're so damn lucky that one of our neighbors has unprotected wi-fi, otherwise we wouldn't get our daily Reddit fix. Sorry for the life story, just thought you should know the people who are requesting. We love you all.\n\n.\n\nPS: When we finally get our feet on the ground we will most definitely pay it forward.

I have already been struggling and what little food I had frozen has now been spoiled, even the milk in my refridgerator. I live pay check to pay check and I did not anticipate this, I do not even have the money to purchase a gallon of milk.\n\nI was hoping one of the kind souls out there could gift me a pizza that I could enjoy with my son, it would really help so much as all we have is about 6 cup of noodles and 2 boxes of Mac and cheese (with no milk) to make it until payday this Friday.\n\nIf somebody could help me out I would be so happy, pizza from anywhere, it doesn't matter... Just something to eat.\n\nI would gladly repay the favor forward when I get paid and gift somebody else in need.\n\nThank you for listening,\nMikey \nIf a user in a community for giving away free pizza saw the above post, they would consider the post to be\nA: Persuasive\nB: Not persuasive\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.",

Due to unforeseen family drama I no longer have internet at home, and have been forced to do all of my job hunting and other internet duties on my phone. I *had* an unlimited data plan, so it wasn't much of an issue.\n\nWell, come last month I check my data and... It's not unlimited any more. I call AT&amp;amp;T about it and they changed it, said it wasn't done by anyone else on the family plan and refused to give a reason why. I've got 20GB between 6 people, 3 of which don't know to turn on WiFi for Netflix. I call my family about this and because they already hate me for being \"a gross faggot\" they assume I did something to it. I'll have to pay therm any overages we get. A few days ago I check my data and... Now it's only 10GB. I ended up paying my family $45 for another few gigs of data when we were splitting 20, now we have 10. I spent my grocery money on data, because without my phone I can't get calls from employers and my family will cancel it if I didn't.\n\nSo... I was wondering if anyone would be willing to get me a pizza. I'm only eating for one, I can trade photoshop/writing/proofreading skills if you want me to.

I'm looking forward to helping someone else out when our income is stable again.\n\nDominos, Papa Johns, and Pizza Hut are all close by. It's always a little embarrassing to have to ask for help, but I'll be very grateful if anyone could help out. \nIf a user in a community for giving away free pizza saw the above post, they would consider the post to be\nA: Persuasive\nB: Not persuasive\n\nConstraint: Answer with only the option above that is most accurate and nothing else.",

I couldn't stay in college, I live with my parents, I can't get a decent job, and when I got one, I couldn't keep it very long. So my parents basically kicked me when I was down, not making me feel any better. So a few times I've tried to hang myself, as well as try to crash my car (going 90 mph) into a barricade, only to swerve right before impact.\n\nWith that said, I've been seeing multiple doctors, which have helped me tremendously. They've been saying I have both schizotypal personality disorder and bipolar disorder. I am currently taking medication, which has helped me a lot.\n\nI am going to a psychiatrist next month to get a full diagnosis, and then I can go from there.\n\nAll I'm asking for is a pizza, to share with my dog who has been by my side for the past 4 years.

So i decided to lend him money for gas because the person seemed to be dressed properly, had a decent car, and didnt seem to be a scammer to me. he took me to the nearest atm and i thought he would just ask for 40 dollars for a full tank when he said that he would appreciate around 160 dollars which he could pay back this upcoming saturday. i had 100 dollars in my debit card...so i gave him 80. 20 for myself to buy some needed groceries. He then left repeatedly thanking me for my generosity and said that if i called him this saturday he would repay me the amount as well as a gift certificate at a restaurant that he works at.
