Elevated to the earldom of Lennox (the existing holder of the title, Robert Stewart, bishop of Caithness, having yielded to royal pressure to resign it) in 1580 and then raised to a dukedom in 1581, Lennox was loathed as a pro-French Catholic who enjoyed all too much of the king's favour.''\n''Much has been made of James as the lonely teenager desperate for affection, and no doubt this played a part. But what we are seeing here is the start of a pattern which was repeated in the case of James's other three great favourites: George Gordon, earl of Huntly; and, in England, Robert Carr, earl of Somerset, and George Villiers, duke of Buckingham. James had asserted his kingship, not his loneliness; his authority, not his dependence. Lennox, like his successors, appeared on the scene and demonstrated his usefulness, in this case in the factional struggles surrounding the king, notably in his part in Morton's final downfall.''\nRe: later favorites, court culture, question of James's sexuality in general:\n''It is in this scrambling, hothouse environment that the notorious royal favourites must be set. Sir Walter Scott introduced the note of immorality; and some modern scholars—notably literary critics—still find the question of James's homosexuality a source of great fascination. There is almost the danger of forgetting that, '''even if homosexual activity as opposed to homoerotic feeling is ascribed to the king,''' at the very least, James was bisexual, and succeeded, where his three predecessors had failed, in providing heirs to the throne, which after the previous half-century came as a welcome relief. Moreover, even if seen under the guise of courtly love, the male favourite had had as much of a political role in Elizabeth's court as James's. Whatever the sexual attractions, the main point is that James never allowed his personal feelings to dictate his political ones.''\n''It has already been suggested that Esmé Stuart has loomed too large in the early 1580s, being allowed to crowd out the other things—his poets, the beginnings of his political role—which brought the king out of his harsh childhood. In the late 1580s and 1590s Huntly was favoured when useful, attacked and (in 1596) exiled when not; equally, he had ignored factional pressure after the death of Lord Chancellor Maitland in 1595 and determined to fulfil the role himself. No amount of blandishments from the first great favourite of the English reign, the Scot Robert Carr, who rose to prominence in 1607, persuaded James to appoint one of his clients as secretary in succession to Salisbury in 1612. Carr did accumulate honours and acquire office: he was created Viscount Rochester in 1611 and earl of Somerset in 1613, and between 1612 and 1614 he exercised the functions of secretary of state. In 1613 he and his chosen bride, Lady Frances Howard, also had the all-important backing of the king in Lady Frances's efforts to get her first marriage to the earl of Essex annulled; having successfully forwarded the necessary legal proceedings and squashed the reservations of a discomforted archbishop of Canterbury, James even paid for their wedding that December. However, when in 1615 Somerset reacted to the arrival on the scene of George Villiers by behaving insolently, James put him firmly in his place. Later that year when the king heard rumours of the involvement of the earl and countess in the murder of Somerset's erstwhile adviser Sir Thomas Overbury, favour did not save them from investigation by a royal commission or from subsequent prosecution, conviction, and imprisonment in 1616, although it did save them from death.''\n''Villiers, James's greatest favourite, was appointed cupbearer to the king in 1614 and gentleman of the bedchamber in the following year; thereafter, following the downfall of Somerset, his rise was rapid: knighted and created Viscount Villiers (1616) and successively earl (1617), marquess (1618), and duke (1623) of Buckingham. Perhaps more attention should be paid to the fact that Villiers was brought to James's attention by his wife and by George Abbot, archbishop of Canterbury. Why? No doubt to undermine Somerset and his Howard allies, but this only addresses their objections to a particular favourite. What were the positive advantages they saw to providing the king with a new favourite? To amuse the king? To provide him with someone who, if necessary, would take the rap for unpopular actions or simply take some of the pressure of endless demands for patronage from his shoulders? James might give his favour initially to men of little prominence, but not to political nonentities: to retain favour they had to demonstrate that they were politically useful. Buckingham undoubtedly did, as the patronage networks became increasingly focused on him. That did not mean that the king gave up overall control. The royal chaplain and religious controversialist George Carleton at last stopped being fobbed off with minor bishoprics and got a plum, Chichester, not because his name was on Buckingham's lips, but because James had been impressed with his performance as a delegate at the Synod of Dort. Buckingham's strength was that he knew how to please his royal master. He was, of course, hated by those who failed to benefit from his patronage. There was a good deal less complaining from those who benefited from it. But under the flexible James the patronage networks remained ideologically open. No Jacobean parliament wanted to impeach Buckingham, as Charles I's first two did. It was after 1625, when Buckingham adapted to the new king, Charles I, who had nothing of the flexibility of his father, and when, to compound his increased unpopularity, disastrously went to war with both France and Spain in the same year—1627—that he was seen as a real political menace. Having survived the threat of parliamentary attacks thanks to Charles's protection, Buckingham finally died by the assassin's knife in 1628. James would never have allowed Buckingham the level of power and influence which brought him down.''\n''But the homosexual issue means that Buckingham has remained associated with James; and homosexuality has been a major factor in creating the idea of James's court as sleazy and corrupt. So it must be emphasized that neither in Scotland nor in England were the king's sexual proclivities of as much interest in his day as they later became. And the ‘corruption’ turns mainly on three episodes: the Overbury murder, which was not a homosexual scandal, and the accounts of two occasions when court entertainment went badly wrong, being swamped by drink; the first was in 1606, when James's brother-in-law Christian IV, king of Denmark—a notorious soak—came to visit, the second in 1618, when the king, grumpy and unwell, spoiled the performance of that year's court masque, and stumped off to bed, whereupon his courtiers, no doubt heartily glad to see the back of him, turned over-enthusiastically to the feasting and the drinking. It hardly amounts to ‘the’ corrupt court. There was, of course, corruption; how could there not have been? The councillors in prison in 1618–19 for financial corruption, chief among them the countess of Somerset's father, the disgraced lord treasurer Thomas Howard, earl of Suffolk, the downfall of the monopolists and no less a person than Sir Francis Bacon in 1621, and even Lionel Cranfield in 1624, all testify to the problems inherent in the factional politics and the intense rivalry for advancement and advantage in the early modern court. But the very fact that men did come to grief in that court indicates that it was not wholly out of control. Nor was it a problem confined only to the English court. It was the additional dimension of the king's favourites, in England far more than in Scotland, which skewed the picture of that court, to a quite unwarranted extent.''\n''Like James himself, all his favourites were married; all had children. The king showed a lot of affection for the wives and children, as he did for his own wife and children. Even if the love between James and Anne had worn thin, by the standards of early modern arranged royal marriages, relations between them remained remarkably good, at least well into the first decade of the seventeenth century and even to some extent in the years before her death in 1619. As for his ‘sweet boys’, Steenie and Baby Charles, at the end of his life James's letters to them took on a sugary sentimentality which reads unpleasantly by modern standards and, much more to the point, reads very differently from his earlier correspondence (Letters of James VI and I, 388–422). This did not mean that he had lost his political grip. But it does suggest, as do his late literary works, an ageing king becoming over-emotional as the confidence with which he had ruled his kingdoms began to fail him.''\nWormald's emphasis appears to be strongly on the idea that James's sexuality simply is not all that important, and that whatever the nature of James's feelings for his favorites, they also served his political ends.\nHere's what the article on Somerset, by Alastair Bellany, says on the question:\n''The exact nature of [Carr's] personal relationship with James remains difficult to assess. Carr enjoyed constant and unique access to the king's person, day and night, at Whitehall and at the hunt. The king, it was reported, would pinch Carr's cheek in public, smooth his clothes, and gaze at him adoringly, even while talking to others. Although historians disagree about whether the relationship was sexual the intensity of the king's love is evident in at least one of his few surviving letters to Carr.''\nThat on Buckingham, article by Roger Lockyer:\n''[Pembroke and Abbot's] efforts were crowned with success in April 1615, when Villiers was not only appointed gentleman of the bedchamber but was also knighted by James and given an annual pension of £1000. Later that year, in August, he and the king occupied the same bed at Farnham Castle, where the king was on progress. Sharing a bed was not uncommon in the early seventeenth century, and did not necessarily imply physical intimacy. Yet there was every indication that the relationship between the king and Villiers had entered a new phase, and that the days of Somerset's favour were numbered...\n''James continued to delight in the company of his new favourite, whom he called affectionately Steenie, a diminutive of Stephen, since St Stephen, according to the Bible, had a face like an angel. On 6 January 1617—the customary time for new year's gifts—James elevated Viscount Villiers to the earldom of Buckingham, and in the following month he was sworn of the privy council. Just under a year later, on 1 January 1618, James created Buckingham a marquess. The king made no secret of his feelings for his favourite. On the contrary, in September 1617 he declared before his privy councillors that ‘he loved the Earl of Buckingham more than any other man’ and that they should not regard this as a defect in his nature. After all, ‘Jesus Christ had done the same as he was doing … for Christ had his John and he had his George’ (Documentos ineditos para la historia de España, 1936–45, 1.101–2).''\nThat on Lennox, by Rosalind K. Marshall:\n''The young king was entranced with his charming, sophisticated 37-year-old cousin. Starved as he had been of affection throughout his childhood, James revelled in Aubigny's kindly attention. Here at last was a relative of his own, sensitive, cultured, and perceptive, who treated him as an adult, discussing theology and politics and poetry with him, respecting his views, and nurturing his self-confidence. James was overjoyed...''\n''The nature of their relationship has been the subject of much speculation, and from the start there have been allegations that Lennox introduced James not only to French poetry but also to homosexuality. According to one Scottish chronicler, ‘His majesty having conceived an inward affection to the Lord d'Aubigny, entered in great familiarity and quiet purposes with him’, while the church ministers accused the duke of setting out ‘to draw the king to carnal lust’ (ibid., 36).\n''‘I have such extreme regret that I desire to die rather than to live, fearing that that has been the occasion of your no longer loving me’, Lennox had told James in his last letter (CSP Scot., 1581–3, 223). However, it would be a mistake to read too much into the often extravagant language of the sixteenth-century courtier. Lennox's evident affection for his lonely young cousin brought him a glittering career, but there is no cause to think that he deliberately exploited the king's adolescent sexuality for his own benefit. Whatever James's later sexual preferences, it is not unusual for a young adolescent to hero-worship a handsome and accomplished older man, and it may be that, closely related by blood as they were, they shared a genuine sense of affinity. It was undeniably a personal tragedy for them both when their mutually rewarding friendship evoked the bitter enmity of the Scottish courtiers and led to their final separation.''\nAt any rate, the general consensus of these various articles would seem to be that, well, we aren't terribly sure of anything.  Wormald seems to say that his feelings for his favorites were at least \"homoerotic,\" but not necessarily homosexual.  None of the other articles goes further than this.  This seems to be about as far as we can (and should) go.  \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack?  \n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either \"True\" or \"False\" with without using any other words.\n",

'''''The M3 CFV was originally going to be named after General Jacob L. Devers, but it was decided the Bradley name would apply to both, since both vehicles are based on the same chassis (they differ in only some details)'''''. The M2 carries a crew of three and a six-man infantry squad. The M3 on the other hand carries only a two-man scout team and additional radios, TOW and Dragon or Javelin missiles. Where did you find the source for this statement? According to '''''Camp Colt:...''''', the Bradley was always to be a composite vehicle, designed specifically to satisfy the needs of both Infantry and Cavalry. That being true, and given the Army's naming conventions of using a common name for all versions of a program that share all or most components, it is highly unlikely that they would assign a seperate name for what is - for want of a better description - essentially an identical vehicle which is internally re-arranged to fulfill similar but distinct missions. \nThatguy96: The M3 Bradley CFV is a designation confirmed by Army sources.  While it seems that they do not warrant different designations, it is likely that the history behind who it was to be named after had some part in the desire for a seperate designation.  By your logic there should have been no way that the XM107 rifle could have come into being, since it should have been, from all accounts a variant of the M82 rifle, already type classified.  The Army is well known for its refusal to change things once on paper, and it was likely that after the M3 Devers CFV designation was dropped, it was simply easier to change the name rather than the entire designation.  \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack?  \n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either \"True\" or \"False\" with without using any other words.\n",

Whereas you object to \"queer\" with or without its negative uses, you embrace \"homosexual\" while turning a blind eye to its ambiguous status due to negative uses and connotations (medicalization, anti-gay linguistic practice, etc.). How contradictory. Please take your beefs with language change to some forum as this article and the LGBT series template are not a sounding boards for your emotional bias.

In my opinion, accusing another editor being anti-LGBT (i.e., accusing that editor of homophobia) is crossing a very serious line, particularly when you offer no real evidence that the target of your accusation is motivated by opposition to homosexuality or gay culture itself and no such motivation is immediately self-evident in that editor's commentary.  Really, is this an issue that merits this level of vitriol?  If so, I would have to say that it takes two to tango and any strong emotional investment you may have in the label LGBT is as likely to contribute to the conflict as any other editor's imputed bias.\n To offer a constructive outcome, may I suggest another route to resolving the conflict? Rather than arguing over replacing \"LGBT\" with \"homosexual\", which does not appear to offer any possible outcome upon which we can form consensus, can we then address the other side of the equation and replace \"heterosexual\" with \"straight\"?  This would resolve what I see as the valid kernel of 's objection (preserving clarity and consistency by contrasting a cultural-identity label to a cultural-identity label), and it does so without giving the appearance of indulging in \"erasure\".    \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack?  \n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either \"True\" or \"False\" with without using any other words.\n",

People claimed that nobody says \"Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope\" and rather instead say \"Star Wars\".  That's just really odd to claim. I don't know how it has been when the original trilogy came out because I wasn't born during the original trilogy.  However, I was born before the Phantom Menace came out.  Trust me, ''many, many'' people refer to the films as \"Star Wars Episode (whatever episode number): Subtitle\".  The official Star Wars website lists the names as so here.  I am aware of the rebuttals at this in previous discussions, and that COMMON is preferred but there was no support for that statement that made sense.  Google Trends and Google NGrams can't be used because when searching for Star Wars (because Star Wars (film) won't show up in any books) in Ngrams you'll get any books that mention the name Star Wars regardless of what episode.  I am aware Google Trends allows you to search for Star Wars which is the default when searching for Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, but that's most likely influenced by Wikipedia itself as most Google Searches are. (Ever wonder why they include Wikipedia entries on the side?)  It also just says 1977 film under it. And I have a bad feeling (no pun intended) that the term Star Wars, even when using the Star Wars (film), is giving results to Star Wars films that aren't just A New Hope.  If you look at the Google Trend here, you'll see that the Star Wars term is skyrocketing in May 2005, when Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith came out. So... yeah... probably not talking about Episode IV.  This graph from Google Trends, shows a strong result for Star Wars Episode IV A New Hope in May 2005 also.  This graph, here, shows that the Empire Strikes Back is not as popular as the Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back term. It also, as a search term alone, appears dominate (except for the fall off in the month of Feb 2015 which is still quite young) here shows a dominate use of the full title. Anyways, so that's basically my input and reasoning for the move of the Star Wars films. Other films, such as Raiders of the Lost Ark default on Google Trends to Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark as seen here.  \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack?  \n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either \"True\" or \"False\" with without using any other words.\n",

However, investigations have shown that no such letter was published in any of the four Saturday Review issues released that month.[2][3] The letter was allegedly re-published in This I Believe: Selections from the Writings of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., but no book by that name has ever been located.[2][4]\nTim Wise suggests that it originated with Marc Schneier, who published portions of it in Shared Dreams: Martin Luther King Jr. and the Jewish Community that year.[2\nFadi Kiblawi and Will Youmans have questioned the authenticity of Lipset's account. According to their research, a Harvard Crimson article published on April 8, 1968 (after King's death) stated that King had not been to Cambridge since April 23, 1967. Stanford University's archives also show no speeches by King in Cambridge or Boston in 1968.[4]\nThe false letter was quoted by Ariel Sharon before the Knesset on January 26, 2005.[7] It has also been cited by the Anti-Defamation League in testimony before the United States House of Representatives.[4] Other prominent individuals quoting the letter include Natan Sharansky (in a November 2003 issue of Commentary) and Mortimer Zuckerman (in a September 2001 issue of U.S. News & World Report).[2][7]\nTim Wise notes that King \"appears never to have made any public comment about Zionism per se.\" According to Wise, the Lipset quote does not support the \"claim that opposition to Zionism was inherently anti-Semitic,\" and the comment in question may have been limited to the specific circumstances: we \"can only speculate\" what King might say about the modern-day Israeli–Palestinian conflict.[2] Fadi Kiblawi and Will Youmans suggest that a reliance on King's views in this matter constitutes a fallacious argument from authority, since Middle East issues were not among King's areas of expertise. They also suggest that the Lipset quote, if genuine, was a reply to explicitly anti-white and anti-Semitic militancy of the time, and that most modern-day renditions omit this \"crucial context.\"[4]  \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack?  \n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either \"True\" or \"False\" with without using any other words.\n",

The Hunno-Bulgarian language exhibits non-Turkic and non-Altaic features. Altaic has no initial consonant clusters, while Hunno-Bulgarian does.

    "91": "Bcorr: Almost three years ago I was able to help a number of different editors with very different opinions and understandings of the violence in Gujarat in 2002. based on that experience, I am offering to help and making a proposal about a way forward. In the interim I have served as a member of and the chair of the Mediation Committee. I am making this proposal as an informal, unofficial mediation — not as part of the standard Wikipedia dispute resolution process.\nHere is my proposal for moving forward over the next week:\n'''First, I'm proposing a five-day period for working on a new version of the article that will be based on common agreement''' —– it won't be comprehensive or final, but the goal is that it will serve as the core around which future editing and writing can take place. I will place that article on a temporary page. During that period, I will ask that people continue to refrain from editing the 2002 Gujarat violence article and instead work on the new article on the temporary page.\nAssuming feedback on this proposal is generally positive over the next 48 hours, '''the five days will begin two days from now at this time (4 p.m. EST on 9 Aug 2006/21:00 UTC on 9 Aug 2006/2:30 in New Delhi on 10 Aug 2006).''' At the end of the five days, I will move the new article to 2002 Gujarat violence and begin with that.\n'''Second, in the new article, I am asking that contributors only add content that ''they believe that all contributors will agree with.''''' If there is disagreement, I am asking that contributors discuss that on the talk page for the temporary article  not on this page  Talk:2002 Gujarat violence. I am also asking that contributors refrain from removing content that they disagree with, but instead allow me to make suggestions about how to handle disagreements  remembering that my goal is to create something that we can all agree on as a basis for making progress on this article. I will note that this will involve some judgment calls on may part when it comes to deciding how much of the article is devoted to the \"some people say X, while others say Y\" content  I ask that people go along with me for the time being. I will add any disputed facts, sources, or links to a section of the talk page for the temporary article.\n'''Third, I am proposing the following guidelines for editing and for the talk pages:'''\n'''Editing'''\n1. Sign all posts to the talk page.\n2. Avoid characterizing the politics, motives, POV, or objectivity of material added to the article. Simple explain what you disagree with and why you disagree based on accuracy or that it disagrees with your point of view and then explain briefly what yours is.\n3. Avoid extrapolation of the above, e.g., \"X supports Y, so if X says ___, it must be…\"\n4. Work from the assumption for the five-day period that no one has a monopoly on the truth, even if one is certain that facts or evidence is 100 percent clear.\n'''Talk pages'''\n1. Refrain from personal attacks.\n2. Refrain from characterizing the politics, motives, POV, or objectivity of other contributors.\nObviously this is all voluntary, but I believe this is a way that we can all move forward and create an article that is NPOV, factual, informative, and still reflects the differences in opinions and the interpretations of the facts.\n'''Please respond below this line.'''

You and some others expressed other opinions on various subjects, but you did not obtain a consensus that it would be wrong to quote Harrison directly.  Please stop reverting this work.  We could discuss here what would be some process to move forward with this page.  \nDoncram: In particular, a way forward would be for you to write a new passage about one of the bathhouses, and insert that before or after Harrison's quote.  If your passage is in fact new writing and not just plagiarized, and you could explain your sources, I expect we could agree to eliminate Harrison's quote.  I suggest testing some approach to make small changes like that for awhile, rather than investing in making multiple edits which have the appearance of being a mask to executing a big revert.  Your previous edits, although they may include some other changes, effectively constitute a big revert of the page back to a state where Harrison is not credited by quotation marks.   \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack?  \n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either \"True\" or \"False\" with without using any other words.\n",

Nevertheless, certain facts emerge. Usually they are assumed to have spoken Tocharian language, but Tocharian is first attested in the 8th c. AD, that is, about 3 thousand years after the earliest detected Caucasoids in the region of Tarim Basin and Xinjiang, North China. Assuming linguistic continuity does not seem to be an appropriate default position in the absence of direct evidence. There is evidence that Caucasoid population in Tarim Basin  were already mixed with Mongoloids as early as the early Bronze Age (at least in their mtDNA).http://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7007-8-15 This reduces our confidence that they spoke an Indo-European language. An attempt to discover the origin of the Tocharians was made by a careful sorting of Y-chromosome lineages in the present-day Uyghur population of Xinjiang that is assumed to have absorbed the pre-Turkic inhabitants of the region. By removing Eurasian lineages that are likely to be associated with the Xiongnu, Mongols, Uyghur, and non-Tocharian sources (such as Iranians, or various Silk Road outliers), the phylogeographic analysis leaves three candidate haplogroups  J2-M172, R1a1a-M17, R1b-M343 (and its main R-M269 clade).http://dienekes.blogspot.bg/2011/05/on-tocharian-origins.html About 80% of the total genetic variation in modern Bulgarians falls within haplogroups J-M172, R-M17 and R-M269, E-M35, I-M170.http://www.abstractsonline.com/Plan/ViewAbstract.aspx?sKey=006d5e3a-ea14-49ff-9b39-f0a042d39185&cKey;=bfc88c56-5e93-4ee2-89e6-c3ab1bd25f5c&mKey;=%7BDFC2C4B1-FBCD-433D-86DD-B15521A77070%7D Because the haplogroups E-M35 and I-M170 are indigenous for the Balkan Peninsula prior to the arrival of the Bulgars, this leads to the conclusion that there is an isomorphic correspondence between the haplogroups that can be associated with Tocharian related Yuezhi and the haplogroups that can be associated with the proto-Bulgarians (Bulgars). The conclusion correlates with the historical data that modern Bulgarians have three ethnic ancestors - Bulgars, Slavs and Thracians.\n'''Language'''\nOmeljan Pritsak in his notable study \"The Hunnic Language of the Attila Clan\" (1982) http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/huri/files/vvi_n4_dec1982.pdf analyzed the 33 survived Hunnic personal names and concluded that the language of the Bulgars was Hunnic language:\nDanube-Bulgarian had the suffix /mA/, with the same meaning as the Middle Turkic suffix /mAt/ 'the greatest among'(page 433)\nIn the Hunno-Bulgarian languages /r/ within a consonantic cluster tends to disappear (page 435)\nThere was initially a g- in the Hunno-Bulgarian languages (page 449)\nAccording to Pritsak the language was between Turkic and Mongolian, probably closer to Turkic.\nAccording to Antoaneta Granberg the Hunno-Bulgarian language was formed on the Northern and Western borders of China in the 3rd-5th c.

The Huns and Proto-Bulgarians spoke the same language, different from all other “barbarian” languages. When Turkic tribes appeared at the borders of the Chinese empire in the 6th c., the Huns and Proto-Bulgarians were no longer there.Pulleyblank 1963: 239-265 It is important to note that Turkic does contain Hunno-Bulgarian loans, but that these were received through Chinese intermediary, e.g. Hunnic ch’eng-li ‘sky, heaven’ was borrowed from Chinese as tängri in TurkicPulleyblank 1963:240 The Hunno-Bulgarian language exhibits non-Turkic and non-Altaic features. Altaic has no initial consonant clusters, while Hunno-Bulgarian does. Unlike Turkic and Mongolian, Hunno-Bulgarian language has no initial dental or velar spirants. Unlike Turkic, it has initial voiced b-: bagatur (a title), boyla (a title). Unlike Turkic, Hunno-Bulgarian has initial n-, which is also encountered in Mongolian: Negun, Nebul (proper names). In sum, Antoaneta Granberg concludes that Hunno-Bulgarian language  has no consistent set of features that unite it with either Turkic or Mongolian. Neither can it be related to Sino-Tibetian languages, because it obviously has no monosyllabic word structure.\nAssuming that the connection Yuezhi->Hunno-Bulgars was substantiated enough we can try to find explanation in the preserved data about the language of Yuezhi/Kushans and see if we can find some correspondence. Some scholars have explained the words connecting the Yuezhi 月氏 or the Kushans as\ncoming from the Turkic languages, thus concluding that the language of the Kushans was from the Türkic language branch.  this theory is inadequate. In the Zhoushu 周書, ch. 50, it is recorded that: “The ancestors [of the Türks] came from the state of Suo 索.”34 It has been suggested that “Suo\n索” [sheak] is a transcription of “Sacae.” In other words, it may be possible that the ancestors of the Türks originally were kin of the Sacae. If this is true, it would not be difficult to understand why some words and titles connected with the Yuezhi 月氏 or the Kushans can be explaned by\nthe Türkic languages. In the Rājataraṅgiṇī (I, 170) there is a reference to the fact that the Türkic ruler in Gandhāra claimed his ancestor was Kaniṣka, and maybe this is not merely boasting. Other scholars have judged that the language of the Kushans was the Iranian language. This\ntheory is also inadequate, for the following reasons. First, they were a branch of the Sacae, a tribal union composed of at least four tribes, i.e., Asii, Gasiani, Tochari and Sacarauli. Of these there were some tribes who spoke the Iranian language, but also some who spoke Indo-European languages other than the Iranian language, e.g., the Tochari. Next, the tribes that spoke Tokharian were in close contact with the tribes that spoke the Iranian language, and the words connected to them that can be explained with Iranian possibly originally were Tokharian.http://sino-platonic.org/complete/spp212_kushan_guishuang.pdf page 15\n'''History'''\nAccording to Procopius, there was a nation of Huns living to the east of the Sea of Azov and north of the Caucasus, the king of these Huns had two sons, Kutigur and Utigur. The king referred by Procopius is most probably Ernak, the third son of Attila. After the death of the king, the two sons divided the people into two tribes. Analyzing the chronicles of the antique historians Vasil Zlatarski concludes that the name Bulgar was used for both tribes, but in  6th century the tribal names were preferred by the Eastern Roman Empire due to the different policy it had toward these two tribes.Васил Н. Златарски\nИстория на Първото българско Царство, page 75 In the middle of 6th century the Emperor Justinian, being attacked by the Kutrigurs under their leader Chinialus, bribed their relatives the Utigurs led by Sandilch to attacked the Kutrigurs in the rear. The resulting internecine war between the two tribes weakened them and made them vulnerable to the Avar attack shortly after that.The Huns, Rome and the Birth of Europe, Hyun Jin Kim,page 142, https://books.google.bg/books?id=jCpncXFzoFgC&pg;=PA132&dq;=Utigur+attila&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0CB8Q6AEwAGoVChMIs9-UmKyQxwIVBKJyCh0V0wQM#v=onepage&q;=Sandilch%20&f;=false\nBy 568CE some Kutrigurs groups came under the control of the Varchonites who were migrating to Pannonia and was also known as Avars. The eastern Bulgar groups along the northern coasts of the Black sea, the Utigurs, were conquered by the Western Turkic Kaghanate (who were violently opposed to the Pannonian Avars). Due to civil war the Western Turks retreated back into Asia no later than 583 CE according to Zlatarski.\nKubrat's Utigurs defeated the Avars in alliance with Byzantium and reunited the Utigurs and Kutrigurs into a single Crimean Bulgar confederation in Patria Onoguria renamed as \"Old Great Bulgaria\"\nAfter Kubrat's death in 665AD, his empire was dividedRunciman, Book I, The Children of the Huns, page 16-17 when his appointed heir Batbayan submitted to the Khazars of Kubrat's second son Kotrag who settled Batbayan's army at the confluence of the Volga and Kama rivers where they founded a Khanate known as Volga Bulgaria.Heritage of Scribes: The Relation of Rovas Scripts to Eurasian Writing Systems, Gábor Hosszú, Rovas Foundation, 2012, ISBN 9638843748, p. 287.\nOther sons of Kubrat carried the Utigur name to the Danube and Pannonia Secunda by April 677.

Following the Battle of Ongal, Asparukh settled a portion of the Utigur Bulgars in Moesia, to establish the state which would become modern Bulgaria. In the 8th century, the Kuber Bulgars merged with Asparuh's Bulgars who had by the late 7th century already taken both sides of the Danube River. \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack?  \n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either \"True\" or \"False\" with without using any other words.\n",

    "165": "TJive: I just finished reading the actual article in question, and not only is Mr. Huntington being misrepresented, he is being plagiarized.\nHuntington's basis thesis is that for a brief period while the Cold War was winding up the world entered a unipolar state where the US could assert its policy with a bare minimum of resistance, but this time quickly passed in favor of a \"uni-multipolar\" world where the US attempts to set the agenda and regional powers undermine it without taking a formal step towards coalescing against the strongest power.  He implicitly and explicitly recommends reassessing US policy the better to focus on key national interests rather than attempting to universalize American values, giving nods to Brzezinski and the Bismarckian tradition.  With respect to realistic advice for American foreign policy this is not only ''not'' representative of neo-conservatism but the furthest thing from it.\nNow, take this paragraph from the contested passage;\nTo reassert its status in the post-Cold War world, the United States has attempted or been perceived as attempting more or less unilaterally to do the following: pressure other countries to adopt U.S. values and practices regarding neoliberal economic policy and \"human rights\"; promote U.S. corporate interests by supporting policies of \"free trade\" and \"open markets\"; shape International Monetary Fund and World Bank policies to serve those interests; pressure other countries to adopt economic policies and social policies that will benefit U.S. interests; intervene in local conflicts in which it has little direct interest on the surface; grade countries according to their adherence to U.S. standards on \"free markets,\" \"terrorism,\" \"human rights,\" drugs, and weapons proliferation; enforce U.S. law extraterritorially in other societies; apply sanctions against countries that do not meet U.S. standards on these issues; prevent other countries from acquiring military capabilities that could counter U.S. conventional superiority; promote the interests of U.S. arms producers such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Raytheon, abroad while attempting to prevent comparable sales by other countries; expand NATO to the borders of the former Soviet Union; force out one United Nations Secretary-General and dictate the appointment of his successor; categorize certain countries as \"rogue states,\" excluding them from international institutions because of their strained relations with Washington; and undertake military action against Iraq and later maintain harsh economic sanctions against the government of Saddam Hussein.\nAs well as this from Huntington:\nAmerican foreign policy is in considerable measure driven by such beliefs. In the past few years the United States has, among other things, attempted or been perceived as attempting more or less unilaterally to do the following: pressure other countries to adopt American values and practices regarding human rights and democracy; prevent other countries from acquiring military capabilities that could counter American conventional superiority; enforce American law extraterritorially in other societies; grade countries according to their adherence to American standards on human rights, drugs, terrorism, nuclear proliferation, missile proliferation, and now religious freedom; apply sanctions against countries that do not meet American standards on these issues; promote American corporate interests under the slogans of free trade and open markets; shape World Bank and International Monetary Fund policies to serve those same corporate interests; intervene in local conflicts in which it has relatively little direct interest; bludgeon other countries to adopt economic policies and social policies that will benefit American economic interests; promote American arms sales abroad while attempting to prevent comparable sales by other countries; force out one U.N. secretary-general and dictate the appointment of his successor; expand NATO initially to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic and no one else; undertake military action against Iraq and later maintain harsh economic sanctions against the regime; and categorize certain countries as \"rogue states,\" excluding them from global institutions because they refuse to kowtow to American wishes.\nRather than deferring to Huntington as the author of what the US has \"attempted or been perceived as attempting....to do\", the selection merely copies his assertions with the derisory addition of quotes to the phrases \"free markets\", \"human rights\", and \"terrorism\" which attempts to legitimate the theft of content in its selectivity of direct attribution.  This seems rather unacceptable to me, so I have attempted to compromise the wording which takes into account all views and gives explicit reference.  \nTrey Stone: Look, see Wikipedia:No original research.

    "183": "Danish Expert: This is just to bump a short note, explaining why no detailed news is reported in the article about the current negotiations between Greece and the Troika in 2015. The simple reason is, that nothing notable really happened since the Syriza-government won the election. A lot of posturing and comments were made by the new Greek government, but no notable movement/action took place. Hopefully we can soon write a subchapter explaining the contents of some new re-negotiated and implemented terms for the current Troika bailout programme, but until that happens everything is pretty much up in the air.\nAfter having followed the topic quiet intense, I am a bit concerned about the recent political statements made by various Greek government spokesmen, as it appear they either \"say something which they know is not possible/true\" (as part of attempting to score easy political points and/or appear more responsible than they actually are)\" or suffer from a complete unawareness of the fundamental rules of the eurozone. In example, Varoufakis continue to suggest, as of 14 May 2015, that ECB through a debt-swap should reschedule the Greek government repayments of earlier issued ECB-bonds (suggesting Draghi is willing to do it - if the Bundesbank did not restrain his maneuver options) - although all of us having passed the basic course in EU politics know that both the letter of the founding Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union and the ECB statute strictly prohibit ECB from conducting fiscal policy and/or offer debt-finance or debt-relief to some of its members (which is something that only the Eurogroup can make political decisions about). Asking ECB to unease liquidity constraints and/or reschedule debt repayments is simply equal to ask for something which is not an available tool in the tool box (they can not do something which the treaty prohibit them to do - and therefor solely base their liquidity offers to the Greek financial system based on observations for their specific needs - and not the potential need for funds subsequently to get transferred from the Greek banks to the Greek government - and if the Greek government at some point of time is incapable of repaying what they owe to ECB then ECB will keep their repayment claims unaltered - leaving a scenario of either a sovereign default or the Eurogroup+IMF to come to the rescue by offering a new third bailout programme so that Greece can honor its repayment commitments). Likewise, it is pretty clear that all locked bailout funds in the current bailout programme, can only be unlocked the moment the Troika review find that Greece actually has implemented all of the original payment terms - or alternatively some mutually agreed substituting terms - before this happen the Eurogroup (which it made absolutely clear through various statements issued since February 2015), will not approve the unlocking of any remaining frozen bailout pledges in the current programme - and they even clarified that before the current programme had been successfully completed by Greece \"no negotiations would start about a potential third follow-up programmme for covering the Greek needs after 1 July 2015\". Despite of this very clear fact, the Greek government repeatedly suggest towards the media, that an extraordinary Eurogroup will soon be called to approve a new deal, which is direct (intended/unintended) misinformation, as we all know (except apparently the Greek government) that the Troika needs both: (1) First to strike a mutually agreed deal with the Greek government about some renewed payment terms and (2) then publish an updated review-report concluding such terms have actually been implemented by the Greek government (through laws in parliament), before (3) The Eurogroup then finally can approve releasing the remaining funds in the current bailout-programme (which in best case - because of all the work before then still needed to be done - now only is possible at the earliest in the second half of June 2015). To conclude, this extra topic about potential \"unawareness of fundamental rules of the eurozone\", is also something I currently hesitate to write a sub-chapter about, at least for the moment, as it might too be a temporary non-notable event and/or just a \"political game\".\nAs we are all right now in a waiting game to learn what exactly happens, this is also the explanation why no specific \"negotiation news\" so far has been added to the article. We are all waiting for specific substantial news, which hopefully soon will arrive. \nThanatos666: Please abstain from such commentaries and stick to the facts as much as possible; let me just say that your views on the EU/€Ζ '''Power Game''' - cause that's what it is in short - are not universally accepted... ;-) PS1.

The use of kilometres rather than miles violates the principle of least astonishment.

    "203": "Tradedia: I believe that the situation concerning the 5 red towns in Lajat area, Daraa was not handled correctly. The background of this is in: Talk:Cities and towns during the Syrian Civil War/Archive 46#Mseikeh & NE Daraa, Talk:Cities and towns during the Syrian Civil War/Archive 46#Regime offensive in Busr Al Harir and Talk:Cities and towns during the Syrian Civil War/Archive 46#Supply lines to Lajat reopened. What happened is that the gov took the 5 villages in the Lajat area therefore isolating a rebel pocket.\nLater, on April 21, 2015, the following 2 things happened:\nAs-Safir newspaper reported that the gov took the 5 villages in the Lajat area therefore isolating a rebel pocket.\nOn Sky News Arabic TV there was an interview of Rami Abdel Rahman (head of SOHR) who said that the gov troops were forced out of all the villages that they took yesterday in Lajat area, and that the rebel’s road was reopened.\nIt seems that the editors at that time followed the first source and discarded the second source, so the villages stayed red. I think that what happened was that the editors mistook the As-Safir source for “Al-monitor” source which they considered a reliable source. On the other hand, they considered Sky News Arabic as a pro-rebel source. The assessment was flawed. You have to realize that Al-monitor sometimes translates articles from the As-Safir newspaper. This is the case of the above article. You can see in the “Summary box” the following sentence: “In this article from As-Safir, Tarek al-Abed provides detailed updates on the field developments in Syria and the status and spreading of armed groups.” Here is a link that gives additional information on how Al-Monitor works (I don’t recommend you read it as it is long and boring).\nAs-Safir newspaper leans towards the Syrian gov and is therefore not more neutral or less biased than Sky News Arabic. Moreover, we use on the map SOHR as a reliable source, which gives credibility to an interview of its head on a TV show. Also, it could be argued that a TV show on April 21, 2015 talks about the events of that specific day, whereas a newspaper article would be more about the previous day given the delay in printing the newspaper.\nTherefore, the first source (As-Safir) should not have dominated the second source (SOHR head on Sky News Arabic). The conclusion should have been that the information is not clear and the 5 villages should not have stayed red. Today, even pro-gov PetoLucem map does not have them red. Given all the above, there is serious doubt about the present status of these 5 villages. Therefore, these 5 villages should be commented out until fresh information about them becomes available. \nSûriyeya:   So probably we can remove them(Miskiya al-Sharqiya,Miskiya al-Sharqiya,Rassum Al-Khawaabi,Ishnaan and Al-Dalasat) from the map before as we not have a new data about which of side hold them.   \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack?  \n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either \"True\" or \"False\" with without using any other words.\n",

Natasha is able to look into people’s bodies and correctly diagnose their medical problems, without any help from ultra-sound or x-ray equipment.\"\nNeutral?! The Discovery Channel program is primarily about a scientific test of Natasha's claims that found no evidence of such powers. Yet this article states that Natasha can \"quite literally see right through people's bodies and correctly diagnose their medical problems.\" It makes absolutely NO mention that she was tested by researchers, or that they concluded she is doing nothing more than using a cold reading technique commonly used by astrologers, palm readers, and other fortune-telling charlatans.\nDreadlocke insists that he's only interested in establishing a neutral point of view in the Natasha Demkina article. Yet he calls the Discovery Channel article, \"fairly neutral.\"  Nothing that he's ever posted here shows his own lack of neutrality as much as that statement. The Discovery Channel article claims that Natasha has supernatural powers that she is using to help people find out what is making them sick, without any mention that scientific researchers tested her and found only evidence of deception. He calls this a \"fairly neutral\" point of view.\nIt's clear why he is so unhappy with the Natasha Demkina article. And it should be clear that he won't be happy until it is as \"neutral\" as the Discovery Channel article, which claims that Natasha Demkina is helping people with her amazing paranormal powers, while doctors are mystified.

Or so the postcolonialists say\"\nThis view is not what the lead reflects. With regard to its origin, to the uninitiated, caste is ' thought of as an ancient fact of Hindu life' and 'is the result of the British colonial regime'. I have mentioned it earlier as well. It is the first sentence on the origins of caste system in the lead and it directly comes to Colonialism as if there has been no time period such as ancient, and pre - British India. I assume the article is not only about the caste system in Colonial and post colonial India. Further the lead has 5 references to affirmative action based on caste, which I believe is POV pushing.\nPS: How do I cite sources and request for a rewrite? Here in talk page?

Wikipedia is about verifiable evidence, and this article has 41 primary sources, which carry infinitely more weight than what any modern commentator thinks, as well as 22 commentators, most of whom spent far more time on this than Sen, months or years rather than days. There is a vast amount of evidence (not Bowbrick) that the yield statistics at the time were meaningless. There is a vast amount of evidence (not Bowbrick) that there was widespread hunger in the production districts. There is a vast amount of evidence (not Bowbrick) on interference with the supply system. There is a vast amount of evidence (not Bowbrick) showing that the Bengal Government had the same diagnosis as Sen. And any competent agricultural economist will do the calculations to see how much more people would have to eat to cause a famine in the way postulated by Sen – it is a simple calculation, not a matter of counting citations. Sen got nearly all his facts for his from the Famine Inquiry Commission report, though he was accused of misstating more than 30 of them and neither he nor anyone else has denied this – he avoided the issue in his reply to Bowbrick. His “causes of famine” were lifted verbatim from the Famine Inquiry Commission (without acknowledgement!) but he had not read the report carefully enough to realize that both the FIC and Braund had presented them as hypotheses to be tested – and the ones Sen based his arguments on were rejected as being completely contradicted by the evidence. Not by one modern commentator, but by a mass of contemporary evidence and analysis. But the point of Wikipedia is that it identifies the controversies and the sources: if you have the population statistics and consumption statistics, it takes 5 minutes to see if a famine could have been caused in the way Sen says. It takes you 2 or 3 hours to see whether Sen or Bowbrick is right on what Sen’s sources really said. The article does not take a position on this: it is up to you to do the work and draw your own conclusions.  \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack?  \n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either \"True\" or \"False\" with without using any other words.\n",

'''There is no such thing presently as ''sustainable cities'' so where does that come from? Could someone name a sustainable city?'''\nFor humans to live sustainably, the Earth's resources must be used at a rate at which they can be replenished naturally. '''This is not actually a fact and means almost nothing in context''' However, there is now clear scientific evidence that humanity is living unsustainably, and that an unprecedented collective effort is needed to return keep human use of natural resources to within sustainable limits.'''This leads magically into U.N. material then, which should be in a separate area'''\nSince the 1980s, through the influence of the United Nations global program for sustainable development, the idea of human sustainability has become increasingly associated with the integration of economic, social and environmental spheres to “meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” '''This is biased, and not neutral and is not appropriate in this section.''' Could these obvious things be corrected for starters? Is it really a good idea to advertise the U.N. as the one to integrate economics... social ... and environmental spheres??. That is pretty overtly an advert for an organization and not neutral in the least. The article is not called ''Sustainability and the U.N.'' That would be a different article.  \nGranitethighs: Thanks Skip, we need a \"devils advocate\". Opening sentence: \"maintain\" is a good general \"sustain\" word \"indefinitely\" well ... maybe, not fussed. I agree with your \"says who?\" On the UN: so far as the article is concerned I am not in the least bit concerned whether the UN is good, bad, indifferent, peddling propaganda, a front for dark forces or whatever. Its influence is undeniable and a fact (witness the constant reference to its definition of sustainability). I think you have an issue here and I'm not sure where you are coming from. This statement is in no way promoting the UN simply objectively stating its influence. So far as I'm concerned this statement is a neutral observation of fact. The other comments do not really deserve reply - if you think they are critical I will - I think they are already answered here.    \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack?  \n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either \"True\" or \"False\" with without using any other words.\n",

By and large, supposed \"experts\" may claim Jesus didn't exist, but really Wil Durant's point is the same as is made by the vast majority of people who have read the Gospel (especially nominal Christians, but even non-Christians like Ghandi pointed to the wisdom of the writings as laudable) that the story and principles presented in the Gospels are by far much too compelling and honest, even after first read, to be discarded out of hand as a forgery, mythology, con-job or fairytale. People died, even then in the first century, because of their belief in that person. Do con artists sacrifice themselves based on the \"ideals\" of their lies? Never. It's easy to tear down. Who is willing to build up? More importantly, who is willing to take up the responsibility of accepting that Jesus was a real person? I submit that the accounts presented in the gospels are honest and accurate. Why is this opinion not presented except in a very minimal way in this supposedly NPOV article?\n67.180.24.204: \"Do con artists sacrifice themselves based on the \"ideals\" of their lies? Never.\" Jim Jones, David Koresh, Marshall Applewhite\n\"even our calendar is purpotedly based on his arrival\" January  Janus, February  Februus, etc\nWhy would evidence supporting the existence of Jesus be a good thing.  Isn't the test of avoiding hell supposed to be one of faith?  Isn't evidence the enemy of faith, and the ally of science?  It is God's work to cast doubt on Jesus, for then we believe through our faith rather than our reason  which is nothing but a tool of Satan. \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack?  \n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either \"True\" or \"False\" with without using any other words.\n",

It's very simple: when the Israeli military (or, conversely, the Jordanian military, if you like) crossed the boundaries for the territory that had been allocated to the Jewish state (Palestinian state), it was expanded the territory under its control. It was ''not'' expanding its internationally recognized borders; the UN, rather than recognizing the military advances, could have said, \"everyone go back home, where home means what was allocated to you under the partition plan.\" (Yes, I know; the UN would never do anything that required that much spine, but they do have the authority to do it.)

    "355": "Authalic: While I was looking into the various ways that relativity is accounted for in the Global Positioning System, I came across one correction which should probably be mentioned here.  Nearly all of the relativity effects are accounted for at the control station and in the clock frequencies, but there is a small correction which takes place in the receiver.\nThe satellite orbits are slightly elliptical (e=0.02) which causes the velocity of the satellites and their positions relative to earth to change over their complete orbits.  It is my understanding that the relativity effect arising from the elliptical orbit is slight (it could lead to a ranging error of ~14 meters out of more than 20,000 km).  It is also regular and easily predictable.  I read a few sources which state that a correction factor is included in the satellite message and these corrections are performed in the receiver software.  As a result, they're invisible in most user applications.  Search for \"eccentricity\" in these sources: ,  (see '''The Eccentricity Correction''' section), and .  - \nMdf: I'm sad to say it, but my predictions are coming true:  more bullshit is creeping back into this article.  From the \"Relativity\" section, I read:\n''GPS receivers typically do not need to make any relativistic corrections because the errors introduced by relativistic effects on the recievers are negligibleless than one centimeter, for receivers on or near the earth's surface.[15]''\nThe cited reference connects the claim not to receivers, but to the elements of the control segment of the GPS system.  As you have correctly pointed out (and I mentioned a few weeks ago, see above), the receivers do apply a by-the-book relativistic eccentric correction, amounting to some 15 metres.  I am asking the author of the above sentence to re-write it to reflect the contents of the source he is quoting, or, in the alternative, simply remove it altogether.   \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack?  \n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either \"True\" or \"False\" with without using any other words.\n",
    "356": "46.208.234.40: As is well known in the ME/CFS world, it is greatly in the interests of the disability insurance industry to make ME/CFS look as if it were an \"all in the mind\" disorder caused by psychogenic or biopsychosocial factors, rather than a disease with organic biological causes. This is because disability insurance rules generally stipulate that disability due to biological disease is covered for lifelong disability support payments where necessary, but disability due to mental health disorders are not covered for lifelong support. Thus the insurance industry can save billions in disability payouts if they make it appear that ME/CFS is an \"all in the mind\" mental disorder, rather than the organic biologically-caused disease that most scientific biomedical researchers view it to be. Indeed, the psychiatrists who have most promoted the idea that ME/CFS is an \"all in the mind\"  biopsychosocial condition — people like Simon Wessely, and Prof Peter White — have been paid by disability insurance companies for their work, in spite of the obvious conflict of interest.\nThus the fact that this article has a strong bias towards presenting ME/CFS as an biopsychosocial condition (a bias which is not supported by any science) suggests that some of the main editors here who are promoting the biopsychosocial view may be paid stooges for the disability insurance industry. So can people like ,  and others here who have a pro-biopsychosocial stance categorically state that they are not being paid by the disability insurance industry, and are not receiving any form of benefit from this or any other industry or outside interests? There are several people who are persistent editors on this ME/CFS page, who work hard and tirelessly to make ME/CFS look as if it were a biopsychosocial illness.\nWikipedia does have many editors who are paid by corporate interests to manipulate articles; see here for example: Some People Get Paid a Lot of Money to Edit Wikipedia Pages. Wikipedia rules state that paid editors who receive compensation for their contributions to Wikipedia, either directly or indirectly, MUST disclose who is paying them to edit. So that is why I am asking the editors of this page who have a pro-biopsychosocial view of ME/CFS and a major interest in this article to declare whether or not they receive any form of payment, benefit or compensation for their work on this article.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by    \nAspro: @46.208.234.40  Er uh humm.... Don't think Doc James,is paid by the disability insurance industry in anyway or form. He appears to come across as a very genuine and   knowable medic (which takes many years of study and ''hands-on-experience'' to get to that level of expertise). Problem is that on CFS he often appears  comes across as a shoemaker that doesn't keep to his last and pontificates in area which he has little understanding. Think this is the real issue... For being an expert in one range of areas doesn't qualify one to be and expert  in everything. As for Sciencewatcher, she comes across as  only interested in the ''it is all in the mind'' explanations. In the past, this view was very popular – but has fallen (''by much  earlier than present 2017'') to the wayside of wishful thinking without any science coming forth to back it up. Therefore, we should not pay these brief bright, brilliant and ''flash-in-the-pan'' ideas any credence  no more.

I can give full citations, but this is not a substantial change.  Check the diff version to see exactly what I have done.  There is still the problem that we are defining the subject by its branches. This is bad in principle, and bad in the case of philosophy, where there is no complete agreement about what the branches are.  But one step at a time.  It is quite amazing to see this article with only 2 edits in an 8 hour period.  Best.  \nPeter Damian (original account):  Let me give two different quotations from that page, to illustrate my point.  The first is by Maritain: \"Philosophy is the science by which the natural light of reason studies the first causes or highest principles of all things – is, in other words, the science of things in their first causes, in so far as these belong to the natural order.\"  That is an attempt at a definition, which is half Aristotle (the first causes) and half Aquinas (the natural light of reason).  It would be controversial now, but there is no doubt it aims to be a definition.  By contrast Russell says \"The point of philosophy is to start with something so simple as to seem not worth stating, and to end with something so paradoxical that no one will believe it.\"  Which is not a definition but a witty, and half ironic remark about a certain kind of philosophy.   The page in question ( definitions of philosophy) mixes these two kinds of statement about philosophy in roughly equal proportion.   \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack?  \n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either \"True\" or \"False\" with without using any other words.\n",

    "373": "E. Ripley: Okay, just to refocus things a bit.  Let's concentrate on the disagreements in the first paragraph.  I've cleaned it up removing refs etc. for readability.  The anon is seeking to have the first paragraph say:  ''Plus-size model is a term applied to a person who is engaged primarily in modeling garments that are designed specifically for fat or overweight people.''\n3RingCircus would prefer an opening paragraph that says this:  ''Plus-size model is a term applied to a person who is engaged primarily in modeling clothing offered in large or extended sizes (see plus-sized clothing). Females working as plus-size models range from U.S. size 8 and upwards, and are also engaged in work that is not strictly related to selling large-sized clothing, i.e. body acceptance commentary, stock photography, and advertising photography for cosmetics, household and pharmaceutical products, sunglasses, footwear and watches, etc. Therefore plus-size models do not exclusively wear garments marketed as plus-size clothing. This is especially true when participating in fashion editorials for mainstream fashion magazines.''\nThe two first sentences really convey the same thing.  Plus-size models primarily model plus-size garments.  Then 3ring goes on to describe what size plus-size models typically are, and expands on the idea that they do not only model plus-sized clothing, but rather items such as watches and the like.  (I would go even farther, and point out that people who model plus-sized clothing often are not really plus-sized themselves, but let's not muddy the water).  I think the first sentence we largely have agreement on, save some minor wording issues.  The question really is whether or not to include the rest that 3ring wants.  Anon, can you tell me why you dislike the rest of what 3ring wants to include in the opener?  It doesn't really seem unreasonable to me generally speaking, but maybe I'm missing some nuance.  — \\\n3RingCircus: E.Ripley, it would seem I have to be very specific here.  I realize that my posts and work-it-out-in-writing thought process make it dificult to follow my intent, so to summarize and be really clear (and please excuse my lack of knowledge on blockquoting and proper layout).\nPrior to the edit war with Anon/IP:79.97.166.36, the opening sentence of the article was as follows:'' '''Plus-size model''' is a term internationally applied to a woman who is engaged primarily in modeling garments that are designed and marketed specifically for larger body sizes and types (see plus-size clothing)''.  This article's editors had previously (see: [Section 6, para 4/5/6]) reached a consensus regarding the wording of the first sentence with particular regards to mention of plus-size clothing, i.e. that it be as unspecific as practical, if mention be made at all.\nAnonymous User/IP 79.97.166.36 edited this statement to read: ''Plus-size model is a term applied to a person who is engaged primarily in modeling garments that are designed specifically for fat or overweight people[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] (see plus-size clothing).'' and reverted it a number of times to this wording after editors altered it on the basis that 'fat or overweight' was pejorative or not accurately describing who wears plus size clothing.   After I raised discussion on whether the phrase \"fat or overweight\" was pejorative, User 24.215.23.237 wrote in Section 32 on 4Sept09 that  ''79.97.166.36 is being selective in his definitions. The full OED has two different defintions, one for \"plus size,\" one for \"plus-sized\". They are as follows:\nplus size n. and adj. orig. U.S. (a) n. a large size of clothing; (b) adj. (usu. with hyphen) = plus-sized adj.\nplus-sized adj. orig. U.S. (of clothing) sized to fit an overweight or fat person, usually a woman; euphem. (of a person, usually a woman) overweight; fat.  Since we are being very particular here, this article is titled \"plus-size model,\" therefore there is no reason not to use the first definition.  Also, a useful fix to this controversy is '''not to speculate as to the persons for whom plus-size clothing is marketed'''. (After all, even male transvestites purchase plus-size female clothing, and they may not be fat or overweight at all, simply large due to their gender.)  '''Therefore, to sat (sic) that a plus-size model is engaged in \"modelling large sizes of clothing\" is the most accurate statement that one can make, fits with the OED definition, and does not engage in questionable and unnecessary speculation as to the identity of the individuals who purchase the products'''. 24.215.23.237 (talk) ''\nI thought this statement was a logical and sound interpretation of the OED and its best applicability to the article, so I agreed with User 24.215.23.237 as to the irrelevance of Anon's edits, and made the following comment: \"''... the size range of agency career models (i.e. not internet glamour or 'hobby' models) completely separates them from the sizing of plus-sized clothing and therefore there should be no more confusing discussion of plus-size clothing nor who that clothing is made for.'' \" 3RingCircus 124.184.249.159 (talk) .  Although in retrospect my comment reads a little heavyhanded and 'pronouncement-like', I felt that a consensus on the matter was reached between editors of the article both now and previously, as it was directly in-line with consensus reached as described above in Section 6, and so I adjusted the article accordingly.  Shortly thereafter, Anon/User 79.97.166.36 reverted the opening sentence to their original edit, as they have continually done since their first edit to this article.\nTo date: Anon/User 79.97.166.36 blatantly disregards prior consensus reached, reverts with no regard for other editors' work, and has received no consensus relating to their edits.  Whenever this matter of clothing sizes comes up, even if it is discussed differently and among different editors, the same consensus is reached - that mention of specifics be avoided, as it has its own article for such business. I remind Anon/User 79.97.166.36 that consensus is a fundamental policy for Wiki editors.  Not one single person has agreed with Anon that this sentence, \"Plus-size model is a term applied to a person who is engaged primarily in modeling garments that are designed specifically for fat or overweight people[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] (see plus-size clothing)\" should remain as it stands on this article, or at plus-size clothing where it better fits.\nE.Ripley, I request only that the original opening sentence'' '''Plus-size model''' is a term internationally applied to a woman who is engaged primarily in modeling garments that are designed and marketed specifically for larger body sizes and types (see plus-size clothing)'' be reinserted (sentences following can remain as updated), and that Anon/User 79.97.166.36 be cautioned to stop editing against consensus.   \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack?  \n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either \"True\" or \"False\" with without using any other words.\n",

    "392": "Miketwo:  Revert War \nMiketwo: '''I removed the following section'''\nThe term '''agnosticism''' and the related '''agnostic''' were coined by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1869. As Huxley explains it, agnosticism is not about '''''knowledge''''' at all, because nobody can convince the world that he knows there is a god without producing logically satisfactory evidence of a god; agnostics are simply those who deny and repudiate any doctrine that there are propositions people ought to '''''believe''''' without logically satisfactory evidence .\nThis is one of the main issuses that still remain concerning agnosticism. The issue is whether there is anything distinctive in being agnostic. When it comes right down to the facts of the matter theists in general do not generally say that they know that a god exists, only that they believe there might be one, and atheists in general do not say they know there is no god, only that they do not believe there might be one. And, as Huxley points out in \"Agnosticism and Christianity\" , agnosticism, in essence, is not really about knowledge at all, since nobody knows, it is about the denial and repudiation of  any doctrine that there are propositions people ought to believe without logically satisfactory evidence.\nI removed it because:\n Radically changing the main definition of an article 2+ years in the making is too bold.  The previous definition has been forged of many arguments, and is pretty good at addressing the various interest groups' issues.\n Even that aside, the new section is badly written.

The use of no less than 6 commas in the last \"sentence\" is also pretty bad.

    "397": "DRR75:  The film is authentic \nDRR75: I do understand that the Patterson-Gimlin film is still in dispute to this day.  I saw a Bigfoot back in June of 1991 and that kind of opened the door to me to the whole Bigfoot phenomena.  When I was a small child I saw the film and was scared of it.  After my sighting I watched the Patterson-Gimlin film several dozen times and I concluded Bigfoot I saw that day in 1991 looked VERY CLOSE to the creature in the Patterson-Gimlin film.  The creature in the film was just under 7' and was a female due to the fact that it had breasts.  The one I saw was about 8' and a male I believe.  In the last few years the film has undergone digital analysis and examination and those that did the analysis COULD NOT determine that the film was faked.  Bigfoot researcher John Green back in 1967 shortly after the film was made went back to the site and filmed a stand-in model-Jim McClarin- walking the same path that the creature took as a reference to determine the height and weight of the creature in the film.  The two films were superimposed to show the difference between the two.  McClarin stood 6'.5\".  The creature in the film was taller and much more bulkier.  The arms on the creature are longer than a normal man's arms.  I recently viewed the film digitally enhanced at a meeting of the International Bigfoot Society.  I could see the muscles moving underneath the hair of the creature.  The creature walks with an unusual bent-knee gait that is almost impossible to imitate.  The late Dr. Grover Krantz tried once to imitate it but was unsuccessful.  Several anatomists have recently discovered some sort of injury on the creature's knee as it flexes its knee when it's walking.  I can see no seams on the creature that would indicate a costume.  Apes have a natural hair seam running down the length of their spines.  As to the feet in the film- the area that the creature walked in the film was on sand and very soft soil which stuck to the creature's feet, as it would to any animal or human for that matter that would be walking in soil like that with bare feet.  When the creature turns to look at the camera, it just doesn't move its head- it moves its entire upper torso in the direction of the cameraman- just as an ape would do.  The creature turned to look at the camera because Bob Gimlin had crossed the creek and trained his rifle on it after Patterson told him to cover him in case the creature was agressive.  That's why the creature turned to look at the camera.  If this creature was a man in a costume, why would he risk his life with Gimlin having a loaded rifle aimed at him?  That doesn't make sense.  Patterson ran out of film because the rest of the film in his camera had been used filming scenery for a documentary he wanted to do.  Before he could change the film in his rented camera the creature had disappeared into the woods.  Patterson and Gimlin did trail it but couldn't go any further because the creature's trail went into the mountains and they couldn't follow with their horses and they weren't logistically equipped to go up the mountain after the creature.  The film is shaky because Patterson was running after the creature while he was filming it and finally stabilized himself on a tree stump.  Patterson did not know anything about cameras or film speeds.  I have personally met Bob Gimlin and heard what he had to say about what Patterson filmed that day.  He sticks to his story that what he saw that day was a flesh and blood creature and not some guy in a fur suit.  Gimlin never made any money whatsoever on the film.  I am not trying to say that what everyone else believes is wrong; I'm just saying what I know about the film and I believe it to be authentic.  This was suppossed to have been faked by an ex-rodeo cowboy?

It occurred during the military operations of the Allied forces and after the withdrawal of the German units from the region. It was carried out by the Allies through elements of the Resistance National Republican Greek League (EDES) forces with the acquiescence of local British intelligence operatives.

After the members of the community settled in Albania, instead of being treated as victims and have their rights protected, the local regime took a very distrustful view towards them and proceeded with arrests and exiles.

Marcuse adhered to the views of the young Marx who felt that capitalist social relations alienated humans from expressions of their \"species-being\", views for which you show some affinity in your \"Notes on Anarchism\" essay.\nNC: I don't know of any substantive theories of ideology.  The ideas of the early Marx on alienation are pretty much drawn from the Enlightenment-Romantic intellectual environment of his day, often in very similar words.  I think these notions have a lot of value, and have written about them, in the essay you mention and elsewhere.\nQ: For Marcuse, capitalism engendered \"false\" consciousness and \"false\" needs in the sense that they are unnatural. Do you agree with this line of argument?\nNC: Putting aside Marcuse's contributions, there is a rich literature about the ways in which market systems and \"created wants\" were imposed, often by violence, on the general population, which bitterly resisted them, and still does.  Meanwhile the masters devised numerous ways to protect themselves from the destructive impact of the systems they were imposing on others.  That's a good part of the history of the past several centuries.  What is \"natural\" depends on unknown facts about human nature.  We do, however, know a lot about the resistance to the doctrines and institutions imposed by force.  I don't know what line of argument there is beyond this.\nQ: Finally critics seem to think that people who hold this position must be automatically and inevitably elitist. Implying that your views mean that \"the masses have been so manipulated that they have neither the perspective or intellect to see beyond the propaganda and require superior intellects like Chomsky's to point out to them the real truth.\" How would you respond to such a charge?\nNC: Since I've consistently and extensively written precisely the opposite, and detailed the reasons and the record at length, the charge can only come from someone so irrational and blinded by ideological fanaticism that they cannot read simple sentences.  There is therefore no reason to respond. \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack?  \n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either \"True\" or \"False\" with without using any other words.\n",

Although everything in that paragraph is backed by published sources, it is written as though the position of the plaintiffs in the Massachusetts lawsuit is the only one that is morally defensible.  Furthermore, the sentence mentioning that Wal-Mart still maintains its conscientious objection policy is written in a tone that seems to suggest that the conscientious objection policy has little or no support from outside of Wal-Mart management (when in fact the contrary is true), or that this policy is socially irresponsible (without due weight to opposing or alternative viewpoints).  \nDerek.cashman: I still don't see the POV in that particular section, but I think it can be cleaned up a bit, so the tone has been changed a little to reflect that.

    "469": "Egil: There is already a section on history, and much of the content here seems to be not so relevant. More importantly, much of it seems to be original research by the author. The \"Greek Milos\" for instance, exists only in Wikipedia. Not good at all. Im fact, I really have not found any documentation of any of these claims.  \n\nThe Greeks derived their systemized standards of measure from a variety of sources including ancient Europe, Mesopotamia, Persia, Phoenicia and Egypt.\nThe credit for the first systemized collection and standardization probably goes to the empire builders of Mesopotamia and Egypt but the international commerce of the people who benefited by those great empires, the Greeks and Persians and the Romans who followed them is what really required the system be standardized over such vast areas.\nThe Mesopotamians measured their arable land in garden plots or sar and combined them into fields or ''iku'' of 100 cubits to a side. The Egyptians measured out the irrigation ditches that bounded their ''3ht'' or fields as strips a cubit wide and 100 cubits long known as ''kht''. Their ''st3t'' which was a field 100 cubits to a side became the Greek Aroura.\nIt is probable that farmers measured out the land their community allowed them to plow in return for digging the ditch by pacing it off and built up an enclosure for it with the stones they found in their furrows.\nThe community would give the fields out in pairs, one to be plowed and one to remain fallow which were planted in rotation. As beasts of burden were domesticated and yoked to the plow the amount of land under cultivation increased, and a third field was added to be planted in hay or fodder for the plow animal. The side of this cluster of fields became standardized at 350 cubits or one minute of march.\nThe Milos was based on a stadion equivalent to the Egyptian minute of march.\nIn Egypt the minute of march was 350 royal cubits long and an hour of march or ''itrw'' was 21,000 royal cubits long. The Greeks tell us they noted their measures of 6 plethrons and 8 stadions, were both the equivalent of the Apothem or slant side of the Great Pyramid.\nUsing unit measures like the Stadion, Stadium and Furlong which were originally used to lay out fields and only gradually became defined as areas like the Aroura or thousand square royal cubits, the empire builders measured out their roads.\nThe Greek Milos was originally 8 stadions or 600 Greek pous × 8 = 4800 pous. The Pous came in long, short, and median variations so depending on which one you used the number of pous would vary even as the length of the stadion and Milos remained the same. 600 Attic pous were equal to 625 Ionian pous but both stadions were 185 meters long.\nThe Romans standard ''pes'' was the Ionian pous of 296 mm so they made their stadium of 185 meters equal to 625 pes or 1000 passus and that made their Milliare 5000 pes.\nWhat makes that a great system for empire builders is that the passus is now a measure of the pace at which the army moves. If such standards of measure are well suited to controlling the movements of armies with milestones related to how much distance can be covered in a set period of time they are equally servicable to the needs of commerce.\nJust as the farmer can use the stone walls that border his field to help him restablish its boundaries after a flood, the community can establish its bounds in terms of how much land it needs to irrigate to sustain its population and the ''lugal'' or ''narmr'' (chief farmer) can determine how many men he needs to dig the irrigation system and how much land to alot to each ''oinkos'', ''gene'' and ''phratre'' in return for their service. It's all very feudal.\nThe city state is based on a market or agora that serves a number of communities which are spaced about as far apart as a man can walk in a day driving a team of oxen pulling a cart.\nGene Nygaard: I agree that this is largely incomprehensible and mostly irrelevant to this article.

Editor  deleted an entire section [] from Thimerosal and substituted it on this page.\nWhat a curious description of '''moving''' the section..  And curious of course means POV.\nThe Thiomersal article was left quite a nice article about a chemical, with a link to the material here - which has a body of agrement on teh talk page there - where I suggested the move.  Nothing is lost, and this arrangement is at least as good as at least two others.  I think the material beliongs together, and I think teh good faith of this anonymous editor User:86.10.231.219 is not something one should assume, in this topic.  \nThe section about the thimerosal debate has nothing to do with anti-vaccinationists.  The thimerosal issue is about banning the use of a neurotoxin (mercury in the form of thimerosal) in vaccines.  It is not about banning the use of the vaccines nor is it a crusade of principle but about preventing harm to infants by eliminating the neurotoxin and not about eliminating the vaccines.\nThere is a substnatial overlap in people and in arguments.  That is a large connection.  Lets see what other people think.  Persuading Leiffen (who has a reputation for acting abruptly when some people might look to see what had been discussed and assess whether other people's opinions might have validity to revert it was not actually an action I would suggest indicates you respect him.  (one of Eric Bernes' games people play.)\nThis example also demonstrates the POV nature of the definition.  The editor has been unable to cite any source for the definition [].  It appears the editor's own creation designed to include any criticism of any kind of any vaccine's safety.  This applies even to criticisms or critics irrelevant to the editor's postulated \"anti-vaccinationist\" movement. \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack?  \n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either \"True\" or \"False\" with without using any other words.\n",

Largest Serbian diaspora lives in Usa and Germany, this is why we need a higher estimation for the U.S. where undoubtebly live atleast up to 1 million ppl of Serbian origin.

Today number of people with Norwegian ancestry is ~5 million! How many ppl of Serbian origin then... I find these sources okay and if neccesary you can input even a figure from Tim Judah`s book.

While it is a very new idea (in its modern, repulsive form), the observational evidence for it is sufficiently compelling that most working cosmologists now accept it as part of the standard model of the universe (the so-called \"Concordance Cosmology\").  I've rewritten the dark energy section (which seemed to be deeply confused between dark energy and dark matter, another now-standard idea) but I'm not sure it should be here at all.   \nIonized: I don't know why it is here either.  But I didn't want to remove it myself as I had already revamped the rest of the article, and just kind of stopped.  It seems to me that the whole 'dark' scenario has indeed been taken up by the standard, and is not a key ingredient in the usual non-standard models, hence should be removed from the non-standard page.  Now that you have re-written the section, it seems better, but it should still be clarified as to why it is included in the article.  If by chance it was somehow there to lend discredit to the standard, it should be removed. - \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack?  \n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either \"True\" or \"False\" with without using any other words.\n",
