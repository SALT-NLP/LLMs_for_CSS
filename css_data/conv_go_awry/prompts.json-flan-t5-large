They were a formidable people and Justinian had long ago taken precautions to keep them in check, in case they should threaten to attack the Empire, though it was probably for the Roman cities of the Crimea, Cherson and Bosporus, that he feared, rather than for the Danubian provinces. As his policy on the Danube was to use the Lombards as a check on the Gepids, so his policy in Scythia was to use another Hunnic people, the Utigurs, as a check on the Kotrigurs.

The Huns and Proto-Bulgarians spoke the same language, different from all other \"barbarian\" languages. When Turkic tribes appeared at the borders of the Chinese empire in the 6th c., the Huns and Proto-Bulgarians were no longer there. It is important to note that Turkic does contain Hunno-Bulgarian loans, but that these were received through Chinese intermediary, e.g. Hunnic ch’eng-li ‘sky, heaven’ was borrowed from Chinese as tängri in Turkic. The Hunno-Bulgarian language exhibits non-Turkic and non-Altaic features. Altaic has no initial consonant clusters, while Hunno-Bulgarian does. Unlike Turkic and Mongolian, Hunno-Bulgarian language has no initial dental or velar spirants. Unlike Turkic, it has initial voiced b-: bagatur (a title), boyla (a title). Unlike Turkic, Hunno-Bulgarian has initial n-, which is also encountered in Mongolian: Negun, Nebul (proper names).

The king referred by Procopius is most probably Ernak, the third son of Attila. After the death of the king, the two sons divided the people into two tribes. Analyzing the chronicles of the antique historians Vasil Zlatarski concludes that the name Bulgar was used for both tribes, but in  6th century the tribal names were preferred by the Eastern Roman Empire due to the different policy it had toward these two tribes.Васил Н. Златарски\nИстория на Първото българско Царство, page 75 In the middle of 6th century the Emperor Justinian, being attacked by the Kutrigurs under their leader Chinialus, bribed their relatives the Utigurs led by Sandilch to attacked the Kutrigurs in the rear. The resulting internecine war between the two tribes weakened them and made them vulnerable to the Avar attack shortly after that.The Huns, Rome and the Birth of Europe, Hyun Jin Kim,page 142, https://books.google.bg/books?id=jCpncXFzoFgC&pg;=PA132&dq;=Utigur+attila&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0CB8Q6AEwAGoVChMIs9-UmKyQxwIVBKJyCh0V0wQM#v=onepage&q;=Sandilch%20&f;=false\nBy 568CE some Kutrigurs groups came under the control of the Varchonites who were migrating to Pannonia and was also known as Avars. The eastern Bulgar groups along the northern coasts of the Black sea, the Utigurs, were conquered by the Western Turkic Kaghanate (who were violently opposed to the Pannonian Avars). Due to civil war the Western Turks retreated back into Asia no later than 583 CE according to Zlatarski.\nKubrat's Utigurs defeated the Avars in alliance with Byzantium and reunited the Utigurs and Kutrigurs into a single Crimean Bulgar confederation in Patria Onoguria renamed as \"Old Great Bulgaria\"\nAfter Kubrat's death in 665AD, his empire was dividedRunciman, Book I, The Children of the Huns, page 16-17 when his appointed heir Batbayan submitted to the Khazars of Kubrat's second son Kotrag who settled Batbayan's army at the confluence of the Volga and Kama rivers where they founded a Khanate known as Volga Bulgaria.Heritage of Scribes: The Relation of Rovas Scripts to Eurasian Writing Systems, Gábor Hosszú, Rovas Foundation, 2012, ISBN 9638843748, p. 287.\nOther sons of Kubrat carried the Utigur name to the Danube and Pannonia Secunda by April 677.

Following the Battle of Ongal, Asparukh settled a portion of the Utigur Bulgars in Moesia, to establish the state which would become modern Bulgaria. In the 8th century, the Kuber Bulgars merged with Asparuh's Bulgars who had by the late 7th century already taken both sides of the Danube River. \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack? \nTrue\nFalse\n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either True or False with without using any other words.\n",

    "28": "Philkon:  What level of \"Proof\" are various editors looking for? In my case, I knew my long deceased grandfather was on the Dawes Rolls taken of the Cherokee in the early 1900s. However, it took almost 40 years (no exaggeration) to find enough \"proof\" to meet BIA standards to get a Certified Degree of Indian Blood (CDIB) card. After that, getting Cherokee Nation citizenship was easy.\nYears ago, I recall the State of California telling me I could not claim to be of Cherokee ancestry on official forms because I was not a citizen at the time. That was extremely frustrating. Five years later when I was a citizen, the state no longer had that section on their forms.\nI can see omitting people who have made a claim of ancestry, but documentation shows they are not. I have come across many people who \"feel\" they are American Indian, but have no specific details.\nPerhaps the editors who wish to delete some questionable people could contact those people directly to see if they want to be on the list; and if so, could they provide some proof of their claim or the basis of their claim. Then the editors could at least have something to go on.\nFYI, while the Cherokee Nation has approximately 300,000 enrolled citizens, over 750,000 people self-claimed Cherokee ancestry during the most recent census. Many people are familiar with the part of Cherokee history called the Trail of Tears which moved the Cherokees to Indian Territory (Oklahoma) in the 1830s. However, many Cherokees left our ancestral lands decades before the removal. Many settled in what now is Arkansas and Missouri. After the \"Trail,\" The US government took numerous rolls of tribal members. If you did not live in the \"official\" Cherokee lands in Indian Territory, you were not included in those rolls. All of those Cherokees in Arkansas and Missouri (just to name a few, others went to Mexico/Texas, etc.) were not included in most rolls. Presently, the Cherokee Nation's primary requirement to become a citizen is being able to trace your blood ancestry back to anyone listed as Cherokee on the Dawes rolls. It does not matter what your blood-quantum is, just verifiable Cherokee blood. So, if your full-blooded Cherokee grandfather and your full-blooded Cherokee grandmother were not on the rolls, you will not be able to become a citizen of the Cherokee Nation, even if you are full-blooded Cherokee.\nThis all just goes to show that \"proof\" can be hard to come by, and varies from person to person.\nFor disclosure purposes, I am on the list of people being discussed here. Phil Konstantin\nVizjim:  Hi Phil - Great summary of the situation.  In short, this list has been deliberately created so as not to have Wikipedian editors going out and doing genealogical research.  You'll find non-citizen Cherokee writers on this list including Diane Glancy, Kim Shuck, Robert J. Conley and others: I think all three of these are in exactly the situation you describe.  Rather than looking for \"proof,\" the list was set up to accept people's word for their ancestry unless there have been credible proofs by third parties that the claim to indigenous ancestry is incorrect. \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack? \nTrue\nFalse\n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either True or False with without using any other words.\n",

    "33": "Splash: Not to start off by citing policy, but I read this and felt that dull thud of wiki_link as I got to the end of the article. I realise, accept and understand that 'credit crunch' is a much-used term over recent months, much as is its counterpart (?) 'wiki_link'. However, I observe that both articles were created circa mid- to late- 2007 ie. in recent months. Taking this article, it has the approach of a theoretical treatise on what a 'credit crunch' is and why one may occur. It does not back this up to an acceptable degree with academic or other economically-authoritative sources. The best it's got is an FT article. This is because there are no text books, no journal papers, no lecture notes or anything of that sort available to help write an encyclopedic article at present. It is an original synthesis of observed effects in the media, a couple of which have citation to newspaper stories. Things like diagnosing that they often follow a period of loose credit is to reverse engineer the current situation to produce a novel, if predictable, notion. There are other examples, too. This kind of original synthesis is exactly what wiki_link forbids, unfortunately. I see two routes out of the conundrum of wanting an article on ''the'' credit crunch whilst trying to write about ' ''all'' ' credit-crunches (of which I speculate there have been no other events so named): Somebody proves me comprehensively wrong and finds authoritative, academic, or otherwise peer-reviewed sources we can cite in this tertiary source. (My preferred route). This is rewritten to discuss the proceedings of the present financial turmoil, and is mercilessly stripped of the imputations, interpolations and extrapolations it currently possesses. This will probably result in merging/redirection with/to wiki_link, but might not since its scope is gradually widening to be more than just a subprime-related issue. Along the way, I'd think the same problems lurk in wiki_link and wiki_link, both begun around the same time as this article.  - \n165.228.245.66: No, it's not original research.

Instead, try to ''change'' the text to something that you like better.  Try to seek a compromise.\n If one editor adds something, and another editor removes it, the first editor should not add it back, unless they are ''also'' including a source which allows verification of the information.\n Instead of trying to make the article \"one way or the other\", try to see if there is a way to find a compromise.  Per Wikipedia's neutrality policy, this will probably lend to a stronger article which is a better resource for our readers.\n If the above suggestions do not help to stabilize things, please request opinions from other editors.

Just make sure you stick to excellent sources (no websites of uncertain origin), source every edit, make sure the sources are writing about Cannistraro specifically, and don't elaborate on what they say.

    "155": "Xkcdreader:  Into is a compound preposition.The Title makes sense as a sentence fragment, because Star is an adjective. \nXkcdreader: First off, I edited a section it asked me not to, and I apologize. I ctrl+f'd to my name to reply to someone and didn't see the warning. Super sorry. Anyway..\nThe MOS explicitly says \"The first word in a compound preposition\" should be capitalized.  Linguistics lesson time.  Into is a compound of the prepositions In and to.  http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/594/02/ Compound_preposition If the space was not removed through reduction the tile would read 'Star Trek In to Darkness'.  If a compound becomes one word, it would represent \"the first word in a compound.\"  The guideline was plain as day, yet casually ignored by those fighting for strict adherence to the lower case guideline.  The most literal, strict, and  pedantic interpretation of MOS (which I don't advocate anyway, for it is just a guideline) demands that Into be capitalized.  There was no written exception for single word compound prepositions.  Into is a specific type of compound, called a copulative similar to words bittersweet and sleepwalk.  FURTHERMORE, into is a very special type of preposition called a directional spatial adpositions.  '''Directional spatial adpositions can only combine with verbs that involve motion.''' Onward and Upward Onto point two.\nI want to take a second to address the \"it cant be a sentence because stars can't take treks\" argument, because I think it is wrong.  When into is used in a sentence, Into modifies the word Trek as trek is the verb.  Remember, directional spatial adpositions can only combine with verbs that involve motion.  'Trek Into' becomes the verb phrase and then 'Trek Into Darkness' becomes the noun phrase because it describes a specific event (such as the Civil War.)  Star becomes an adjective.  Everyone arguing the sentence doesn't make sense is arguing that Star can only be used as a noun.  But in a sentence Star is parsed as an adjective.  We have a Trek Into Darkness.  What type of Trek is it?  A Star type Trek.  It is a Trek (Into Darkness) that pertains to Stars.  (See definition 17 of star in this dictionary http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/star)\nThey have purposely used the phrase in a way which is unfamiliar to fans.  To boldly go indeed (yes I know I split the infinitive, it was an allusion.)  Think of Star and Space as synonyms for Futuristic in this use scenario.  Yet, I would argue that Star has always been the adjective and Trek has always been the noun.  The show has always been about a Trek of the Star/Space variety, and never about Stars themselves taking Treks.  The words have been used this way for a long time.  The new title becomes equivalent to Futuristic Trek Into Darkness, or Trek Into Darkness in Space.  Thus, Star Trek Into Darkness can be read as a sentence fragment because Star describes the type of Trek.  The word Star itself has taken on a less common meaning (in Space.)  Star is in the dictionary as this type of adjective, we just don't see it too often outside of the titles Star Trek and Star Wars.  I personally think they did this on purpose to draw attention to the title, and get people talking about it.  In a way it is reminiscent of the title The Empire Strikes Back. \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack? \nTrue\nFalse\n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either True or False with without using any other words.\n",

Inside The Churches of Christ reveals those obstacles as they are manifested throughout modern day Churches of Christ. Author, Charles Simpson, reflects an unmistakable Pharisaical attitude toward other Christians, Christian traditions and Christian institutions typical of those he personally witnessed as a 50-year active member of the Churches of Christ. Dozens of quotes from Church of Christ practitioners from all over the USA validate the legalisms prevalent within this group. Church of Christ readers will come away with a new perspective on the actual theology of their own brethren and the potential impact of that theology on other believers. All Christian readers will have a better view of the non-denomination denomination and gain much insight into the Church of Christ claim of being Christ's 'one true church'\"\n '''The Truth about the Church of Christ''' with a little summary: Dr. Hugh Pyle shares with us that many years ago, '''a strange religious sect’’’ joined the so called \"Christian\" community. Over the years they have gained a notable following of ill-taught people who are being convinced that this is the '''one true church’’’, and that it was actually founded by the Lord Jesus Christ on the day of Pentecost. In order to prove their points of doctrine, they use the most chopped-up portions of mismatched and ill-chosen verses imaginable.

This rules out almost everybody except members of the COC (and some of the NACC churches) as genuine Christians…CRI has received numerous letters from members of the COC, as well as testimonies of non-COC Christians, that confirm the prevalence of this teaching.”\n “The depths of error into which this principle of Restorationism can lead is best illustrated by the fact that the early leaders of the movement were prepared to accept Barton Stone as one of them, despite the fact that he denied the Trinity and the deity of Christ… Indeed, the members of the Restorationist churches are a prime target of the Jehovah’s Witnesses because of their weakness on the Trinity.”\nAny thoughts?  \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack? \nTrue\nFalse\n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either True or False with without using any other words.\n",

Much of the content and the article structure seems to have directly translated to this page.\nBut this is ''English'' Wikipedia. We have to describe terms as they are used in English, not in other languages, since terms seldom, if ever, can be directly translated. There's no harm in mentioning how the terms are viewed in other (relevant) languages, but English usage has to be given precedence. Here are some dictionary definitions of \"Flemish\" from dictionary.com. There are minor variations, but there are only two basic noun definitions; the dialect of Dutch or the Flemish people. As far as English dictionaries go, Flemish doesn't seem to be be any more complicated than Chinese or French. (That they're both national languages isn't relevant, because they still have separate articles.) I'd really like to see some English language sources to support the view that would motivate why Flemish would be the only language/ethnicity term in all of English Wikipedia that can't have a normal disambiguation page.\nI believe verdy p's very territorial remark about not tolerating additions by anyone who isn't working on the French, German or Dutch articles reflects the problem rather well.

That's a legitimate POV, but it isn't the only one. Another POV, for example, is the one that says this gun had an easier trigger pull, and that the frequency of guns being were drawn increased after the department bought them. In other words, that the gun did matter, and that not all guns are the same. That POV is significant, as shown by the large number of gun publications and even gun articles on Wikipedia.

(Well, there is another stop, called StartYourOwnDamnWiki. But hardly anyone goes there. Andyvphil is irritating, but, yes, a short comment period doesn't necessarily establish consensus, but it can certainly show lack of it. There is no consensus at this point for the insertion of *some* of the material proposed, and there is indeed, as Osbojos points out, an increased level of verifiability necessary for controversial claims with the biographies of living persons. But we can't say what tomorrow's consensus will be, no door is closed. \"Edit warring\" to remove controversial material from a BLP, as long as it is at all reasonable, and definitely Ratel's position is within that territory, isn't likely to result in block unless it is clearly contrary to consensus. Edit warring in the other direction is much more likely to be blocked. So, given this, I'd suggest everyone relax. If someone wants to continue to rant and rave and foam at the mouth, well, eventually the dog-catcher will arrive and take him away. Whatever side he's on. The article protection can be extended if needed, and it does not prevent improvement of the article. What we can agree on here can rather easily be incorporated. What is over is the possibility that simply by reverting enough times, one can control the text, at least for part of a day. To Andyvphil, if you want to improve the text from your point of view, there is a clear path: first of all, be civil and polite. I like Bill Moyers, but not enough to support concealing anything verifiable  and balanced  about him. Insulting other editors is not a great idea if you are trying to find consensus with them. Seek consensus, with civility, and you might be able to accomplish something more than just getting yourself blocked.  \nRatel: Right, since Abd feels all editors must agree to obtain consensus (which is clearly not going to happen here), I'll succinctly put my objections to the main remaining issues: 1) the inclusion of the condemnatory words by the Church Committee (CC) and 2) the Deke DeLoach (DD) seating affair.\nThe CC's words related to the actions of ''many'' people over ''many'' years. As far as I know, none of the WP pages relating to these people carry the CC judgements, so why should the Moyers page, unless a POV is getting pushed?\nThe DD affair about convention seating amounts to a relatively ''unknown'' incident that DD ''claims'' happened. Now immediately that raises red flags: we are not supposed to be reporting little known facts on BLP pages, especially so if the fact is derogatory. If you don't know that, you ought to read the rules more carefully. And quite apart from that, the page on Regnery Publishing shows that it is simply a right wing front organisation e.g., the same people who published the Swift Boat smear. Read the Regnery Publishing talk page. Everyone knows that Regnery is one of the major purveyors of books by right-wing attack dogs like Anne Coulter and G. Gordon Liddy. What they choose to publish about one of their greatest enemies, Moyers, is not for inclusion here, when it comes only from one man, Deke Deloach, who only became deputy director of the FBI in 1965 (so he was not \"#3 at the time\"), and who, according to Ronald Kessler in ''The Bureau: The Secret History of the FBI'', once attempted to blackmail Senator Carl T. Hayden. This is not a reliable source.

    "190": "M~enwiki: Maybe someone can explain this one to me. God directly creates lion F and lion M. If you get directly created by God, you have no common ancestry. So both these lions have no common ancestry. So though they're part of the same kind, they're part of differing baramins. So either our lead sentence is wrong, or a test for no-ancestry is not a test for kind and baraminology is misguided. I suspect it's the latter, but perhaps there's an explanation. (If the explanation is that the lions were conjoined, or self-fertilizing (a trait lost immediately to inbreeding), then I too may 'check out'.) \nUngtss:  That's part of the problem.  There's no way to know how many of each \"kind\" were originally created.  Could have been 2.  Could have been 2,000,000.  Of course, UCD has the same ambiguity here  it's not clear whether we're descended from a single individual, or from a single gene pool (e.g. multiple protoorganisms that arose spontaneously under the same conditions).  At this point, all baraminology is trying to do is figure out who's part of the same ancient gene pool, and who's not.  UCD skipped that step, and assumed (without falsifiable experiment) that all organisms on the planet share common descent.  The real project of baraminology is to track descent back to the ''gene pools'' that stepped off the ark.  For example, ostensibly 14 members of the ''feline'' kind would have stepped off, and subsequently interbred.  Were they related?  We can't really know.  But baraminology is trying to find ways to figure out how many of today's species descended from the feline kind's gene pool.    \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack? \nTrue\nFalse\n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either True or False with without using any other words.\n",

I am not saying I think that was inappropriate, but it would be nice if the editor who made the downgrade would leave a brief comment about what about the article did not meet class B criteria, as it would help with improving the article.  \nMann jess: I posted this on my talk page, but I'll copy/paste it here as well.\nWell, here's the B-class criteria. There were a couple things that caught my eye. Primarily, the citations stood out to me. A B-class article needs to be \"suitably referenced\", which generally implies more than 10 citations from 5 authors. The citations should also be more specific; I see the article usually cites one to two references per paragraph, usually at the end. Ideally, refs should specifically refer to the exact page or excerpt which applies to the content, so having the references interspersed ''within'' the paragraphs would often be appropriate. The citations should also be more diverse; The article has 9 paragraphs, 6 of which are cited by ref (2) and (7) alone. Aside from the refs, there are a couple things which could perhaps be improved (or at least looked into). The article is missing supporting materials, a see also section, {{main article}} templates for the sections, internal links for some terms, and so on. Those aren't generally required until GA, but they're worth doing. As a result of some of the sourcing, and due to a bit of the chosen wording, I'm a bit dubious about the neutrality or verifiability of some parts of the article. For instance, the  tag I added to the article earlier was for a sentence which ''appeared'' to be making a point about the \"immorality of Evolution\". A large reason for that is that the sentence uses weasel words (\"many naturalists... In addition, some felt\"). Those sorts of statements really should be attributed. On top of that, the article should provide a summary of current Evolutionary thought, even if only a sentence or two with links to the appropriate articles. Looking the article over again, it now seems to me that it was written with the intent of being neutral, but doesn't give a balanced overview of the topic, purely by omission. Anyway, I have to run now... but if I have the time later, I might even look into these issues on my own.

He does however know certain things which parecon, like many other alteratives to the market deny, will not work.  He knows hoe they conflate, misrepresent, deny certain aspects of the market.  For example, this idea that comittees can decide what to produce, how much to produce, and who gets what is produced more effeciently than the market is NOT new to parecon.  Friedman, and many others, deal with this with some frequency and explain how the market is best at distributing goods and services and how it is better able to deliver the most diverse set of resources while alternatives, such as the one discribed here, only provide what the majority (or those in power) want.\nTake for example the auto market.  Under the market economy we have cars like the MR-2 Spyder.  An inexpensive sports convertable that only sees a production of less than 20,000 worldwide.  Toyota is also barely profitable at making it.  In comparison with their Camry which they produce millions of the MR2 is nothing...yet it is still produced.  Alternatives such as the parecon, WILL NOT produce a MR2 because the minority who desires a rear wheel drive rear engine, light, quicky, spartan, sporty, cheap convertable is significantly small to NOT be noticed by some voting board.  The market, thanks to the information contained in prices picks up on their wants, and the good is produced.\nFriedman deals  with this extensivly.  parecon is half baked and not original.  he does not have to deal with these alternatives one on one.

On the other issue, it is quite common for non-linguists, especially linguistically unsophisticated people involved in literature or creative writing, to describe languages in non-linguistic terms such as \"musical\", \"rough\", \"harsh\", \"sweet\", etc.  Indeed, one can choose virtually any English adjective and find it applied to some language or other.  But there is no linguistically based definition of any of these common, unscientific terms so they have no place in Wikipedia.  Wikipedia's language articles are based on science, not upon the flights of fancy of creative writers or pushers of some nationalistic agenda.  Yes, it's possible to find unscientific sources that use such terms, but there is no scientific definition of any of these and linguists simply do not use them.  One can choose virtually any English adjective and find some writer who knows nothing of linguistics using it to describe some one or more of the world's languages.

Remember that a reliable source in one context is not necessarily a reliable source in another context.   \nTaivoLinguist: Nagarjuna, instead of getting drones to do your dirty work for you, just prove here that \"musical\" has a linguistic definition used by real linguists, such as world-renowned Telugu and Dravidian specialist B.

But short of a precise linguistic definition for \"musical\", that is used by linguists in reliable scientific sources, you don't have an argument for including that impressionistic, nationalistic drivel here in Wikipedia.  German has been called \"harsh\", the Native American languages have been called \"savage grunts\", the languages of Australia have been likened to bird calls.  But none of these are appropriate scientific descriptions in Wikipedia.  Calling Telugu \"musical\" falls into precisely the same category of non-scientific hyperbole.  The references you use for these comments are not even ''linguistic''.  They are 19th century travelogues and political essays!!!

This action cannot not be viewed as a indecent anti-soviet action, whose goal is to turn away from the truth regarding the collectivisation of village farms in the USSR, to promote hatred to the USSR and the Soviet people.

Such activities attacking the USSR from the official government  in association with activists of the right-extremist centres in Canada, including the union of War criminals of the so-called \"Ukrainian Insurgent Army\", the SS division \"Galizien\" and others cannot be supported. Attention is brought to the anti-Soviet manifestation  in Toronto on May 29 this year regarding the so-called \"Famine in Ukraine\", which amongst its organizers was one of the  leaders of the pro-fascist \"League of Freedom for Ukraine\" V.

Sokolsky and the participation of members of the federal and provincial parliaments.\nWhatever formal excuses these former hitlerite cronies use to hide under under, the to mask their anti-Soviet actions in Canada, the patronage of the government officials makes a mockery of the millions of Soviet  people, who became victims of German Fascism in the years of the Second World War.\nThe Embassy voices its protest against anti-Soviet for that reason of the erection of the above mentioned monument. It expects that actions will be taken in the prohibition of its construction.\nThe Embassy uses this occassion to remind the Ministry in its high and important regard.\n6 copies\n5 July 1983\n1,2 - to addresses\n3. - filed\n4. 2EO\n5 - Central Committee of Communist party of Ukraine\n6. - Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ukr.

No one should consider this a shot at Nintendo. None of these consoles are massive updates hardware-wise and all come very soon after their predecessors. That said - I agree that the whole concept of generations is hard to keep up. It's not something that a definitive source ever decided on. The public at large just kind of accepts that we're in a new generation, then the gaming media drops phrases like \"8th generation consoles are here!\" in all their stories, then we report it here. This was easy in a time when there was all the major manufacturers would release consoles at around the same time, they'd coexist for several years, then they'd release brand new consoles again at the same time. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like it's going to work this way anymore. We could be wrong. We could just be seeing a one-time correction by Sony and Microsoft to take advantage of 4k technology that wasn't mature when these systems were originally released, fortuitously timed with Nintendo needing to release a system early because of the Wii U's abject failure.\nI strongly disagree with the editor above who said we could wait several months before making this decision. That's only going to cause more problems. These discussions aren't going to go away, and other editors are going to constantly update the article to suggest 8th or 9th gen without consulting this talk page. It's just going to cause more churn. I'm not saying we have to make a decision right away, but discussion needs to continue. We can't just ignore the problem.  \nDissident93:  Is this even a real problem, though? All this debate about something that only matters for one part of the infobox, and isn't relevant much elsewhere.

There is one very small difference between the natural numbers and whole numbers.  Natural numbers are defined as your counting numbers, i.e. 1, 2, 3, and so on.  Whole numbers are all of the natural numbers with the inclusion of zero.  So whole numbers have zero, natural numbers do not.

    "256": "46.208.234.40: As is well known in the ME/CFS world, it is greatly in the interests of the disability insurance industry to make ME/CFS look as if it were an \"all in the mind\" disorder caused by psychogenic or biopsychosocial factors, rather than a disease with organic biological causes. This is because disability insurance rules generally stipulate that disability due to biological disease is covered for lifelong disability support payments where necessary, but disability due to mental health disorders are not covered for lifelong support. Thus the insurance industry can save billions in disability payouts if they make it appear that ME/CFS is an \"all in the mind\" mental disorder, rather than the organic biologically-caused disease that most scientific biomedical researchers view it to be. Indeed, the psychiatrists who have most promoted the idea that ME/CFS is an \"all in the mind\"  biopsychosocial condition — people like Simon Wessely, and Prof Peter White — have been paid by disability insurance companies for their work, in spite of the obvious conflict of interest.\nThus the fact that this article has a strong bias towards presenting ME/CFS as an biopsychosocial condition (a bias which is not supported by any science) suggests that some of the main editors here who are promoting the biopsychosocial view may be paid stooges for the disability insurance industry. So can people like ,  and others here who have a pro-biopsychosocial stance categorically state that they are not being paid by the disability insurance industry, and are not receiving any form of benefit from this or any other industry or outside interests? There are several people who are persistent editors on this ME/CFS page, who work hard and tirelessly to make ME/CFS look as if it were a biopsychosocial illness.\nWikipedia does have many editors who are paid by corporate interests to manipulate articles; see here for example: Some People Get Paid a Lot of Money to Edit Wikipedia Pages. Wikipedia rules state that paid editors who receive compensation for their contributions to Wikipedia, either directly or indirectly, MUST disclose who is paying them to edit. So that is why I am asking the editors of this page who have a pro-biopsychosocial view of ME/CFS and a major interest in this article to declare whether or not they receive any form of payment, benefit or compensation for their work on this article.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by    \nAspro: @46.208.234.40  Er uh humm....

A minor Hungarian noble and co-leader of a Royal Geographical Society archeological and surveying expedition in Egypt and Libya, the Count and his English partner, Peter Madox, are academics at heart, with little knowledge of the brewing war. The British couple, Geoffrey and Katherine Clifton, fly to the camp with their purported, privately-owned Boeing-Stearman. He is frequently away mapping. The infidelity of Katherine and Almásy founders on her guilt and his jealousy.\nIn the months before the war, the Count studies an ancient Saharan site, the Cave of Swimmers. A government order stops work at the camp and Peter leaves his Tiger Moth at Kufra ossis before he and the Count go their separate ways.\nCaravaggio lost his thumbs to interrogation, by a German Army officer in Tobruk, and he seeks to avenge the transgression. He accuses the patient of betrayal. The patient explains the British betrayed him.\nWhen Geoffrey discovers the affair, he pilots the Boeing-Stearman, into a crash at the camp: Geoffrey is killed instantly, Katherine is seriously injured, and Almásy narrowly hit. He leaves her in the ''Cave'' with provisions, then begins a three-day walk for help. Dazed and dehydrated, he gets to British-held El Tag. During official questioning about the spelling of his name, he becomes agitated, is detained and in chains transported on a train north to Benghazi. He escapes behind Afrika Korps lines and trades the British maps to the Germans for gasoline. He flies the Tiger Moth to the ''Cave'', but is too late.\nHe attempts to return Katherine's body but a German anti-aircraft battery shoots them down. Her body is not recovered in the crash; he is horribly burned and rescued by Bedouin.\nCarvaggio is ready to forgive.

It was cherry picked from an old article. What I propose is a piece taken from Engineering News.\nI propose this portion of the lede is removed\nRossi and Focardi say the device works by infusing heated hydrogen into nickel, transmuting it into copper and producing heat.[9][10] An international patent application[1] has received an unfavorable international preliminary report on patentability because it seemed to \"offend against the generally accepted laws of physics and established theories\" and to overcome this problem the application should have contained either experimental evidence or a firm theoretical basis in current scientific theories.[11]\nThe device has been demonstrated to invited audiences several times, and commented on by various academics and others, but no independent tests have been reported by sources independent of Rossi, and no peer-reviewed tests have been reported in scientific publications. Steve Featherstone wrote in Popular Science that by the summer of 2012 Rossi's \"outlandish claims\" for the E-Cat seemed \"thoroughly debunked\" and that Rossi \"looked like a con man clinging to his story to the bitter end.\"[12]\nAnd replaced by this taken from Engineering News\n“Rossi allowed third-party investigators to test an improved version of the E-Cat unit he first demonstrated in October 2011, called the Hot Cat or E-Cat HT (where HT indicates high temperature).\nThe evaluation was performed by seven scientists: Giuseppe Levi, of Bologna University; Evelyn Foschi, of Bologna; Torbjörn Hartman, Bo Höistad, Roland Pettersson and Lars Tegnér, of Upssala University, in Sweden; and Hanno Essén, of Sweden’s Royal Institute of Technology.\nTheir 29-page report, titled ‘Indication of anomalous heat energy production in a reactor device containing hydrogen loaded nickel powder’, was originally posted on May 6 on Cornell University’s scientific archive website, at http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.3913. A revised version was uploaded four days later, but it should be noted that the paper has not yet been through a scientific peer-review process, and so its findings should be regarded as provisional. The authors were careful with their use of the word ‘indication’ rather than ‘proof’.\nTwo separate tests were performed on the E-Cat HT – one in December 2012, which lasted 96 hours, and another in March, which tested an improved prototype running continuously for 116 hours. The scientists used a thermal imaging camera to quantify the heat output of the E-Cat HT, together with electronic equipment to measure the electrical power input that kick-starts the reaction. Both tests yielded evidence of so-called ‘anomalous heat production’ “in decidedly higher quantities than what may be gained from any conventional [energy] source”.\nMore strikingly, the authors conclude that “volumetric and gravimetric energy densities were found to be far above those of any known chemical source”. They state further that, “even by the most conservative assumptions as to the errors in the measurements, the result is still one order of magnitude (ten times) greater than conventional energy sources”.\nSome commentators maintain that the test might somehow have been rigged by Rossi, for example, by hiding an additional source of electrical energy input. In follow-up comments on the Web, the authors of the report say this is very unlikely.”\nRef http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/interest-in-lenr-device-resurges-as-independent-report-is-released-2013-06-07\nAdrian Ashfield    \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack? \nTrue\nFalse\n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either True or False with without using any other words.\n",
    "267": "Sumple: As I've said before, I don't feel the notability or \"encyclopaedicity\" of the \"joke\" has been established. I will deconstruct the version favoured by Certified.Gangsta below. Further discussions are welcome: please post it below.\n''Wang Wei in English can sound very much like ''Wrong Way''''.\nThere are no major verification issues with this segment, although I would contend that \"very much\" is exaggerating the similarity, and \"in English\" should be placed after \"Wrong Way\", since Wang Wei pronounced ''in Chinese'' sounds like Wrong Way ''in English''\n''humourous to some considering the PRC pilot killed himself by crashing his jet fighter into the slow-moving propellor plane.''\nThis segment is factually incorrect. As the rest of the article indicates, all we know is that the two planes collided. We don't know who crashed ''into'' whom. Saying that Wang Wei \"killed himself\" also places responsibility for the collision on him - which, again, is inaccurate because we don't know who ran into whom. Furthermore, no evidence points towards a deliberate act on his part in order to run into the American plane, so he can't be said to have \"killed himself\".\n\nExamining the sources provided for this sentence:\n the first source is a column from a university publication. It is difficult for me to say whether it is intended to be humourous or deliberately offensive to people from other countries - that is not the issue. The problem with this source is that it simply illustrates that the columnist ''believed'' 1) that the fault for the incident lies with the Chinese, and 2) that \"Wang Wei\" is ''pronounced'' \"Wrong Way\". What it ''does not'' illustrate are whether 1) anyone else is calling him \"Wrong Way\", or whether 2) either the columnist or anyone else think the pun is funny.\n the second source does not even mention the pun: it only quotes a poem that rhymes \"wrong way\" with \"Wang Wei\". Rhyming A with B is a far cry from playing a pun on A with B. This source does not support the sentence.\n the third source is not even about Wang Wei or the Hainan incident. All it mentions is: \"Because his name sounds like 'wrong way' he became fodder for late night comedians amongst others.\" Firstly, this is a blog, hosted on blogspot, and is thus not usually regarded as a reliable source. Secondly, it has only a passing reference to his name sounding like \"wrong way\". Thirdly, nowhere does it say that the author thinks that the pun is humourous, or that anyone else thinks the pun is humourous.\n''Talk show comics, such as Bill Maher, played on this joke at the time. ''\nThe source is a '''forum post'''!!! Okay, I'm not even going to dignify that with an analysis.\n''Wang Wei also came to be nominated for a Darwin Award because of his exploits. ''\nThere is nothing wrong with this statement per se. My only problem is that the Darwin AWard nomination has nothing to do with the \"Wrong Way\" pun. Is being ''nominated'' for (not ''winning'') a Darwin Award notable enough for inclusion in Wikipedia?\n''Some Chinese took offense to this poking fun at his name; also fearing it was part of a larger backlash. ''\nNo-one in the news item even says that his name sounds like \"Wrong Way\". The only person who talks about the \"Wrong Way\" connection is an anonymous caller to a racist radio station, who said that the pilot \"should change his name to ''Wong Wei''\", ''not'' \"wrong way\".\nIn summary, there are many problems with both the factual accuracy and the citations for this section. I would appreciate it if editors on both sides of the debate can address the issues I have raised here. Chenquieh  \nEnochlau:  These sentiments echo mine entirely.

Believe me, many people, when they see that someone opposes \"initiation of force\" their first objection is \"Duh. How can you defend yourself if you're against initiation of force?\" Then one has to go through the whole explanation that defending oneself is a secondary use of force  ...force used when someone else uses initiatory force. This is a neutral distinction that has nothing to do with anarcho-capitalism in and of itself. What is the problem? Is it that you don't get the distinction either? \nKevehs:   I already explained the problem above.  Anarcho-capitalists define intiation of force to include things like trepass of property, or eating an apple shoplifted from a store.  Commonly, or at the very least amongst a significant number of people, initation of force is considered to apply only or generally to the physical person, violence or restraint used against a body.  So for the article to say that they are against initiation of force when they in fact support using force to repel say, non-aggressive trespassers, or at times even to forcefully claim restitution or enact punishment on a shoplifter, is biased in favor of a conception of initiation of force that is specific to anarcho-capitalists.  The only reason I'm letting the claim stand is because it is now clearly labeled as a claim, but your import of (initiation of force as distinct from response) throws that NPOV out the window and tells the reader that yes, in fact the capitalists are always -responding- to force when they enact their little system of property domination.   \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack? \nTrue\nFalse\n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either True or False with without using any other words.\n",

While there are cases of someone falsifying research and fooling peer reviewers, they are usually caught, with the end of their academic and research career and widely publicized scandal. This is why drug companies want independent researchers to test their drugs at early stages of development. If something looks promising, other researchers and companies quickly test similar or closely related substances. You seem to have this bizarre fantasy that if something looks promising, other companies will band together to pay off hundreds of doctors and scientists to suppress or persuade everyone to ignore it, or that thousands of doctors and scientists will not be able to recognize that it has potential value.\nThere is no better counterexample to the ridiculousness of your fantasies than what is currently going on with vitamin D. Vitamin D is a perfect example of an unpatentable dietary supplement; in the last 5 years it has become red-hot in terms of research interest because of mounting evidence that it plays a role in immune regulation, resistance to cancer, resistance to autoimmune disease, and even regulation of insulin sensitivity. Many doctors have conducted and are conducting studies to see if supplementation is beneficial in terms of treatment. Reports about these were among the most crowded sessions of The Endocrine Society annual scientific sessions in Toronto earlier this month. Amazingly, not a single pharmaceutical company has tried to suppress this information, and amazingly (considered how blinded you think most doctors and scientists are by the pharmaceutical industry paradigm) there is no one saying the research shouldn't be done! And vitamin D cannot even be patented! How can that be happening?\nAnd here is a another example that doesn't fit your world view: there is a huge debate going on right now as to the safety of rosiglitazone (Avandia), a multimillion dollar product of Glaxo, a major pharmaceutical company. There was strong evidence that it improved insulin sensitivity and even prevented development of diabetes in those close to getting it. Yet, in a big study of about 10,000 patients, there were about 6 more cases of heart attack death in the patients taking Avandia than those not taking it. So we are going through a highly public debate over the value of the drug, based on clinical trial statistics, publicly discussed. Nearly all of the doctors publicly quoted about this have been financially associated with Glaxo or other pharmaceutical companies, and whenever they talk about this at medical meetings (like the Endocrine Society meetings earlier this month), they are required to disclose this. It doesn't mean no one listens to what they have to say, but we take it into account.\nIt is an imperfect process, but compared to this, the nutraceutical industry operates in secret and hides its research data. Its companies donate huge amounts to politicians to subvert attempts by the FDA to address simple safety concerns (e.g., the ephedrine scandal of a few years ago). It isn't that most doctors and scientists trust drug companies and hate nutraceutical companies it's that most of us mistrust ''all'' big corporations to act in the public interest if it will cost them money. However, most of think that those corporations that fail to disclose evidence of safety and efficacy and pay politicians to continue to be allowed do so are far more dangerous and far less credible. So please spare us your naive nonsense about our inability to recognize bias. If any Mannatech product had any therapeutic value, the company would have sponsored trials long ago to publicly demonstrate this. The orphan drug laws are a gold mine for a company that has a product that helps a little girl with a devastating, untreatable disease. Watch what is happening with the company making a drug for Farber disease, so rare that as of last year they hadn't even treated anyone. So tell us why Mannatech chose to use a poor child who died of Tay-Sachs disease as an advertising example, even after the child was dead and the parent asked them to stop because it hadn't helped . When you tell us there are \"tens of thousands\" of cases of therapeutic efficacy, why do you think the company advertised a single example of failure, misrepresenting it for years as an example of success? Is it because Mannatech is in the business of selling distributorships, not drugs, so they can distance themselves from those who have to lie to sell a worthless product? How can ''you'' have any respect for a company that wants people to think its products treat diseases but wants people like you and the distributors to tell the lies so it can deny them?  \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack? \nTrue\nFalse\n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either True or False with without using any other words.\n",

    "294": "Blackmetalbaz: On sourcing\nBlackmetalbaz: OK,  has requested admin interventon regarding this article, so I thought I'd make a few comments in response. Firstly, I'd like to point out a common misconception regarding list articles; it is perfectly possible for bands to appear on multiple \"genre lists\". For example, Dissection can happily appear on the list of death metal bands, the list of melodic death metal bands and the list of black metal bands, as long as reliable sources (e.g. from professional journalists) are provided. In fact, as part of a compromise following a previous discussion, we included the line \"The list includes bands that have been described as nu metal by professional journalists at some stage in their career\" in the intro to this article. The sources provided for the supposedly contentious inclusions here all pass WP:RS easily, but more on them later. A more important aspect of 's edits to this article (and others) is that they do not seem to recognise the term \"nu metal\" as a legitimate genre classification... see for example deletion attempts here and here. However, these all ended in speedy closes as a cursory look Google Books reveals numerous published books dedicated to the genre, including the likes of Tommy Udo's ''Brave Nu World'' (which  claims I have been misquoting; of which more later) and Joel McIver's ''Nu Metal: The Next Generation of Rock and Punk''. The term is also frequently used by ''Kerrang!'', ''Metal Hammer'', ''Guitar World'' (which has a whole book dedicated to it, including System of a Down and Incubus, two supposedly contentious inclusions, found ), MTV, ''Stylus Magazine'' and many others.\nRegarding specific references,  claims that the sources don't say what they do in fact say. They initially claimed for instance that Tommy Udo was \"an obscure author\" whose journalistic credibility is presumably in question, despite having written for ''Sounds'', ''City Limits'', ''The Guardian'', ''Uncut'', ''Bizarre'', ''Metal Hammer'' and the NME. His book ''Brave Nu World'', (ISBN 1-86074-415-X, Sanctuary Publishing) is explicitly about the nu metal genre. Whilst  claimed \"The books refer to late-1990s alternative rock in general\", the sleeve of the book states \"Veteran rock journalist Tommy Udo takes a long hard stare at nu metal through the eyes of the playas, the skaters, the whiggers, the wannabes and the detractors\". Fairly unambiguous. Looking inside the book Udo makes is clear what he is defining as nu metal and what he is not. The bulk of the book is devoted to chapters on specific bands (namely Korn, Limp Bizkit, Staind, Linkin Park, Deftones, Slipknot and Kittie). Chapter 9 is entitled \"The Second Wave and the New Nu Breed: Tomorrow's Major Players\" (pp.148-199). It opens, \"As well as major players like Korn and Limp Bizkit, nu metal has produced a strong second wave of bands who are less obviously in the rap-metal mould, and who appeal to a smaller and more defined fanbase.\" It continues, \"There is a veritable plethora of second-wave bands, ranging from the good (Dry Kill Logic, Ill Nino, Papa Roach, (hed) pe) to interchangeable clones of the more successful players.\" He then proceeds detail a number of bands he sees as being the major players in this \"second wave of nu metal\", specifically Godsmack (pp.149-152), Static-X (pp. 153-159), Spineshank (pp.159-163), Orgy (pp.163-166), Papa Roach (pp.166-169), Incubus (pp.169-172), Mudvayne (pp.172-174), (hed)pe (pp.174-175), Deadsy (pp.176-177), Adema (pp.177-79), Apartment 26 (pp.179-180), Glassjaw (pp.180-182), Taproot (pp.182-183), System of a Down (pp.183-185), Dry Kill Logic (pp.185-186), Crazy Town (pp.187-188), Will Haven (pp.188-190), Puddle of Mudd (pp.190-191), Cold (pp.191-193), Ill Nino (pp.193-194), Disturbed (pp.194-195), Sevendust (pp.195-196), Coal Chamber (pp.197-199). Again, fairly unambiguous. It's made even clearer by the next chapter which discusses bands occasionally associated with nu metal but are not in the author's eyes (e.g. Marilyn Manson, Kid Rock etc.). Udo goes on at the end of the book to list what he regards as nu metal \"essential listening; he includes SOAD's ''Toxicity'', (hed)pe's ''Broke'', Incubus' ''Morning View'' and the Snot/various artists ''Strait Up''. The claim that the information is not in the source is therefore either dishonest or deliberately ignorant. Furthermore, this is not the only source being used... we have Joel McIver, Allmusic and a swift look on Google Books reveals others. Regarding SOAD, ''Stylus Magazine'' even goes so far as to state, \"“But wait, these guys aren’t nu-metal! They’re too good!” So the cries will inevitably go, which speaks more to the initial prejudice the public has against nu-metal than to System of a Down’s qualifications for the genre. System of a Down do in fact bear all the hallmarks of a nu-metal band, but they play with such passion, complexity and bizarreness that many consider the label of nu-metal to be beneath them. And while that’s ridiculous, it is true that they are that far ahead of the curve—in fact, they’ve replaced Rage Against the Machine in my heart as the best pseudo-topical, bizarre, fucking rocking band out there right now. Not bad.\" The POV-pushing becomes even more obvious when you notice only a subset of sourced bands are being removed. Despite claims to the contrary, this is not an ownership issue, nor am I aware of any WP:CIVIL breaches on my part. The mentions are \"blocks\" were not threats merely an observation that  (an editor that has seemingly done sterling work on various film articles) has been previously blocked for edit-warring and sockpuppetry with regards to nu metal articles.

Second, their use of the terms was prescriptivist, while Wikipedia is a descriptivist resource.

I guess you could use multiple blog sources to prove it is a way people use a term, but it would take MULTIPLE sources, not just one, and again, the article was making grossly inaccurate claims about how people refer to nu metalcore bands and then using it to make grossly inaccurate claims about what bands constitute nu metalcore.   \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack? \nTrue\nFalse\n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either True or False with without using any other words.\n",

Kauffman, Ph.D., Professor Emeritus of the Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry at University of the Sciences in Philadelphia, USP - Faculty was published in the Journal of Scientific Exploration (JSE). Kauffmann JM (2002). Website Review: Alternative Medicine: Watching the Watchdogs at Quackwatch., Journal of Scientific Exploration, '''16''', 2 Kauffman is also the author of ''Malignant Medical Myths: Why Medical Treatment Causes 200,000 Deaths in the USA each Year and How to Protect Yourself.'' Joel Kauffman, ''Malignant Medical Myths: Why Medical Treatment Causes 200,000 Deaths in the USA each Year and How to Protect Yourself.'' Infinity Publishing (January 30, 2006) ISBN 0-7414-2909-8 His article in JSE examined eight Quackwatch articles for factuality, fairness and scientific currency; Kauffman found the articles to be \"''contaminated with incomplete data, obsolete data, technical errors, unsupported opinions, and/or innuendo''\" and cited the peer-reviewed literature in support of his conclusions. Kauffman wrote that:\n\"''Hostility to all alternatives was expected and observed from the website, but not repetition of groundless dogma from mainstream medicine...It remains a mystery how they [Quackwatch] and I have interpreted the same body of medical science and reached such divergent conclusions.....It is very probable that many...vistors to the website have been misled by the trappings of scientific objectivity...At least 3 of the activities in the Mission Statement...have been shown to be flawed as actually executed...Medical practitioners such as Robert Atkins, Elmer Cranton and Stanislaw Burzynski, whom I demonstrated are not quacks, were attacked with the energy one would hope to be focused on real quacks. The use of this website is not recommended. It could be deleterious to your health.  ''\"\nIf you have read Kauffman's article you must recognize that it displays every single flaw he imputes to quackwatch: he misrepresents legitimate scientific and medical controversies (e.g., about cholesterol), attacks Barrett for positions that he does not argue in detail and are peripheral to the purpose and scope of the website, uncritically accepts and argues only the quack sides of controversies, and the article is dripping with innuendo and unsupported villification, which is exactly what he criticizes Quackwatch for. He claims to have established that Atkins, Cranton, and Burzynski \"are not quacks\" but in fact did no such thing, while Barrett mainly claimed that their treatments were unproven. I have no objection to listing him and referencing his article as part of a list of critics, but his article is too weak to deserve to be referred to in this article as some sort of objective scientific review. If there had been any substance in his criticisms, you know it would have been published in a real medical journal. Mainstream medical journals such as NEJM and Lancet attack medical practices and institutions every month, but the attacks are intelligent, usually accurate, and have been peer-reviewed.

I wouldn't mind removing it, but since we have a reliable source stating how historically rare and insignificant those images were, one would think that another RS should be introduced first (claiming the opposite). In fact, 4-5 books in 1400+ years is extremely rare, and some poetry books created for private use is by definition \"historical trivia\". I thought the above quote aptly expresses this fact. ()\nJohnbod: There are certainly more books than 4-5 (even Commons has images from more than that), and were almost certainly more than now exist, as the survival rate for this and other forms of medieval Islamic art is low, as manuscripts were concentrated in court libraries, which tended to have fires sooner or later. I have just been addressing this issue at the other page. The only person cited in the source (Arnold, itself of 1928) as believing they did not exist is a single German writing in 1906. He is certainly wrong, and it is deliberately misleading to include this point, with the implication there might be something in it, in a very brief lead.  Much longer modern accounts understandably never mention it.  The court miniature traditions are generally accepted as a major aspect of Islamic art, though enjoyment of them was restricted to a tiny minority of the population - but this was true of many other forms of art, calligraphy for one.  The number of surviving manuscripts is not enormous & images of Muhammad appear pretty regularly in manuscripts of history and poetry which cover his life, and some genealogies etc.  The subject is certainly not \"by definition \"historical trivia\"\".  Arnold is now a rather outdated source, and is being leaned on too heavily here, as well as being used selectively to support a POV position.

Sure, the best telescopes couldn't resolved it as anything more then a point of light, but that's ok. And everyone was happy. Until Pallas was discovered. \"Well, that's ok. We'll have another planet!\" And then came Juno. \"And another!\" After some time, they eventually realised that thousands of these odd \"Asteroids\" would be found, and that they couldn't fit in well with the big planets known at the time (Mercury to Neptune). So then the planet count went back down to 8. Until Pluto was discovered. Pretty much the same thing happened, it was definently a planet, although an oddball too. Until 1992. Something else was found beyond Neptune. It was smaller, but it was in the same area. Doubt lingered, but then along came some others. Sedna, Quaoar, and then \"X\". We face the same problem today. We ''know'' that out there is something like an asteroid belt, but with ice instead of rock. Perhaps \"X\" and Pluto would just be really big comets in the Kuiper Belt.  Maybe if something is mostly made of ice, it can't be a planet, because if brought close to the Sun, it vanishes pretty quickly.

    "365": "E. Ripley: Okay, just to refocus things a bit.  Let's concentrate on the disagreements in the first paragraph.  I've cleaned it up removing refs etc. for readability.  The anon is seeking to have the first paragraph say:  ''Plus-size model is a term applied to a person who is engaged primarily in modeling garments that are designed specifically for fat or overweight people.''\n3RingCircus would prefer an opening paragraph that says this:  ''Plus-size model is a term applied to a person who is engaged primarily in modeling clothing offered in large or extended sizes (see plus-sized clothing). Females working as plus-size models range from U.S. size 8 and upwards, and are also engaged in work that is not strictly related to selling large-sized clothing, i.e. body acceptance commentary, stock photography, and advertising photography for cosmetics, household and pharmaceutical products, sunglasses, footwear and watches, etc. Therefore plus-size models do not exclusively wear garments marketed as plus-size clothing. This is especially true when participating in fashion editorials for mainstream fashion magazines.''\nThe two first sentences really convey the same thing.  Plus-size models primarily model plus-size garments.  Then 3ring goes on to describe what size plus-size models typically are, and expands on the idea that they do not only model plus-sized clothing, but rather items such as watches and the like.  (I would go even farther, and point out that people who model plus-sized clothing often are not really plus-sized themselves, but let's not muddy the water).  I think the first sentence we largely have agreement on, save some minor wording issues.  The question really is whether or not to include the rest that 3ring wants.  Anon, can you tell me why you dislike the rest of what 3ring wants to include in the opener?  It doesn't really seem unreasonable to me generally speaking, but maybe I'm missing some nuance.  — \\\n3RingCircus: E.Ripley, it would seem I have to be very specific here.  I realize that my posts and work-it-out-in-writing thought process make it dificult to follow my intent, so to summarize and be really clear (and please excuse my lack of knowledge on blockquoting and proper layout).\nPrior to the edit war with Anon/IP:79.97.166.36, the opening sentence of the article was as follows:'' '''Plus-size model''' is a term internationally applied to a woman who is engaged primarily in modeling garments that are designed and marketed specifically for larger body sizes and types (see plus-size clothing)''.  This article's editors had previously (see: [Section 6, para 4/5/6]) reached a consensus regarding the wording of the first sentence with particular regards to mention of plus-size clothing, i.e. that it be as unspecific as practical, if mention be made at all.\nAnonymous User/IP 79.97.166.36 edited this statement to read: ''Plus-size model is a term applied to a person who is engaged primarily in modeling garments that are designed specifically for fat or overweight people[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] (see plus-size clothing).'' and reverted it a number of times to this wording after editors altered it on the basis that 'fat or overweight' was pejorative or not accurately describing who wears plus size clothing.   After I raised discussion on whether the phrase \"fat or overweight\" was pejorative, User 24.215.23.237 wrote in Section 32 on 4Sept09 that  ''79.97.166.36 is being selective in his definitions. The full OED has two different defintions, one for \"plus size,\" one for \"plus-sized\". They are as follows:\nplus size n. and adj. orig. U.S. (a) n. a large size of clothing; (b) adj. (usu. with hyphen) = plus-sized adj.\nplus-sized adj. orig. U.S. (of clothing) sized to fit an overweight or fat person, usually a woman; euphem. (of a person, usually a woman) overweight; fat.  Since we are being very particular here, this article is titled \"plus-size model,\" therefore there is no reason not to use the first definition.  Also, a useful fix to this controversy is '''not to speculate as to the persons for whom plus-size clothing is marketed'''. (After all, even male transvestites purchase plus-size female clothing, and they may not be fat or overweight at all, simply large due to their gender.)  '''Therefore, to sat (sic) that a plus-size model is engaged in \"modelling large sizes of clothing\" is the most accurate statement that one can make, fits with the OED definition, and does not engage in questionable and unnecessary speculation as to the identity of the individuals who purchase the products'''. 24.215.23.237 (talk) ''\nI thought this statement was a logical and sound interpretation of the OED and its best applicability to the article, so I agreed with User 24.215.23.237 as to the irrelevance of Anon's edits, and made the following comment: \"''... the size range of agency career models (i.e. not internet glamour or 'hobby' models) completely separates them from the sizing of plus-sized clothing and therefore there should be no more confusing discussion of plus-size clothing nor who that clothing is made for.'' \" 3RingCircus 124.184.249.159 (talk) .  Although in retrospect my comment reads a little heavyhanded and 'pronouncement-like', I felt that a consensus on the matter was reached between editors of the article both now and previously, as it was directly in-line with consensus reached as described above in Section 6, and so I adjusted the article accordingly.  Shortly thereafter, Anon/User 79.97.166.36 reverted the opening sentence to their original edit, as they have continually done since their first edit to this article.\nTo date: Anon/User 79.97.166.36 blatantly disregards prior consensus reached, reverts with no regard for other editors' work, and has received no consensus relating to their edits.  Whenever this matter of clothing sizes comes up, even if it is discussed differently and among different editors, the same consensus is reached - that mention of specifics be avoided, as it has its own article for such business. I remind Anon/User 79.97.166.36 that consensus is a fundamental policy for Wiki editors.  Not one single person has agreed with Anon that this sentence, \"Plus-size model is a term applied to a person who is engaged primarily in modeling garments that are designed specifically for fat or overweight people[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] (see plus-size clothing)\" should remain as it stands on this article, or at plus-size clothing where it better fits.\nE.Ripley, I request only that the original opening sentence'' '''Plus-size model''' is a term internationally applied to a woman who is engaged primarily in modeling garments that are designed and marketed specifically for larger body sizes and types (see plus-size clothing)'' be reinserted (sentences following can remain as updated), and that Anon/User 79.97.166.36 be cautioned to stop editing against consensus.   \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack? \nTrue\nFalse\n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either True or False with without using any other words.\n",

Here's my analysis of sources and facts:\n the reviewed edits were at first highly constructive, with informative edit summaries reflecting the spirit of WP:BRD\n regarding , I agree with VM that it is not a source sufficient for the lead, however I think such opinion pieces can still be discussed in the text, where they should be properly attributed (to the author or newspaper). The unemployment issue is certainly worth discussing, and with this source I think it may be included in the lead (through in a shorter version, most details and refs should go into their own section).\n  this edit was not good, as I don't think that it's fair to summarize the 1989 changes as directly leading to incrase of debt]. The sentence would be more neutral if it said \"the debt increased from x in 1989 to y in 2014. A graph would be nice. And are we sure this is the best section for this sentence?\n  this new section by VM seems well referenced, and does discuss the raising unemployment rate\n  while the removal of this by VM was not discussed in the edit summary, removing unreferenced and potentially POV/promotional info like this is good policy\n new content added at  and  by VM seems fine\n regarding this edit by Molobo, he is right that the source did not justify the assertion that the unemployment rate started to raise in 2012. The source mentions a raise in 2012, yes, but the accompanying graph at  suggest it was raising at least since 2011. The source added by Molobo -  - seems reliable and pretty good for expanding on the trend. However, the statement that \"Polish unemployment remains one of the highest in EU\" sourced to  is problematic. The source is from 2006, and so the sentence should be clarified with \"as of 2006\".  seems an ok source for the argument that high unemployment rate is a problem, despite high growth GDP wise.\n  this is fine, the source states \" The policies left millions out of work\"\n  is a good clarification for why our two statistics differ\n  ok source for 2 millions who migrated, but I am a bit uneasy using this for the \"expected to cause trouble\". We should attribute this (to Polish Radio 1 journalist, Sylwia Zadrożna), otherwise it's somewhat of a journalistic editorializing.\n  seems like a valid fact to add\n looking at the source, , the figure 46% is correct, but which part is used to justify the claim \"especially problematic in Poland\"? Compared to what?\n  comparing purchasing power parity seems reasonable, through as I noted earlier this source should be attributed.

Knowing that you have been a significant contributor to the article wiki_link, perhaps you could provide an alternate opinion. Even though it wasn't the first or deadliest school shooting, I still believe it was a very notable event that affected the nation and world in many ways in the year 2008 (gun politics, higher education, mental health, journalism ethics, video game politics, emergency preparedness, etc.). I even backed it up with three international sources (from Australia and the U.K.), which I felt demonstrated the event's global importance. Unfortunately, people disagreed with that. Mind you, the event had been listed in that article all year, and only did it become a problem when I tried to add an image on the article recently. I stopped trying to put the image on there, but then they outright deleted the text entry about the event, which I thought was very uncalled for, and utterly ridiculous, considering it was perhaps one of the biggest media events of the year. Perhaps you could help revert this senseless deletion of a notable entry and provide some input on the wiki_link. Thanks for your help! \nHuskyHuskie: Regrettably, I feel that this simply demonstrates how inane it is to have articles on years and decades.  I agree with you that it was a noteworthy event, but such things are infinitely subjective, and (I feel) not worth the effort needed to wage the battle.  I would rather be Don Quixote and take on the ''existence of the article wiki_link''.  I mean, what makes ''this'' year particularly noteworthy?  I think that 1989, 1848, and 1776 are all exceptional years, and more worthy of an article than, say, 1922.  We don't provide every author an article just because he wrote a book, and we don't give every American mayor an article, even if he is re-elected three times.  We are supposed to touch upon the ''noteworthy''.  The NIU shooting is more notable than many events in wiki_link, but wiki_link is not worth the time of day to me (at least, not yet.

Much current research (like that of Clive Holes) even suggests the presence of dialects in competition with Classical Arabic, which makes touting it as a cover-all 'ancestor' even harder to justify.

Unfortunately, this is what I've seen with many wikipedia articles in general. There are a lot of \"experts\" who unfortunately don't know much. This is especially the case for many math articles I see, but not limited to that. The basic thrust of the article is totally wrong (case in point the bogus article 0.999999 = 1), or the explanation is muddled and confused. Typical of such math articles is to write down a bunch of impressive looking equations someone copied from a book and doesn't really understand.\nI would suggest that wikipedia is more a general encyclopedia for the general reader, not an advanced technical book. It fails on both counts in this case. The explanation is not comprehensible to the general reader, and is quite inadequate for the expert.\nThis \"explained in various ways\" reminds me of the famous \"five proofs\" or whatever number of God's existence. You don't need five proofs, you need just one. The reason five proofs are put forward is kind of desperation. Same here.\nIf someone who really understands math (or some other real subject beyond \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" plots or such, which is mostly what wikipedia is good for) tries to provide high quality information, teeming multitudes of \"experts\" shout him or her down. No insult intended, it's just the reality. Would you have 100 random people off the street wielding scalpels to do your brain surgery? No. Did a committee of 100 compose Beethoven's Fifth Symphony? No. Does a random committee of 100 adjudicate Supreme Court decisions? No.\nAnyway, off my soap box, back to the problem at hand, here is some help. This is not just a diatribe against wikipedia, but a genuine desire to help the editors who are trying to produce something worthwhile.\nTake the numbers 1 to 9. Call them measurements in yards. The first digit happens 1 time for each number. No \"Benford's law\" so far. Then multiple them all by something, say 3. Aha! You will see \"Benford's Law\" emerge.\nMeasurement numbers (distances, times, etc.) are arbitrary, based on the units and the base. Suppose you convert yards to feet, as suggested above. 1 -> 3; 2 -> 6; 3 -> 9; 4 -> 12; 5 -> 15; 6 -> 18; 7 -> 21; 8 -> 24; 9 -> 27. \"Benford's law\" rear's it's ugly head. If you just look a little, it's obvious that it's easier to \"get to 1\" than to \"get to 9\" by multiplying. Big deal. )\nOr suppose you are counting sheep for your insomnia. If the count is in the range 90 to 99 before nodding off, that's 10 slots possible. Moving on to 100-199, that's 100 slots, so ones will tend to \"crowd out\" the nines. Suppose you go to sleep on sheep 166. Leading 1 wins! But even if you dozed off at sheep 966, leading 1 would STILL win out. Nine has zero chance to \"win\", can only tie at best, such as 9 or 99 sheep.\n\"Benford's law\" intuitively boils down to the basic facts: *** In incrementing numbers 1 comes before 2, so 1 \"has more chances\" to be the first digit. *** In multiplying numbers 1 is smaller than 2, so the chance that the product of X with a number starting with 1 results in a number starting with 1 is greater than the chance that the product of X with a number starting with 2 results in results in a number staring with 2.\nTo show the somewhat arbitrary nature of \"Benford's law\", suppose you started with 999,999,999 sheep, and counted down, somewhat in the vein of \"99 bottles of beer on the wall\". ) Then all the numbers would start with 9, assuming your insomnia was not permanent. \"Benford's law\" would be totally reversed.\nI normally do not spend time on wikipedia.

    "434": "Maunus: It makes no sense to remove this because of the publisher. Many of the authors (and one of the editors) are well respected scholars with many serious publications behind them - they are part of the scholarly dialogue already. The fact that no responses have been published yet only means that we shouldn't go into details in presenting their arguments. The book should be mentioned because it shows that there is some recent scholarly interest in exploring the hypothesis. There is no rule against mentioning the existence of self published publications (nor against citing them if they are written by notable authors).·\nDominus Vobisdu: Sorry, but no. A book or article by even an eminent scientist is not worth much unless it has been peer reviewed, or unless it has been proven to be part of the scientific discourse. As of now, we have no idea how much weight to assign to the various viewpoints in the book. Messers. Vaneechoutte, Kuliukas and Verhaegen, and the individual authors, had every opportunity to get their work published by a real scientific publisher that conducts real peer review. They didn't, and thus have to wait until their peers evaluate it. Right now, it carries as much weight as an e-book self-published by you, me or any other memeber of the general public. The value of a scientific paper does not depend on the reputation or notability of its author(s).\nThere is no value in mentioning the book to our readership because we have no way of knowing weather it contains any information of any value, as it has not undergone peer review. It also cannot be accessed without actually personally purchasing it, and for a steep price. Our readers cannot go to a library and read it, for example.\nMessers. Vaneechoutte, Kuliukas and Verhaegen by-passed the normal scientific publishing process in order to promote themselves and their product. The source thus fails the self-serving clause of WP:SPS. Both Dr. Vaneechoutte and Mr. Kuliukas have turned up here on WP to promote the book themselves, though, to his credit, Dr. Vaneechoutte ceased when advised of the problems with the source. I've advised Dr. Vaneechoutte to recover the manuscript from Bentham and publish it properly. Once they do so, we can mention the book. Or we can wait until it gets substantial attention from the mainstream scientific community so that we can determine what weight it should be assigned.\nUntil then, it's anyone's guess what part this book plays (if any) in scholarly discourse on this topic, and considering the way it was published, it is unlikely that it will ever play a significant role. Also, there is essentially no difference between a self-published e-book and a self-published blog, except that you have to pay to view the e-book. Anyone can publish an e-book with Bentham about any nonsense whatsoever, as long as Bentham believes they can make money off of it. Bentham's interest in this book is purely financial and they take no editorial responsibility for, or interest in, its content.   \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack? \nTrue\nFalse\n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either True or False with without using any other words.\n",

I don't like the continuation of that last sentence, though I could perhaps live with it.  The problem with all of that material is that ''it isn't about Debito Arudou''.  It's about the book, not about Arudou's reaction to it. That information is in Kyōgaku no Gaijin Hanzai Ura File – Gaijin Hanzai Hakusho 2007, where it belongs. Putting it here is definitely WP:UNDUE (because it's including information only tangentially related to the subject of the article), and borderline coatracking, because it's attempting to use this article as a vessel to further Arudou's opinions about the book.
