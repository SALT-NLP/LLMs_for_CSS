    "0": "Drmargi: The specials strike me as needing some reconsidering, and should all be added to the episode lists, not just a selected few.  They're specials, yes, but they're also Top Gear episodes that could be incorporated in much the same way as ''Vicar of Dibley'' or ''Doctor Who'' incorporate their special episodes into their respective articles.  Also, why is ''Stars in Fast Cars'' described as a special in the main article but not listed as one here?  Then, given we've now gotten a series of cross-country specials, should the US (FL-LA) and Botswana episodes be counted as a special, particularly considering US is titled ''The US Special'' on the DVD?   \nHalsteadk: If TG and the BBC call them \"specials\" then what basis do we have not to? I don't understand your edit summary that \"specials are entirely out of studio (and thus don't include US film)\". I seem to remember most have had an intro in the studio, perhaps the US one was the only(?) one to also have a studio piece at the end but it was the first one so maybe it's just different - don't see how that makes it not a special. Unless they're completely separate from a series run they should all be listed as episodes with an appropriate title (Botswana Special) etc.   \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack?  \n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either \"True\" or \"False\" with without using any other words.\n"
