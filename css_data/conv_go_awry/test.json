If I were to find a picture of them both together, I would consider this the \"Holy Grail\" of Surrealist Research. However, I read Peneople Rosemont's account of the alleged meeting, and considering that I have much experiece in Research and Statement Analysis, the account provided by Penelope Rosemont to journalist Danny Postel, had SO MANY Red Flags, that I just could not buy into the fact that the Rosemonts ever met personally with Andre Breton. This is TOO IMPORTANT a Fact to just pass over in such a fleeting manner. Daniel C.Boyer, who is supposed to be this important surrealist and promoter of his friends, does NOTHING to help us with this quest. The reason is simple, Franklin and Penelope Rosemont never met Andre Breton as they alleged. Not according to this tale of \"Personally meeting with Breton and being accepted by him into the Surrealist Movement\" it just doesn't hold any credit with me until I see either personal handwritten letters from Breton to Franklin or just one photo of the both of them. Also, consider the fact that his current 'icon' of Surrealism, Franklin Rosemont, is supposed to be this major figure in Surrealism, however, there is very limited visual material on his site. Why?????????????????? Also, consider Prof. Mary Ann Caws and Dawn Ades (and also noted scholar Jennifer Mundy) for a moment: I read practically all their written material on their research into Surrealism and you get more visual material on the most obscure surrealists from the past, than you do with Franklin Rosemont, note, that none of the above respected and established art scholars even mention Franklin Rosemont in their research. Maybe sometime in the future, but they have probably hit the same brick wall as I did. Also, look at Boyer and his friends, for a moment, that last \"surrealist\" show, did show pictures, but of the artworks only. NO Crowd shots of any people in attendance, NOTHING! DID anyone show up? Did any Surrealist or artist show up? I would support any mention of them, like I did with his friends in those groups that I added to the article, solely on the basis of Fairness and being a nice guy!

","59":"DRR75:  The film is authentic \nDRR75: I do understand that the Patterson-Gimlin film is still in dispute to this day.  I saw a Bigfoot back in June of 1991 and that kind of opened the door to me to the whole Bigfoot phenomena.  When I was a small child I saw the film and was scared of it.  After my sighting I watched the Patterson-Gimlin film several dozen times and I concluded Bigfoot I saw that day in 1991 looked VERY CLOSE to the creature in the Patterson-Gimlin film.  The creature in the film was just under 7' and was a female due to the fact that it had breasts.  The one I saw was about 8' and a male I believe.  In the last few years the film has undergone digital analysis and examination and those that did the analysis COULD NOT determine that the film was faked.  Bigfoot researcher John Green back in 1967 shortly after the film was made went back to the site and filmed a stand-in model-Jim McClarin- walking the same path that the creature took as a reference to determine the height and weight of the creature in the film.  The two films were superimposed to show the difference between the two.  McClarin stood 6'.5\".  The creature in the film was taller and much more bulkier.  The arms on the creature are longer than a normal man's arms.  I recently viewed the film digitally enhanced at a meeting of the International Bigfoot Society.  I could see the muscles moving underneath the hair of the creature.  The creature walks with an unusual bent-knee gait that is almost impossible to imitate.  The late Dr. Grover Krantz tried once to imitate it but was unsuccessful.  Several anatomists have recently discovered some sort of injury on the creature's knee as it flexes its knee when it's walking.  I can see no seams on the creature that would indicate a costume.  Apes have a natural hair seam running down the length of their spines.  As to the feet in the film- the area that the creature walked in the film was on sand and very soft soil which stuck to the creature's feet, as it would to any animal or human for that matter that would be walking in soil like that with bare feet.  When the creature turns to look at the camera, it just doesn't move its head- it moves its entire upper torso in the direction of the cameraman- just as an ape would do.  The creature turned to look at the camera because Bob Gimlin had crossed the creek and trained his rifle on it after Patterson told him to cover him in case the creature was agressive.  That's why the creature turned to look at the camera.  If this creature was a man in a costume, why would he risk his life with Gimlin having a loaded rifle aimed at him?  That doesn't make sense.  Patterson ran out of film because the rest of the film in his camera had been used filming scenery for a documentary he wanted to do.  Before he could change the film in his rented camera the creature had disappeared into the woods.  Patterson and Gimlin did trail it but couldn't go any further because the creature's trail went into the mountains and they couldn't follow with their horses and they weren't logistically equipped to go up the mountain after the creature.  The film is shaky because Patterson was running after the creature while he was filming it and finally stabilized himself on a tree stump.  Patterson did not know anything about cameras or film speeds.  I have personally met Bob Gimlin and heard what he had to say about what Patterson filmed that day.  He sticks to his story that what he saw that day was a flesh and blood creature and not some guy in a fur suit.  Gimlin never made any money whatsoever on the film.  I am not trying to say that what everyone else believes is wrong; I'm just saying what I know about the film and I believe it to be authentic.  This was suppossed to have been faked by an ex-rodeo cowboy?  Hardly.\nDarin (UTC","60":"Caspian blue: external_link, is the creator of the RFC\/U CoM? (his own RFC\/U?)

The statement is so narrowly focused that it is essentially wrong.  While the bandeirantes penetrated to the southern and southwestern borders, especially in the Cisplatina, Minas Gerais, Mato Grosso, and Goias areas, they were unknown or at least rare in the Salimoes region north of the Amazon and west of the Madeira.  By the end of the Bandeirante era in the first half of the 18th century, at the time of the Madrid Accord, the known world in Amazonian South America encompassed only the above mentioned states, plus a narrow strip in the lower Amazon centered on Belem along the Atlantic coast and inland along the Amazon to about the middle of what is today state of Para.  The western-most boundary fixed by the Accord was along the Madeira and Negro rivers, that in consequence of the fact the the \"map of the courts\" used was skewed by the Portuguese to collapse the vast Amazon into a narrow strip west of the Torsedillas Line; the Spanish didn't know the boundaries encompassed so much territory, nor that most of the northwestern upper Salimoes was not represented at all on the map, hence not allocated to either country.  The 1750 boundaries excluded most of what is today the state of Amazonas; those boundaries weren't fixed until late in the 18th century. The boundaries of Acre and Bolivia weren't fixrd until the 20th century.\nIn an overarching sense, the boundaries were fixed by mission occupancy, not bandeirante penetration. The Accord specified that the boundaries were to be fixed by \"what each [country] now holds\"; this resulted in Pombal's 1751 secret directive to the Brazilian Governor to establish a line of missions\/''feitorias'' along the rivers from Belem to the capital of Mato Grosso to establish occupancy that in fact did not exist at the time of the Accord.  We understand, as they did, that the Accord was based on occupancy, either missions, forts, or feitorias.\nThe statement about bandeiras needs to be changed.

In the case of Barack Obama, his lack of a son that shares his name adds an extra layer of ambiguity because the death of his father allowed him to drop the suffix entirely and that seems to be the route he took.  In most cases the addition of Jr. or Sr. is not a legal name, but is just an addition used to differentiate the father from the son.

And what the Prince of Wales thinks of his stepchildren and grandchildren does not matter too, because membership in the Royal Family is not a matter of personal attitudes. The Queen's very close (first and second) maternal cousins are not members of the Royal Family, but surely they are the Queen's family. Does it make them royals in any way? No! The Act of Settlement 1701, Sophia Naturalization Act 1705 and the Royal Marriages Act 1772 are those three acts of law which may help us in this problem of who may and who may not be considered in any way, a member of the British Royal Family. By the first act, Dowager Electress Sophia of Hanover and her Protestant descendants were declared to be in the line of succession to the throne. Sophia, a granddaughter of James I of England, was not considered to be an Englishwoman as she had not been born in England. However, the second Act naturalized her and \"the issue of her body\" as English subjects. Naturalization was restricted to Protestants. However, any person born to a descendant of Sophia could also claim to be the \"issue of her body\". And finally, The Royal Marriages Act 1772 is an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain which prescribes the conditions under which members of the British Royal Family may contract a valid marriage, in order to guard against marriages that could diminish the status of the Royal House. The Act said that no descendant of George II, male or female, other than the issue of princesses who had married or might thereafter marry \"into foreign families\", could marry without the consent of the reigning monarch. Thus, those who are in force of the act, the descendants of George II, with an exception of the issue of princessses married with foreign princes, may be considered members of the Royal Family, as well as British subjects (under the Sophia Naturalization Act) and pretenders to the throne (under the Settlement Act). And I think this acts, who does not apply to the Duchess of Conrwall's children and grandchildren, do not exclude them from the Royal Family, but they surely suggest who should be considered a member.\nThe Duchess of Conrwall's family is also the family of her husband, that's obvious, but it does not mean they are members of the Royal Family, which is something much larger and a semi-official body. The RF is a personal family of the Prince of Wales, but in the way they are commonly descnded from the Sovereign, and that's what distinguishes them from the Duchess of Conrwall's family.\nAnd the suggestion that because the Duke of Cambridge thinks of his step-mother's children as siblings makes them \"royal\" in any way is just ridiculous.","105":"213.1.45.14: Syphilis and malaria\n213.1.45.14: At least the malaria \"cure\" has some obvious logic to its working - bleeding does not.\nAre there any other examples of one disease being used to cure another?","106":"Giovanni Giove:  Deleted another nationalistic POV \nDirector: Yes, but what Bishop is saying is that it is not relevant for the article.

Scientists use observations, hypotheses and deductions to propose explanations for natural phenomena in the form of theories. Predictions from these theories are tested by experiment. If a prediction turns out to be correct, the theory survives. This is a meritocratic form of systematic enquiry, where the best ideas supported by evidence and positive experimental results survive. All scientific theories are falsifiable; that is, if evidence that contradicts any given theory comes to light, or if the theory is proven to no longer fit with the evidence, the theory itself is shown to be invalid. Evolution is a theory that fits in with all known biological evidence, fits in with all known genetic evidence, and is backed up by overwhelming evidence in the fossil record. It is also important to note that there is no 'debate' within scientific circles as to whether evolution is a fact or not. It is only in the public sphere, where young earth creationists (especially in America) have fought for recognition of their world view, that the debate about creationism and evolution rages.''\nDo you know what this is?

Ratel, we don't take disputes to ArbComm just like that. There is a whole process, and ArbComm is the last stop on the line. (Well, there is another stop, called StartYourOwnDamnWiki. But hardly anyone goes there. Andyvphil is irritating, but, yes, a short comment period doesn't necessarily establish consensus, but it can certainly show lack of it. There is no consensus at this point for the insertion of *some* of the material proposed, and there is indeed, as Osbojos points out, an increased level of verifiability necessary for controversial claims with the biographies of living persons. But we can't say what tomorrow's consensus will be, no door is closed. \"Edit warring\" to remove controversial material from a BLP, as long as it is at all reasonable, and definitely Ratel's position is within that territory, isn't likely to result in block unless it is clearly contrary to consensus. Edit warring in the other direction is much more likely to be blocked. So, given this, I'd suggest everyone relax. If someone wants to continue to rant and rave and foam at the mouth, well, eventually the dog-catcher will arrive and take him away. Whatever side he's on. The article protection can be extended if needed, and it does not prevent improvement of the article. What we can agree on here can rather easily be incorporated. What is over is the possibility that simply by reverting enough times, one can control the text, at least for part of a day. To Andyvphil, if you want to improve the text from your point of view, there is a clear path: first of all, be civil and polite. I like Bill Moyers, but not enough to support concealing anything verifiable  and balanced  about him. Insulting other editors is not a great idea if you are trying to find consensus with them. Seek consensus, with civility, and you might be able to accomplish something more than just getting yourself blocked.  \nRatel: Right, since Abd feels all editors must agree to obtain consensus (which is clearly not going to happen here), I'll succinctly put my objections to the main remaining issues: 1) the inclusion of the condemnatory words by the Church Committee (CC) and 2) the Deke DeLoach (DD) seating affair.\nThe CC's words related to the actions of ''many'' people over ''many'' years. As far as I know, none of the WP pages relating to these people carry the CC judgements, so why should the Moyers page, unless a POV is getting pushed?\nThe DD affair about convention seating amounts to a relatively ''unknown'' incident that DD ''claims'' happened. Now immediately that raises red flags: we are not supposed to be reporting little known facts on BLP pages, especially so if the fact is derogatory. If you don't know that, you ought to read the rules more carefully. And quite apart from that, the page on Regnery Publishing shows that it is simply a right wing front organisation e.g., the same people who published the Swift Boat smear. Read the Regnery Publishing talk page. Everyone knows that Regnery is one of the major purveyors of books by right-wing attack dogs like Anne Coulter and G. Gordon Liddy. What they choose to publish about one of their greatest enemies, Moyers, is not for inclusion here, when it comes only from one man, Deke Deloach, who only became deputy director of the FBI in 1965 (so he was not \"#3 at the time\"), and who, according to Ronald Kessler in ''The Bureau: The Secret History of the FBI'', once attempted to blackmail Senator Carl T. Hayden. This is not a reliable source. And even if by some miracle this incident actually did happen, it is simply not notable ''prima facie'', because Moyers was merely a conduit for LBJ's orders, and because the order was not enacted.

However, this is the problem: The government of Venezuela controls all media outlets in the country, directly or indirectly. The government when they publish a verdict only publish their decision to DENY the request from the defense, but they do not publish what that request from the defense was. The only way to find out what the request of the defense was, which the government's judge turned down, is to (1) read the docket as filed, why I provided the docket number, or (2) go to non-traditional media, i.e., blogs and the like. The rules for verifiability are consistent with this use. Remember that Wikipedia should be accurate, that is first and foremost. To allow the censorship efforts of the government of Venezuela to make Wikipedia inaccurate and unreliable is counter to the objective, and we as responsible editors must not allow that to happen. There is no problem with calling the attention to the fact that the source is openly biased - it is - but that doesn't make it unreliable. What is unreliable is, however, all the state-controlled media in Venezuela, and the government of Venezuela. Yet they are used as sources on Wikipedia, which obviously is equally objectionable. TeleSur, for instance, is a pure propaganda outlet, yet according to a formal interpretation of the Wikipedia:RS it is a major news outlet and should be accepted as reliable (Telesur is run by Ch\u00e1vez's minister of information).

","235":"Bcorr: Almost three years ago I was able to help a number of different editors with very different opinions and understandings of the violence in Gujarat in 2002. based on that experience, I am offering to help and making a proposal about a way forward. In the interim I have served as a member of and the chair of the Mediation Committee. I am making this proposal as an informal, unofficial mediation \u2014 not as part of the standard Wikipedia dispute resolution process.\nHere is my proposal for moving forward over the next week:\n'''First, I'm proposing a five-day period for working on a new version of the article that will be based on common agreement''' \u2014\u2013 it won't be comprehensive or final, but the goal is that it will serve as the core around which future editing and writing can take place. I will place that article on a temporary page. During that period, I will ask that people continue to refrain from editing the 2002 Gujarat violence article and instead work on the new article on the temporary page.\nAssuming feedback on this proposal is generally positive over the next 48 hours, '''the five days will begin two days from now at this time (4 p.m. EST on 9 Aug 2006\/21:00 UTC on 9 Aug 2006\/2:30 in New Delhi on 10 Aug 2006).''' At the end of the five days, I will move the new article to 2002 Gujarat violence and begin with that.\n'''Second, in the new article, I am asking that contributors only add content that ''they believe that all contributors will agree with.''''' If there is disagreement, I am asking that contributors discuss that on the talk page for the temporary article  not on this page  Talk:2002 Gujarat violence. I am also asking that contributors refrain from removing content that they disagree with, but instead allow me to make suggestions about how to handle disagreements  remembering that my goal is to create something that we can all agree on as a basis for making progress on this article. I will note that this will involve some judgment calls on may part when it comes to deciding how much of the article is devoted to the \"some people say X, while others say Y\" content  I ask that people go along with me for the time being. I will add any disputed facts, sources, or links to a section of the talk page for the temporary article.\n'''Third, I am proposing the following guidelines for editing and for the talk pages:'''\n'''Editing'''\n1. Sign all posts to the talk page.\n2. Avoid characterizing the politics, motives, POV, or objectivity of material added to the article. Simple explain what you disagree with and why you disagree based on accuracy or that it disagrees with your point of view and then explain briefly what yours is.\n3. Avoid extrapolation of the above, e.g., \"X supports Y, so if X says ___, it must be\u2026\"\n4. Work from the assumption for the five-day period that no one has a monopoly on the truth, even if one is certain that facts or evidence is 100 percent clear.\n'''Talk pages'''\n1. Refrain from personal attacks.\n2. Refrain from characterizing the politics, motives, POV, or objectivity of other contributors.\nObviously this is all voluntary, but I believe this is a way that we can all move forward and create an article that is NPOV, factual, informative, and still reflects the differences in opinions and the interpretations of the facts.\n'''Please respond below this line.'''

Fingers crossed.    -","240":"TJive: I just finished reading the actual article in question, and not only is Mr. Huntington being misrepresented, he is being plagiarized.\nHuntington's basis thesis is that for a brief period while the Cold War was winding up the world entered a unipolar state where the US could assert its policy with a bare minimum of resistance, but this time quickly passed in favor of a \"uni-multipolar\" world where the US attempts to set the agenda and regional powers undermine it without taking a formal step towards coalescing against the strongest power.  He implicitly and explicitly recommends reassessing US policy the better to focus on key national interests rather than attempting to universalize American values, giving nods to Brzezinski and the Bismarckian tradition.  With respect to realistic advice for American foreign policy this is not only ''not'' representative of neo-conservatism but the furthest thing from it.\nNow, take this paragraph from the contested passage;\nTo reassert its status in the post-Cold War world, the United States has attempted or been perceived as attempting more or less unilaterally to do the following: pressure other countries to adopt U.S. values and practices regarding neoliberal economic policy and \"human rights\"; promote U.S. corporate interests by supporting policies of \"free trade\" and \"open markets\"; shape International Monetary Fund and World Bank policies to serve those interests; pressure other countries to adopt economic policies and social policies that will benefit U.S. interests; intervene in local conflicts in which it has little direct interest on the surface; grade countries according to their adherence to U.S. standards on \"free markets,\" \"terrorism,\" \"human rights,\" drugs, and weapons proliferation; enforce U.S. law extraterritorially in other societies; apply sanctions against countries that do not meet U.S. standards on these issues; prevent other countries from acquiring military capabilities that could counter U.S. conventional superiority; promote the interests of U.S. arms producers such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Raytheon, abroad while attempting to prevent comparable sales by other countries; expand NATO to the borders of the former Soviet Union; force out one United Nations Secretary-General and dictate the appointment of his successor; categorize certain countries as \"rogue states,\" excluding them from international institutions because of their strained relations with Washington; and undertake military action against Iraq and later maintain harsh economic sanctions against the government of Saddam Hussein.\nAs well as this from Huntington:\nAmerican foreign policy is in considerable measure driven by such beliefs. In the past few years the United States has, among other things, attempted or been perceived as attempting more or less unilaterally to do the following: pressure other countries to adopt American values and practices regarding human rights and democracy; prevent other countries from acquiring military capabilities that could counter American conventional superiority; enforce American law extraterritorially in other societies; grade countries according to their adherence to American standards on human rights, drugs, terrorism, nuclear proliferation, missile proliferation, and now religious freedom; apply sanctions against countries that do not meet American standards on these issues; promote American corporate interests under the slogans of free trade and open markets; shape World Bank and International Monetary Fund policies to serve those same corporate interests; intervene in local conflicts in which it has relatively little direct interest; bludgeon other countries to adopt economic policies and social policies that will benefit American economic interests; promote American arms sales abroad while attempting to prevent comparable sales by other countries; force out one U.N. secretary-general and dictate the appointment of his successor; expand NATO initially to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic and no one else; undertake military action against Iraq and later maintain harsh economic sanctions against the regime; and categorize certain countries as \"rogue states,\" excluding them from global institutions because they refuse to kowtow to American wishes.\nRather than deferring to Huntington as the author of what the US has \"attempted or been perceived as attempting....to do\", the selection merely copies his assertions with the derisory addition of quotes to the phrases \"free markets\", \"human rights\", and \"terrorism\" which attempts to legitimate the theft of content in its selectivity of direct attribution.

It is by no means clear to me that it is that controversial, by the way.

The '''FBI''' reports that it did not rely on  Ross for advice whatsoever during '''the standoff''', but that it did interview and received input from him. Ross also telephoned the '''FBI''' on '''March 27 and March 28''', offering advice about negotiation strategies, suggesting that the FBI \"attempt to embarrass Koresh by informing other members of the compound about Koresh's faults and failures in life, in order to convince them that Koresh was not the prophet they had been led to believe\". The ATF also contacted Ross in January 1993 for information about Koresh.\nPatricia Ryan, president of the Cult Awareness Network, was quoted by the Houston Chronicle as saying, \"Officials should use whatever means necessary to arrest Koresh, including lethal force.\"\nSeveral writers have documented the pivotal role the Cult Awareness Network had upon the government's decision making concerning WacoZulaika, J. and W.A.

The term  seems to mostly come up in the context of European diplomacy - I haven't read any works on the domestic affairs of  Wallachia and  Moldavia.  I personally don't recall any works that use \"Romanian Principalities,\" which strikes me as a somewhat anachronistic term, since the people weren't commonly referred to as \"Romanian\" until rather later, as I understand it.  I'm  willing to  accept that \"Danubian Principalities\" tends to be used for the 18th\/early 19th centuries, but I don't really know about this one way or another, because that's the period I've  read about.  It seems to me that the term  \"Danubian Principalities\" makes sense largely to refer to the role these  principalities played in European international politics, and perhaps in their relationship to the Sublime Porte, but it's hard to distinguish.  As far  as Transylvania, I think we should be careful.  Iirc, he  Transylvanian Diet recognized  three nationalities - Magyars, Szeklers, and Saxons.  Romanians had no representation, and Transylvania as a principality was pretty Hungarian-oriented,  except for the very brief  Michael the Brave period. Its history has also been tremendously different from that of the other two principalities.   So I  think we ought to be careful there.   I  don't oppose in principle a move to Romanian Principalities,  but I'd like to  see some more sources cited about what terms are  in common usage in English.

In the interim I have served as a member of and the chair of the Mediation Committee. I am making this proposal as an informal, unofficial mediation \u2014 not as part of the standard Wikipedia dispute resolution process.\nHere is my proposal for moving forward over the next week:\n'''First, I'm proposing a five-day period for working on a new version of the article that will be based on common agreement''' \u2014\u2013 it won't be comprehensive or final, but the goal is that it will serve as the core around which future editing and writing can take place. I will place that article on a temporary page. During that period, I will ask that people continue to refrain from editing the 2002 Gujarat violence article and instead work on the new article on the temporary page.\nAssuming feedback on this proposal is generally positive over the next 48 hours, '''the five days will begin two days from now at this time (4 p.m. EST on 9 Aug 2006\/21:00 UTC on 9 Aug 2006\/2:30 in New Delhi on 10 Aug 2006).'''

If there is disagreement, I am asking that contributors discuss that on the talk page for the temporary article  not on this page  Talk:2002 Gujarat violence. I am also asking that contributors refrain from removing content that they disagree with, but instead allow me to make suggestions about how to handle disagreements  remembering that my goal is to create something that we can all agree on as a basis for making progress on this article. I will note that this will involve some judgment calls on may part when it comes to deciding how much of the article is devoted to the \"some people say X, while others say Y\" content  I ask that people go along with me for the time being. I will add any disputed facts, sources, or links to a section of the talk page for the temporary article.\n'''Third, I am proposing the following guidelines for editing and for the talk pages:'''\n'''Editing'''\n1. Sign all posts to the talk page.\n2. Avoid characterizing the politics, motives, POV, or objectivity of material added to the article. Simple explain what you disagree with and why you disagree based on accuracy or that it disagrees with your point of view and then explain briefly what yours is.\n3. Avoid extrapolation of the above, e.g., \"X supports Y, so if X says ___, it must be\u2026\"\n4. Work from the assumption for the five-day period that no one has a monopoly on the truth, even if one is certain that facts or evidence is 100 percent clear.\n'''Talk pages'''\n1. Refrain from personal attacks.\n2. Refrain from characterizing the politics, motives, POV, or objectivity of other contributors.\nObviously this is all voluntary, but I believe this is a way that we can all move forward and create an article that is NPOV, factual, informative, and still reflects the differences in opinions and the interpretations of the facts.\n'''Please respond below this line.'''

For example, a strobe light may put out the same amount of energy in 1\/1000th of a second that a floodlight puts out in ten seconds... but for that thousandth of a second its illuminance will be ten thousand times higher.

The primary part of NPOV which applies to this article discussion is Achieving neutrality. It has headings like \"Article structure\", \"Due and undue weight\", and so on. That policy says that all significant points of view '''must''' be included. \"Articles must not take sides, but should explain the sides, fairly and without bias.

Another POV, for example, is the one that says this gun had an easier trigger pull, and that the frequency of guns being were drawn increased after the department bought them. In other words, that the gun did matter, and that not all guns are the same. That POV is significant, as shown by the large number of gun publications and even gun articles on Wikipedia.

Firstly Salafism (as the identified movement we know now) was barely existent during the time of the Ottoman empire, let alone be a considerable force to be reckoned with. Secondly, the unacademic conflation between Salafism (as the Egpytian originating reformist movement assocaited with figures such as Muhammad Abduh and company which spawned in the post-colonialist atmosphere of the late 19th Cent.) and the Wahhabi movement in 18th Cent. arabia (in a region which quite ''literally'' had no Ottoman territorial control) is intellectually flawed and embarrassing to even read. Moreover, to compare Salafism to Kharajiteism is another logical fallacy, they are antithetical to each other in terms of creed (the defining aspect of kharajites is their belief that great sins are tantamount to kufr, whereas this is not the case in Sunni Islam (and salafism). Furthermore, Salafis revere the Salaf, whereas some of the Kharajites even went so far as killing some of the companions of the Prophet (SAWS) such as Uthman (RA). In fact, modern day salafi scholars have written volumes on refuting what they percieve to be modern day kharajites! It is actually mind boggling how anyone can consider the two as being remotely similar. Muhammed Ibn Abdul Wahhab rh is a considerable influence on the Salafi movement as it exists today, however the premise that salafis follow Ibn Abdul Wahhab rh more than the Salaf is nonsensical - the movement ascribes to the works of Ibn Taymiyyah rh (who is by far a more influential figure) who predates Ibn Abdul Wahhab by about 500 to 600 years. In fact there are many points of contrast between these two figures. It is worthy of note that both of these key figures were Sunni Hanbali scholars, even more cemeting the position that Salafism is quite clearly a Sunni movement.

Dunbar H. Ogden (UC Berkeley) and Robert K. Sarlos (UC Davis). Neither had heard the term diegesis. My old theater history professor, A. M. Nagler, never used the term.\nSo I hit the dictionaries. The American Heritage, Miriam Webster, and Cambridge advanced on-line dictionaries omit the word. The six dictionaries consulted that did list the word all defined it, tersely, as \u201ca narrative.\u201d My own copy of the OED defined it almost identically and found only one brief citation to quote \u2013 from the mid 19th century. Deduction: the word may be most politely characterized as obscure and little used \u2013 at least until it was repeatedly revived, appropriated and re-positioned by post-modern critics of all major schools.\nNext, I read closely the relevant sections from Plato and Aristotle, in the translations cited by the Wikipedia article. The term is used only as \u201cnarrative,\u201d (although Prof. Gilbert Murray explains that the greek roots really mean \u201cthrough-going\u201d). Footnote 2, included in the article, says, in part, ''\u201cCertainly, he replied. \/ And narration may be either simple narration, or imitation, or a union of the two? \/ [...] \/ And this assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice or gesture, is the imitation of the person whose character he assumes? \/ Of course. \/ Then in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed by way of imitation? \/ Very true. \/'' Unmistakably, imitation can be a part of epic poetry, which, like motion pictures, is reported to an audience rather than created in front of it.\nThen I re-read the Wikipedia article and all the above discussion. As before, I found it a frustrating mess of inconsistent statements unsupported by citations. The most conservative conclusion is that diegesis is an old, fairly simple term that is being Humpty-Dumptied by anyone who wants to use it. Since that\u2019s a usual and customary critical process, there\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with it.\nBut an encyclopedia\u2019s charge is to report information and meaning, not to create, modify, or debate it. Since \u201cdiegesis\u201d in its modern incarnations may well be no more than ephemeral jargon, all we should do is note its existence, explain its classical meaning and usage, and report its revival, transformations, and presently unsettled status.\nWith that in mind, I think the current article should be replaced with a new one more appropriate to an encyclopedia. \nDionysosProteus:  Consult the literature. It's there in black and white. If you have difficultly accepting that, no one can help you. ipse dixit my arse. You didn't read Aristotle? You passed over genre? Elam sound familiar?

This ''was'' only temporary control, certainly until the UN brokered the peace by which they would be recognized as the boundaries between national control. It's very simple: when the Israeli military (or, conversely, the Jordanian military, if you like) crossed the boundaries for the territory that had been allocated to the Jewish state (Palestinian state), it was expanded the territory under its control. It was ''not'' expanding its internationally recognized borders; the UN, rather than recognizing the military advances, could have said, \"everyone go back home, where home means what was allocated to you under the partition plan.\" (Yes, I know; the UN would never do anything that required that much spine, but they do have the authority to do it.) It was only when the UN recognized the armistice lines that it can be said that the internationally recognized borders of Israel\/the Jewish State were expanded. \nTegwarrior, you edit makes it look as if the Palestinian refugee issue has one clear cut reason.

","442":"Spitzak: It may be useful to add indicators to broken charset detectors that cause people to think the BOM is necessary to identify UTF-8. A broken detector is one that does not test for UTF-8 first using pattern matching, and returns UTF-8 if and only if that succeeds. This works due to the fact that valid UTF-8 is a significantly tiny subset of all possible byte sequences, thus a pattern match is an extremely reliable detector.\nThe most obvious broken detector is the Bush hid the facts one in Windows, which tests for UTF-16LE first, then apparently checks for one-byte \"legacy code page\" encodings. It is not clear if it *ever* checks for UTF-8 other than making sure the first three bytes are the UTF-8 encoding of BOM.\nThe Mozilla example was cited as one that does it correctly. Referenced document  seems to indicate this though it is not clear. The paragraph on coding patterns sort-of identifies it: an invalid sequence immediately says this is *not* UTF-8. However it also requires a \"threshold\" of multi-byte characters to exist. This may just mean a threshold at which it aborts without checking the entire text, which is ok. However the text seems to imply that a certain number of multibyte characters must be found for a positive result. This theshold should be one, or zero if the only 7-bit character set it can return is ASCII (because ASCII is UTF-8 and therefore if there are no 8-bit characters the file is UTF-8). The document is also not very clear if passing this test forces UTF-8 to be detected, or if other tests could somehow \"weigh\" higher, that would also be broken.\n \nStrebe: Thanks for your efforts, .

This article has been down this route before and all it results in is uncited listcruft that attracts more cruft.

Unless the fact these people were famous or notable ''because'' of their left-handedness there is little point to the list.\n The major source of your famous people appears to be a student's webpage.  This is not a reputable source for this information and is clearly incorrect in significant places.  Please link for me a single photograph that demonstrates Einstein left-handedness.  I think you will find all show Einstein favouring his right.  Picasso was also not left-handed, though it is an often repeated myth.\n \"left-handed people tend to be heavily over-represented in history\" - where does this statement of fact come from?  I would be interested to hear how it was determined.\n \"87 percent of the adult population is right-handed\" - Why did you replace cited figures with this uncited statement?  It contradicts the figures given in the very next paragraph.\n \"left-handed people tend to be overrepresented among the most intelligent and successful\" - where is this statement supported?  Again, how was it determined?\n The information you added was initially uncited.

That is why I think that \"boolean\", meaning true or false, is specific to computer programming. The reader who does not know that meaning of \"boolean\" is left helpless. That the hypothesis is true or false can be written H=true or H=false, without using the word \"boolean\". But why is it essential that there are only two possibilities? The degree of confidence of V=1, V=2 and V=3 makes perfectly sense. (See Bayesian inference#Distribution of a parameter of the hypergeometric distribution).\nI am not particularly concerned over the use of a single word. However, I still feel it is a very well known term, particularly for the likely audience of this article. Maybe I am wrong about that. The reason that H is a boolean is because H \u2261 \"V=1\". The notation in  Bayesian inference#Distribution of a parameter of the hypergeometric distribution is slightly misleading in that the probability actually being calculated is P(H|k), where H \u2261 \"K=1\" etc. As I understand it, that is the Bayesian interpretation of probability - confidence in the truth or falsehood of a hypothesis.  \n''confidence'': Bayesian_probability#Calculations_with_Bayesian_probabilities explains that \"some of the probabilities are interpreted as representing beliefs\". Bayesian inference is difficult to grasp when everything is called ''probability''. The probabilities representing beliefs should be called something else, such as ''degree of confidence''. That is what we were trying to do in  bayesian inference. We should not call  P(H|E) the ''posterior probability'', but rather the ''degree of confidence'' in the hypothesis, H, after taking the evidence, E, into account.

The text of the article doesn\u2019t keep referring to \u201cperjury\u201d without any indication as to precisely ''what'' it was Aitken did that constituted perjury; the text doesn't leave the reader to trawl through the citations to locate the facts of the offending, nor does the corresponding Talk page contain any suggestion that the contributors should have left that to the reader.\nWe haven\u2019t limited the detail of Aiken\u2019s offending to \u201cperjury\u201d, and the Mick Philpott article doesn't keep referring to the \u201cmanslaughter of six children\u201d without telling us ''what'' was manslaughter \u2013 the starting of the fire etc.\nSo, why the discrepancy between our description of perjury, or manslaughter, and our non-description of indecent assault?\nIn the case of perjury, manslaughter or murder we detail the offence rather than recording it simply as \"the manslaughter of a fifteen-year-old\" or \"an act of perjury in ''x'' court of law\"; whereas in the case of indecent assault, the offence is not described, and is recorded simply as \"indecent assault\" against somebody of ''x'' age.\nWhat WP policy is being used here? I've been unable to locate it - and I trawled through a lot of policy before asking again! \nDeCausa: Firstly, there isn't a policy specifically for every point of detail. We rely on an article-by-article consensus for which facts are included. The level of detail on the crimes you mention will depend on the particular circumstances of the article and the local consensus. I don't see how you would lay down a policy that dictates the same level of detail in all cases. If you wish to pursue that, then somewhere like Village Pump is the place to raise it, not here. This page is about the specifics of this article and per WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS, what goes on elsewhere is not particularly relevant. Looking at the level of detail in this article, I don't see the point of adding more. This is an encyclopedia article not a newspaper; detailed accounts of sexual offences can appear prurient and tabloid-like. If you want to put forward a case for more detail, then do so and consensus will determine the result. But just saying other articles have more detail is a poor argument that is unlikely to be successful. Also, I suggest you drop your frequent remarks that editors are making editing choices because they are male. Apart from it being a potential breach of WP:NPA that kind of crude gender stereotyping looks particularly silly when all you've got to go on are pseudonymous account names (which may be misleading).

Knowing that you have been a significant contributor to the article wiki_link, perhaps you could provide an alternate opinion. Even though it wasn't the first or deadliest school shooting, I still believe it was a very notable event that affected the nation and world in many ways in the year 2008 (gun politics, higher education, mental health, journalism ethics, video game politics, emergency preparedness, etc.). I even backed it up with three international sources (from Australia and the U.K.), which I felt demonstrated the event's global importance. Unfortunately, people disagreed with that. Mind you, the event had been listed in that article all year, and only did it become a problem when I tried to add an image on the article recently. I stopped trying to put the image on there, but then they outright deleted the text entry about the event, which I thought was very uncalled for, and utterly ridiculous, considering it was perhaps one of the biggest media events of the year. Perhaps you could help revert this senseless deletion of a notable entry and provide some input on the wiki_link. Thanks for your help! \nHuskyHuskie: Regrettably, I feel that this simply demonstrates how inane it is to have articles on years and decades.  I agree with you that it was a noteworthy event, but such things are infinitely subjective, and (I feel) not worth the effort needed to wage the battle.  I would rather be Don Quixote and take on the ''existence of the article wiki_link''.  I mean, what makes ''this'' year particularly noteworthy?  I think that 1989, 1848, and 1776 are all exceptional years, and more worthy of an article than, say, 1922.  We don't provide every author an article just because he wrote a book, and we don't give every American mayor an article, even if he is re-elected three times.  We are supposed to touch upon the ''noteworthy''.  The NIU shooting is more notable than many events in wiki_link, but wiki_link is not worth the time of day to me (at least, not yet.

We'll all grant him that his \"decipherment\" makes more sense than what you'd expect of one of the 1080 or so possible readings chosen at random. Let's grant him that his decipherment is 1020 better than expected by chance. That means that he may have found one of the 1060 best solutions (only one of which is of course correct). The other thing is his proud conclusion that his decipherment forces us to reconsider most of what we know of Bronze Age history and linguistics, not recognizing, apparently, that it was rather he being forced to bend some very well established facts in order to justify his reading. This is not so much a sensational outcome but a glaring weakness.

I have seen the article linked to and the aggregate cited in several forums, thereby warranting its inclusion.\n2. It does not raise POV issues, it is simply one mathematical manner of calculating a ranking from infrequently released surveys. This does not make it biases, it simply makes it one imperfect manner in which to analyze the data.\n3. The removal was conducted with no community feedback or input by a user who expressed their opinion and then took over the page. If a chart feature that has been included in the article for years (I have referenced this page for at least four) is to be removed, it should be done so through editorial consensus.\nWe've been through the math on this one multiple times. The fact that its an odd statistic to calculate doesn't demand that we don't. A better solution would be to identify alternative mathematical means by which to analyze the data and add additional columns calling out their methodology. But until that is done, the existing column has been a widely accepted and legitimate way to quantify the table's data.\nBefore removing again, please get community support.
