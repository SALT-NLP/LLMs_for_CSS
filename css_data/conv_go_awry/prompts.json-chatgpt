    "0": "Sitush:  Vidya Prakash Tyagi \nSitush: The above author is used as a source for some pretty contentious statements in this article. I've been reading the preview version of the book cited on and off over the last 24 hours and I've got quite a few issues with it. Principally, though:\n there are loads of misprints, including sentences that are not completed & could therefore cause confusion/ambiguity etc (I do not include typos/grammar in this description as it is \"Indian English\")\n aside from a lot of bookshops selling the thing, and the usual publicity blurbs etc, I can find nothing to indicate that the author is notable, that the work has been peer-reviewed etc. Anyone can get a book published.\nAre we sure about the reliability of this as a source? Is the author an academic or what? Is the publisher known for producing books of a worthy standard? For those unfamiliar with the issue of reliable sources etc, please read WP:RS. Thanks. -   \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack?  \n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either \"True\" or \"False\" with without using any other words.\n"
