52	True	True. According to the Manual of Style (MOS) for Wikipedia, trivia sections are generally discouraged. The MOS recommends that information should be incorporated into the article's main text, rather than being relegated to a separate section. This is because trivia sections can be seen as a dumping ground for random or tangential information, and they can detract from the overall quality of the article. However, there may be exceptions to this guideline depending on the context and content of the information. As for the second part of your question, I cannot predict the future and whether a conversation will devolve into personal attacks.
