52	True	True. According to the Manual of Style (MOS) for Wikipedia, trivia sections are generally discouraged. The MOS recommends that information should be incorporated into the article's main text, rather than being relegated to a separate section. This is because trivia sections can be seen as a dumping ground for random or tangential information, and they can detract from the overall quality of the article. However, there may be exceptions to this guideline depending on the context and content of the information. As for the second part of your question, I cannot predict the future and whether a conversation will devolve into personal attacks.
53	False	False. While it is important to avoid personal attacks, the conversation need not be limited to just "True" or "False" responses. It is possible to engage in a respectful and productive conversation that involves more nuanced discussion and exploration of different viewpoints.

Dahiya, and Edgar Knobloch, identify them with the Great Yuezhi, a tribe that lived in what is now China during the same time period.&&&&&&&&&&&&The Utigurs were a Turkic tribe that lived in the 5th and 6th centuries CE. Their origin is also not completely clear, but some scholars, such as Edwin G. Pulleyblank, Yury Zuev, and modern Bulgarian scholars, identify them as one of the tribes of the Yuezhi.&&&&&&&&&&&&According to Pulleyblank and Zuev, the Utigurs of Menandr are Uti, and the word Uti was a real proto-type of a transcription Yuezhi < Uechji < ngiwat-tie < uti.&&&&&&&&&&&&The Huns and proto-Bulgarians practiced artificial cranial deformation, and its circular type can be used to trace the route that the Huns took from north China to the Central Asian steppes and subsequently to the southern Russian steppes. Circular modification appeared for the first time in Central Asia in the last centuries BCE as an ethnic attribute of the early Huns. The people who practiced annular artificial cranial deformation in Central Asia were Yuezhi/Kushans. Some of the artificially deformed skulls found in Northeastern Hungary during the 5th–6th century AD (Hun-Germanic Period) were found to belong to the Europid "great race," but further identification was impossible.
