    "0": "CJ Withers: The text of the Heterosexism article is not a place for anti-LGBT linguistic activism, i.e. eliminating \"LGBT\" where it is correct. Whereas you object to \"queer\" with or without its negative uses, you embrace \"homosexual\" while turning a blind eye to its ambiguous status due to negative uses and connotations (medicalization, anti-gay linguistic practice, etc.). How contradictory. Please take your beefs with language change to some forum as this article and the LGBT series template are not a sounding boards for your emotional bias. Removing \"LGBT\" in this article is erasure and constitutes vandalism. What's more, doing so under the guise of \"consistency\" removes all good faith.  \n7Kim:  I'm going to refer you to WP:MASTODONS, just as I did  above, and additionally WP:AGF and WP:NPA.  In my opinion, accusing another editor being anti-LGBT (i.e., accusing that editor of homophobia) is crossing a very serious line, particularly when you offer no real evidence that the target of your accusation is motivated by opposition to homosexuality or gay culture itself and no such motivation is immediately self-evident in that editor's commentary.  Really, is this an issue that merits this level of vitriol?  If so, I would have to say that it takes two to tango and any strong emotional investment you may have in the label LGBT is as likely to contribute to the conflict as any other editor's imputed bias.\n To offer a constructive outcome, may I suggest another route to resolving the conflict? Rather than arguing over replacing \"LGBT\" with \"homosexual\", which does not appear to offer any possible outcome upon which we can form consensus, can we then address the other side of the equation and replace \"heterosexual\" with \"straight\"?  This would resolve what I see as the valid kernel of 's objection (preserving clarity and consistency by contrasting a cultural-identity label to a cultural-identity label), and it does so without giving the appearance of indulging in \"erasure\".    \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack? \nTrue\nFalse\n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either True or False with without using any other words.\n",

Per Wikipedia's policy on verifiability, ''any unsourced information can be removed''.

Altaic has no initial consonant clusters, while Hunno-Bulgarian does. Unlike Turkic and Mongolian, Hunno-Bulgarian language has no initial dental or velar spirants. Unlike Turkic, it has initial voiced b-: bagatur (a title), boyla (a title). Unlike Turkic, Hunno-Bulgarian has initial n-, which is also encountered in Mongolian: Negun, Nebul (proper names). In sum, Antoaneta Granberg concludes that Hunno-Bulgarian language  has no consistent set of features that unite it with either Turkic or Mongolian.

But the more research I do, the more it looks like we were lied to.  At the very least, the commission report was rushed, is inaccurate, and was doctored.  Even the 911 hero, William Rodriguez, who personally saved 15 people and went back into the buildings 3 more times and was then trapped the wreckage had his testimony regarding \"hearing explosions before the collapse\" stricken from the commission report.  He now is personally advocating the reopening of the investigation.  Now that more and more people question the events of that terrible day, the real question is now among us:  \"What do we do now?\"  The answer is to speak your mind, and not be afraid to make your voice heard.  When discussing this topic, remain polite, as we are all Americans after the same goal.  Answers.  This is a core belief issue, and many people simply refuse to even contemplate it.  If you are one of those people, ask yourself why you feel that way?  The other things you can do are to do your own research.  Find out how you can get involved in pursuing the answers.  We don't know what the level of corruption was, but there was definitely a great deal of it going on.  If the worst of these possibilities is true: The highest of our government planned/enabled the attacks for political/financial reasons, then we as responsible Americans MUST NOT turn the other cheek.  We MUST hold them accountable, even if it means America goes down in the history books as having one of the most corrupt governments in modern times.  But the fact that the people questioned it, and were able to make change, and bring the corrupt group to justice will show we are a strong country and a patriotic people, who also care for the world, not just ourselves.  We are a government of, by, and for the people, not the other way around.  Do not fear this issue, but rather question it.  Just like our troops have a duty to protect our country, so do we as a people, have a duty to protect our troops, and our way of life.  To learn more, visit any number of sites on the subject, and decide for yourself.  But while you are deciding, keep an open mind.  Keep in mind, that the Government issues sound bites for the average American to repeat in their basic attempt to justify their viewpoint.  And they do not want you to do any of your own investigation.  They know that many Americans are busy with their lives, and frankly, many are lazy in keeping up with current affairs.  They count on it, in fact.  If you watch a state of the union speech...  you can see just how many times a specific phrase is worked in, because they know the average citizen will be looking for guidance and someone to make up their mind.  It was the first speech after 911 when Bush linked terror to bin laden to Iraq to Saddam Hussein.  This was no coincidence.  Free you minds people, and take responsibility for your citizenship.  Be a proud American... remember, our country is based on the ideas of freedom of thought and speech.  They would have you believe otherwise, by trying to make us feel \"unpatriotic\" by questioning our government.  In fact, telling us we are \"unpatriotic\" is actually unpatriotic. \nYour post sounds dangerously close to soapboxing.

The presiding judges commented that \"this litigation has almost certainly had a chilling effect on public debate which might otherwise have assisted potential patients to make informed choices about the possible use of chiropractic\".''\nThis entry is implicating that the Guardian (and other pseudoscience rejecting media) saw this as only a technical win for Singh (or even worse), and no implication whatsoever on the BCA practices, besides 'opinion'.\nActually the article explicitly and carefully pointed out that his claims where upheld by other bodies, and that this was a victory for Singh. The tone and the content are in fact embracing Singh's words in the book, which is the prominent mainstream view.\nSince Wikipedia has a clear policy about pseudoscience (WP:Fringe), which states: \n... ''and significant-minority views published in reliable sources should be represented fairly and proportionately... \n... ''editors should be careful not to present the pseudoscientific fringe views alongside the scientific or academic consensus as though they are opposing but still equal views. While pseudoscience may in some cases be significant to an article, it should not obfuscate the description or prominence of the mainstream views.''\nPlease return my edit which added: \n''The Guardian noted that Singh had been sued because he had spoken out against chiropractors \"for making claims the Advertising Standards Authority has ruled can no longer be made.\"''\n\nOtherwise, the article is promoting chiropractics, a trait clearly marked in the Wikipedia, and with no doubt, as pseudoscience.  \nPashute: Either way is ok with me.

    "111": "Cadwgan Gedrych:  A serious 2nd postulate discussion (with all rules followed) \nCadwgan Gedrych: Apparently, EMS has simply made up his mind, so there is probably nothing that anyone can do about that, but maybe others can see what EMS cannot, so I will now directly address EMS' above objections:\nOf course the invariance of light's speed would be counterintuitive if found by experiment; EMS misread what I said, so he missed the point entirely, and then held that against me, calling for others to boycott me. What I did say was that a result that is given by man up front by mere definition (and '''not''' by any experiment) is not in the least unexpected or in any way counterintuitive. Einstein ''began'' by presetting his distant clock to read his  prechosen one-way \"time\" x/c, which, of course, results in the clock \"finding\" the value c for \"light's one-way speed.\"\nEMS wrote:\n\"Also, I find this business of needing to do a vary specific test of the second postulate itself to be bogus.\"\nEMS finds it \"to be bogus\" only because (as in the just-given case) EMS simply failed to understand.\nHere is precisely what he failed to understand in this case:\nBefore special relativity, there was Maxwell's equations, but despite being given these equations, every physicist on the face of the Earth firmly predicted a positive (non-null) result for the Michelson-Morley experiment (round-trip light speed ''variance'' with Earth's velocity). Thus, if Einstein had postulated re these equations prior to the MMx, then he would clearly have postulated variance, not invariance, along with every other physicist.  However, Einstein ''did not have to postulate'' pertaining to Maxwell's equations because they (as I just noted) ''pre-existed'' special relativity. Therefore, the second postulate does not postulate regarding Maxwell's equations.\nSimilarly, since the Michelson-Morley null result itself pre-dated special relativity, Einstein did not have to postulate about that result.\nIndeed, in his 1905 relativity paper, Einstein specifically stated that he was simply accepting up front the experimentally-given fact of round-trip isotropy, and was also accepting round-trip invariance (because it was so closely related to the former).\nClearly, this left only '''one''' case about which Einstein could possibly postulate, and that case was the one-way, two-clock light speed case.\nSince all roads lead to the truth, we can arrive at the just-given conclusion by using an entirely different path, as follows:\nLet's say that the second postulate calls for 500 different things, one of which is the invariance and isotropy of light's round-trip, one-clock speed, another of which is the constancy of light's speed c (''not'' measured by a frame's rulers and clocks, but determined by using magnetic and electric fields) in space (as per Maxwell's equations), and yet another of which is the invariance/isotropy of light's one-way speed per transported clocks, and so on, until we reach \"the invariance/isotropy of light's one-way speed per two same-frame clocks.\"\nLet's now assume that 499 of the cases have been closed experimentally, some of them even prior to the creation of special relativity.\nJust as we found above, we are left with only ''one'' case to which special relativity currently applies theoretically, so it is only this ''one'' case that is currently critical as far as the future of special relativity is concerned, despite EMS' above opinion that -\nHe finds this business of needing to do a vary specific test of the second postulate itself to be bogus.\nIn other words, if special relativity does not currently state specifically that light's one-way speed between two same-frame clocks is \"blah-blah-blah,\" then special relativity does not currently make any ''theoretical'' statement about light's speed.\nThe burning question now is What does special relativity state about light's one-way speed between two same-frame clocks?\nDoes special relativity say that if this speed is experimentally measured, that it will be invariant and isotropic?\nIf so, then how can this experiment be performed, and why has it not been performed yet, not even on paper using ideal or perfect clocks and rulers?\nIt should be clear that if an alleged experiment cannot be performed even on paper using perfect instruments, then it cannot be performed in real life, which, of course, is why no one has performed it in real life.\nAnd since no one here has shown how this critical experiment can be performed on paper, much less in real life, no one has shown how to currently test the second postulate re the only case that counts, the one-way, two-clock case.\nThe burning question now becomes Why can't we currently test the second postulate in the only case that currently counts?\nThe answer is as follows:\nBecause the second postulate says absolutely nothing theoretical about light's one-way speed between two same-frame clocks except the following:\n[a] Since absolutely synchronous clocks would yield a variable one-way light speed, and since Einstein's main rule is \"No absolute motion detection by any means,\" we must assume that such clocks cannot be found, even though we cannot prove this negative, and\n[b] we must further assume that clocks are properly set only if they do not allow us to detect out motion through space, even though such clocks will not be absolutely synchronous, but will be absolutely asynchronous.\nNow we can see the second postulate a little more clearly. For example, we can see why the word \"currently\" - as in \"currently test\" - was used above; it is because we ''could'' test the postulate if we could find a way to absolutely synchronize clocks.\nBut we can see a lot more.\nFor example, a blind person can now see the fact that '''all''' two-clock measurements in special relativity are '''incorrect''' due to the absolute asynchronousness of Einstein's clocks.\nThis means that SR's transformation equations are incorrect. It also means that the SR composition (or addition) of velocities theorem is incorrect, as well as all of the other two-clock results such as \"time dilation\" and \"length contraction.\"\nMost of all, it means that the SR \"result\" of one-way light speed \"invariance/isotropy\" is incorrect, so Einstein's prime rule is also incorrect, which, as was noted above, was \"No absolute motion detection can possibly happen by any means.\" This is flatly contradicted  the simple fact that we could easily detect absolute motion (or motion through space) by using a pair of absolutely synchronous clocks to measure light's one-way speed.\nBut we can also see that Einstein did not disprove the Galilean transformation because Einstein did not (and could not) prove that absolutely synchronous clocks cannot exist.\nAnd we can further see that one-way light speed invariance has not only not been shown experimentally, but cannot be shown experimentally because it cannot happen unless it has been given up front artificially (i.e., by man via definition).\nIn conclusion (for now):\nAs long as we cannot absolutely synchronize clocks, we are forced to live with incorrectly related clocks (such as Einstein's), so we are forced to obtain incorrect results, which of course are not valid physics results. However, Einstein's results are the best we can get since he mainly ignores only the actual (and different) light travel times in different frames, and light's speed is very great. But if we could get our hands on a pair of truly synchronous clocks, then we could instantly forget all about special relativity, and go about the much better business of making correct two-clock measurements. For example, as mentioned above, we could easily determine our speed through space by correctly measuring light's passing speed.

However, it took almost 40 years (no exaggeration) to find enough \"proof\" to meet BIA standards to get a Certified Degree of Indian Blood (CDIB) card. After that, getting Cherokee Nation citizenship was easy.\nYears ago, I recall the State of California telling me I could not claim to be of Cherokee ancestry on official forms because I was not a citizen at the time. That was extremely frustrating. Five years later when I was a citizen, the state no longer had that section on their forms.\nI can see omitting people who have made a claim of ancestry, but documentation shows they are not. I have come across many people who \"feel\" they are American Indian, but have no specific details.\nPerhaps the editors who wish to delete some questionable people could contact those people directly to see if they want to be on the list; and if so, could they provide some proof of their claim or the basis of their claim. Then the editors could at least have something to go on.\nFYI, while the Cherokee Nation has approximately 300,000 enrolled citizens, over 750,000 people self-claimed Cherokee ancestry during the most recent census. Many people are familiar with the part of Cherokee history called the Trail of Tears which moved the Cherokees to Indian Territory (Oklahoma) in the 1830s. However, many Cherokees left our ancestral lands decades before the removal. Many settled in what now is Arkansas and Missouri. After the \"Trail,\" The US government took numerous rolls of tribal members. If you did not live in the \"official\" Cherokee lands in Indian Territory, you were not included in those rolls. All of those Cherokees in Arkansas and Missouri (just to name a few, others went to Mexico/Texas, etc.) were not included in most rolls. Presently, the Cherokee Nation's primary requirement to become a citizen is being able to trace your blood ancestry back to anyone listed as Cherokee on the Dawes rolls. It does not matter what your blood-quantum is, just verifiable Cherokee blood. So, if your full-blooded Cherokee grandfather and your full-blooded Cherokee grandmother were not on the rolls, you will not be able to become a citizen of the Cherokee Nation, even if you are full-blooded Cherokee.\nThis all just goes to show that \"proof\" can be hard to come by, and varies from person to person.\nFor disclosure purposes, I am on the list of people being discussed here. Phil Konstantin\nVizjim:  Hi Phil - Great summary of the situation.  In short, this list has been deliberately created so as not to have Wikipedian editors going out and doing genealogical research.  You'll find non-citizen Cherokee writers on this list including Diane Glancy, Kim Shuck, Robert J. Conley and others: I think all three of these are in exactly the situation you describe.  Rather than looking for \"proof,\" the list was set up to accept people's word for their ancestry unless there have been credible proofs by third parties that the claim to indigenous ancestry is incorrect. \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack? \nTrue\nFalse\n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either True or False with without using any other words.\n",

My forefathers were dewellers of village \"Chatala\" in the general area \"Bhatnair\" (we keep our lineage with ourselves and they can be matched against the ones still living there). They converted to Islam at least a century before when Babur entered the sub-continent. During the rule of Ibrahim Lodhi, upon the directions of Sandal Bhatti, the grandfather of famous \"Dulla Bhatti\" (ever heard of him?) my ancestor moved to the general area \"Narowal\" and are there since then.

He has survived across various eras of wrestling and stood in the ring with opponents of all sizes and varied skill-sets, in all types of matches be it Hell In A Cell, Inferno, Casket, etc.\nConsidering the amount of effort which the Undertaker has put more into the business by being locker-room leader, by carrying the torch during the lean years of the WWE, by mentoring other superstars, and also by helping other characters like Kane get derived out of his character and gain superstar-status with a more successful career than earlier - I think it needs to be called out in some or the other form in this article. There is a reason why he is called the \"Phenom\" and the \"Conscience of the WWE\", and why he was voted as the greatest athlete in the history of Raw by the fans - http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/raw15/exclusives/raw15pollresults/\nCan we at least mention some of these facts (not necessarily in the same format as below) in the article's 1st paragraph or in a separate sub-section like \"Popularity\" or \"Wrestling Style and Influence\" or \"General Impression\" or \"Fan/ Peer Opinion\", for which I am also posting reliable-sources:\n He is the locker room leader backstage (a source from a WWF.com interview) - http://get2xtreme.tripod.com/2Xtreme/featarti/fataker5.html (first para).

I will try to find it and post it.\n Another link here from Jim Ross' blog states that in the last 34 years of his career, he has not seen a wrestler who has gained more respect of his peers than the Undertaker - - http://www.jrsbarbq.com/2008/07/11/jr-and-the-king-to-team-againnaitch-on-charlottes-friday-night-smackdown-next-weekuwf-championsdo-internet-message-boards-all-suck/ and  http://www.phenomforever.com/?p=264 (this is a fan-site, however it points to a reliable link on JR's blog).\nLet me know your thoughts on this.   \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack? \nTrue\nFalse\n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either True or False with without using any other words.\n",

It could be called the Da Vinci Code syndrome. It has been applied to many different situations, from Biblical scholars trying to find hidden meanings in the scriptures based on lining the text up a certain way; to micro-inspection of the available JFK assassination video and photos to try to definitively prove (in vain, so far) that there was more than one shooter in Dealey Plaza; to Area 51, the \"top secret\" government testing site that everyone knows about. With Apollo, they started with the premise that NASA lied. They couldn't find any direct evidence of this assertion, however; no one in a position to know has \"confessed\". So, instead, they put on their Sherlock Holmes caps and looked for \"clues\". When they found enough of them to satisfy themselves, they proclaimed they had found \"evidence\" that NASA lied... even though most of their so-called \"clues\" have been shown to be either ignorant or willful misinterpretations of what they were seeing (such as the \"waving flag\" nonsense). Maybe the \"Apollo Code syndrome\" would actually be the better term. \nFor great justice.: I've never seen it said that triangulation could be fooled, nor have I seen any triangulation data.

There would be no pretense to authentic science or technology in such a riff.  It's just fun to think about incorporating ideas from science or technology in bits of fantasy fiction.\nIt turns out that this wasn't an original idea.  There are other suggestions for incorporating Cold Fusion into steampunk stories.\nBut that's not quite what I wanted to talk about here.\nMy personal blog typically draws about 25 hits a day, and yesterday was no exception.  Yesterday's new post on steampunk drew only four direct hits — two hits from referrals on Facebook and two from referrals on one other site where I mentioned it in a  casual discussion thread.\nThat's par for the course. Almost no one ever reads my blog, even when I mention to my correspondents that I've written a new post.\nSo when I mentioned it late yesterday afternoon in IRC to JWSchmidt, he asked me if the Navy's SPAWAR Cold Fusion Cell had actually achieved any significant results, in terms of excess heat or reaction products.  Of course I had no idea, not having read the technical literature on it, so I suggested he just Google up \"SPAWAR Cold Fusion Cell\" to find the official reports.\nImagine our surprise when we discovered that, just 8 hours after having written a silly and whimsical blog post on steampunk (that at best only four or five people had actually read), Google was listing my blog post as the 8th ranked hit on \"SPAWAR Cold Fusion Cell\" even though serious reports on it have been out there for years.\nBut if you think that's weird, try the Bing Search engine where my blog post on Steampunk is now the #2 hit for \"SPAWAR Cold Fusion Cell.\"\nWhat does that tell you about the popularity or importance of the Navy's work on its SPAWAR Cold Fusion Cell?\nMoulton (talk)\nKmarinas86:  \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack? \nTrue\nFalse\n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either True or False with without using any other words.\n",

That is not scorching; that is being over-heated or potentially suffering from heat stroke. That is how it is represented in the movie; not scorching, which is an appropriate word to describe environmental conditions. The film does not establish the time of year.

The term  seems to mostly come up in the context of European diplomacy - I haven't read any works on the domestic affairs of  Wallachia and  Moldavia.  I personally don't recall any works that use \"Romanian Principalities,\" which strikes me as a somewhat anachronistic term, since the people weren't commonly referred to as \"Romanian\" until rather later, as I understand it.  I'm  willing to  accept that \"Danubian Principalities\" tends to be used for the 18th/early 19th centuries, but I don't really know about this one way or another, because that's the period I've  read about.  It seems to me that the term  \"Danubian Principalities\" makes sense largely to refer to the role these  principalities played in European international politics, and perhaps in their relationship to the Sublime Porte, but it's hard to distinguish.  As far  as Transylvania, I think we should be careful.  Iirc, he  Transylvanian Diet recognized  three nationalities - Magyars, Szeklers, and Saxons.  Romanians had no representation, and Transylvania as a principality was pretty Hungarian-oriented,  except for the very brief  Michael the Brave period. Its history has also been tremendously different from that of the other two principalities.   So I  think we ought to be careful there.   I  don't oppose in principle a move to Romanian Principalities,  but I'd like to  see some more sources cited about what terms are  in common usage in English.  \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack? \nTrue\nFalse\n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either True or False with without using any other words.\n",

There is a graphic chart indicating that American usage is to call tortoises turtles. Not so. Americans call tortoises, tortoises; and turtles, turtles.\nThis notion that Americans say 'turtle' for 'tortoise' seems to be a kind of urban legend in Britain. It probably arose because in America fresh-water turtles are far more common, both in the wild and as pets, than tortoises are. Another point of confusion may arise from the unusual circumstance of North American box turtles (species Terrapene carolina; various subspecies). These are fresh-water turtles, the best-known subspecies of which have almost entirely adapted to land. Taxonomically a box turtle is a turtle, but a casual observer unfamiliar with the species may look at its domed carapace and dry feet, and readily assume it to be a tortoise.\nThe article correctly notes that in American usage 'terrapin' is restricted specifically to the true terrapin, while in Britain, where there are no true terrapins, the word is applied loosely to any fresh-water turtle. Thus an American box turtle in Britain might be mistaken for a tortoise or defined as a terrapin, but in reality is neither. \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack? \nTrue\nFalse\n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either True or False with without using any other words.\n",

    "209": "Old wombat: An important improvement that is not mentioned is that a termcap definition was conceptually a single line. So when you wrote it out over multiple lines, you had to have backslashes in all but the last line, and the total number of characters (including all whitespaces) you were limited to whatever \"linelength\" was for your Unix de jour. So if, for example, your terminal had 16 function and other keys, and your linelength was say 1024 (a common value in pre-terminfo days), you may have had difficulty putting all of those attributes in. With terminfo, your source file size could be much greater and this problem did not occur.\nAnother important difference between termcap and terminfo was that in the former you could arbitrarily create attribute names and give them values; with terminfo, you could only include what tic (or whatever corresponding utility you had) supported.\n \nTedickey: Responding to the first, that's brought out and discussed in detail in TCTEST - A Termcap Test Utility, noting that the 1023-byte limit is computed differently for BSD4.3 and later (since excess whitespace is discarded on loading into the terminal database).  Compiled terminfo entries are limited to 4096 bytes.  In both cases, that is a conventional limit which could be altered (at the cost of portability).   For the second, that's true enough, but ncurses has (since 1999) supported user-defined capabilities. Other implementations do not do this; however there is nothing in the terminfo syntax which prevents this (ncurses being an example). At the moment, looking over the topic I see that I did not mention this fact in this topic.   \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack? \nTrue\nFalse\n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either True or False with without using any other words.\n",

I noticed that there was a note on the picture explaining that this graph is not a plain probability graphed in semi-log scale, but given the explanation above, you can see how a non-expert audience can be mislead just by reading the section and looking at the picture that a uniform distribution follows Benford's law.   \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack? \nTrue\nFalse\n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either True or False with without using any other words.\n",

In the case of Barack Obama, his lack of a son that shares his name adds an extra layer of ambiguity because the death of his father allowed him to drop the suffix entirely and that seems to be the route he took.  In most cases the addition of Jr. or Sr. is not a legal name, but is just an addition used to differentiate the father from the son. So the birth certificate of a person that shares their name with their father will frequently not include Junior, but will just be their name (So Barack Hussein Obama, rather than Barack Hussein Obama, Jr.).   \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack? \nTrue\nFalse\n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either True or False with without using any other words.\n",

The use of kilometres rather than miles violates the principle of least astonishment.  In my view, it is better that readers be exposed to this when they are sitting at their computers rather than sitting at the steering wheel.

The problem with that thinking is that it leads editors tto shoehorn material into places it really doesn't make sense for it to go.

It bears on his politics because it raises questions about his moralizing on issues related to sex.  A more logical approach, by far, would be to treat this matter in a section devoted more exclusively to it, or to other controversies.  It's much more in line with the way that a full-length biographical work would deal with it.  Marvin Kitman's biography, for instance, includes a separate chapter on the lawsuit.   \nBytebear:  I disagree.

However, if we are to briefly digress and speculate about their feelings for each other, I would suggest that you bring to mind all the uncontested actions of the two, and then picture Selim as your own son and Lawrence as a neighbor, and see where your reason guides you. I might also suggest that if Dahoum had been a woman there would be scant opposition to the suggestion that the two had been in a love relationship. Finally, please bear in mind that no conclusions about any ''sexual'' aspect to their relationship have been drawn. There is a huge gulf between love, even erotic love, as this seems to have been, and sexuality per se. Regarding your mention of \"unanimity\", none is implied nor is it needed or even possible.

The time period and location has to be taken into consideration, it would be absurd for me to think in 2006 Illinois customs, culture and statutes.  1912 Carchemish? Unless I caught the fellows in the act, I wouldn't think there was anything more than \"that nice man is teaching my son English and my son is helping him improve his Arabic\".  A boy Dahoum's age was considered old enough to marry so he wasn't a child in status.  Swimming nude was cited as possible proof but it is flimsy because it was the norm in many cultures and countries in that time for men to swim nude in a male-only environment.\n\"I might also suggest that if Dahoum had been a woman there would be scant opposition to the suggestion that the two had been in a love relationship.\"\nScant opposition?  If Dahoum/Selim was a young woman, became friends with TEL and was caught in his presence unaccompanied, there'd be more than \"scandalous amusement\" poor Selima would be branded a ''sharmouta'', Lawrence an adulterer and they would likely both be punished, perhaps killed, with Selima getting the harsher punishment.  Best case scenario would be someone thinking Lawrence would make a suitable husband and moving to arrange marriage.\n\"Regarding your mention of \"unanimity\", none is implied nor is it needed or even possible. I can't really speak to the other claims of the KC article.\"\nPerhaps it's my American English but \"scholars\" without a qualifier makes it read like the author (in this case you, the person known on Wikipedia as Haiduc ) has concluded that all scholars believe that S.A. is Selim Ahmed with the certainty that an elm is a tree.  I see you've changed that to most since I was last online.  That's a little less 100%-ish.\nOn to other items: Sheikh Hamoudi tends to be omitted in a number of the \"TEL and Dahoum were lovers\"-theory articles.  Hamoudi I believe shared quarters with Lawrence and Dahoum and it is definite that he and Dahoum ''both'' accompanied Lawrence on a visit to England.  That doesn't discount any more-than-friends/friends-with-bennies possibility but authors keeping Hamoudi out of the picture reads like an omission of convenience.\nThe only house carving I know of at or near the Carchemish dig was a lintel that TEL carved in Hittite style TEL and others in the know found it amusing that some observers thought it was a genuine artifact.  I did read that a gargoyle based on Dahoum was carved by Lawrence.  I'm not sure which house it was placed upon but I did read that it was based on nude sketches.  I'll have to pick the brains of some folks I know who are practically walking Lawrence studies encyclopedias who can point me to the reading material and sources.  You might want to snip the footnotes a bit, especially the Ryouko Yagitani one they're starting to outgrow the main article.\nPlacing Selim Ahmed (Dahoum) in the Pederasty category says to me that you absolutely believe that Dahoum and Lawrence were lovers at some level.  I'm certainly not opposed to Lawrence/Dahoum but my problem with you is that you have this tendency to bludgeon the reader with your opinions and conclusions.

Ideally, others will come along to help edit the article and act as a \"reality check\" to both parties.

I propose a \"cooling off\" period of two weeks, so that adequate time may be given for others to respond to the RfC and perhaps move this process along. By \"cooling off\", I mean no more editing of the core text of the article during that time.

If there's no response to the RfC after two weeks, then I suggest taking it to formal mediation.\nKevin:  I have some more opinions as well, that might be useful now.

I also remind you that Its not my page as you seem to thank. \nRyulong: This reasoning you are putting forth is original research, which is not allowed on Wikipedia. It might pass on some fanwiki, but unless you can find a reliable source that specifically calls \"Awakened Mewtwo\" a \"Forme\" then it should not be referred to as such on Wikipedia. I've shown sources (in Japanese) used in the article that refer to it simply as a \"form\" or in Japanese ''sugata'', rather than a \"Forme\", which in Japanese is ''Forumu''.\nAnd even then, a \"Forme\" is still a \"form\". Using the latter terminology is more general and the former is still a silly little piece of game jargon that should only be used as part of the name of the form rather than making it something completely unique amongst forms. \"Giratina has an alternate form called Origin Forme\" is a perfectly valid sentence. There is no need to change \"form\" to \"Forme\" in that sentence.\nSo, based on these two very valid reasons, the word \"Forme\" should not be used in conjunction with discussing \"Awakened Mewtwo\". Unless it is revealed that \"Awakened Mewtwo\" gets some new unique name in Japan like \"Myūtsū Kakusei Forumu\" then \"Forme\" can be used, and even then it's not necessary to refer to \"Awakened Forme\" as \"an alternate Forme\" because that's just bad English due to the fact that Game Freak decided to go with the French word  instead of the English word .—  \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack? \nTrue\nFalse\n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either True or False with without using any other words.\n",

What a nonsense!\nBesides, Valencian has an english wikipage and Castilian does not, being redirected to [Spanish language]]. Therefore, using castilian is an unproper use of English language.\nValencian/Catalan argument:\nYou deny the AVL to state the difference between both languages.

Even the '''Valencia Autonomy Statute''' (some laws quite importants for you pan-catalanist people), described the official language as \"Valencià\"\nHistory section argument:\nNobody is denying that a vast majority of aragonese colons were from Catalonia (which lets not forget '''DID NOT''' exist as such until centuries later), or from the Principality of Catalonia (Which is a legal term (in Latin principatus) that appeared in XIV century to name the territory under jurisdiction of Catalan Cortes, the sovereign of which (in Latin, princeps) was the '''king of Aragón''', without being formally a kingdom).\nThe problem is the use of \"Catalan people\" and redirecting that to \"Catalonia\". That is simple historically unaccurate in those ages. You could change the sentence to ''\"James I \"the Conqueror\" led Aragonese colonization of the Islamic taifas of Valencia and Dénia with colons of catalan origin\"'', for example. That, ''could'' be accurate.\nHistory facts argument:\nYou tell me that I am not giving any reasons for the changes. > Well, then what have I been doing with  last 48 hours???

Here we can find some '''WORLWIDE KNOWN''' valencian territories such as Catalonia, Balearic Islands,Northern Catalonia, Franja de Ponent, '''Andorra''' (My GOD, this should be studied by the UN, being Andorra an independent state, it becomes valencian!!!), L'Alguer and Carxe. Some of these are even using improper catalan names instead of the official ones, (but of course, I am an \"anti-catalan\"...).\nNext section, \"Government and Politics\". Here we can find some '''ABSOLUTLY''' related links for Valencia, such as Generalitat de Catalunya, Govern de les Illes Balears, Consell General de les Valls (Andorra), the funny Politics of Catalonia and the hillarious Catalan nationalism\nLast two sections, \"Traditions\". We have links to '''DEEP IN THE HEART'''valencian traditions such as Castells, Sardana, Caganer or Tió de Nadal (ALL OF THEM BEING '''>UNIQUE<''' to Catalonia.

Again, it was not celebration of destruction. The destruction day was Dec 6 and they were returning on Feb 27. The nearest event on Ayodhya that time was the Purna Ahuti Yagya , which started on Feb 18, 2002. I think the validity of the source needs to be rechecked.

And these two historians *accept that lesser number of Indians died compared to Persians*. In other words, it seems that the combat effectiveness of the force of a small Indian regional kingdom was greater than the much vaunted army of the Ancient World's superpower, Persia.\"\nFor Khirurg, page 35 paragraph 2: \"Military Revolution or not, Alexander's victory however was not inevitable. When Alexander was forming his infantry who had just crossed the river and were organizing themselves in a phalanx, then a few squadrons of Greek Cavalry screened their front. At that time if Porus, whose army was already organized in battle formation, had attacked the unready Greek Army with his elephants, then all hell would've broken loose upon the Macedonian \"world conqueror\".\" There is also further analysis, but I think I have backed my edits enough.\nP.S. that Hot Climate and Armor factor is also discussed on Page 35 first paragraph of the text.\nI will correct the source errors ASAP.

I am redirecting \"Euclidean natural units\" to this page either way. — Reinyday,\nCurrere: To be valid at 45 degrees, the duration of the time unit has to equal one, but that duration is not that of the second. The current SI definition for the speed of light is just that, a definition, which provides a reference numeric value for everyone to use.  The Euclidean definition provides a numeric value with near unlimited precision.\nThe dimension set that was identified in an old document was 47.713 cm at 26.25400 degrees (there was a scaling factor). The old document did not express this in centimeters, but I use centimeters so others will not have to convert the value.  Once I recognized that the dimension represented a wavelength, it was then finding the mathematical form that represented the general case. I was astounded by how much technical and mathematical information was expressed by that simple dimension. I was also astounded that somebody over a century ago knew how to express that technical information in that form, let alone knowing the 21 cm wavelength. The author that recorded the information did not have a clue as to what it meant.\nThe only thing original in \"Euclidean Natural Units\" is substituting wavelengths and frequencies as values in a right triangle. Wavelengths, frequencies and triangles are already defined, it was just a matter of implementing these relationships in a mathematical form. There is no process to describe this form of substition, and it seemed logical to assign the name that fits the geometric form.\n because it's original research.  it might also be crap.  WP does have standards, even though it is still heavily criticized for being unreliable.\nIn practice, the only thing original is substituting wavelengths and frequencies for the elements of a right triangle. \n i asked 3 times, other than an allusion to the speed of light, you mentioned '''nothing''' about what physical constants get normalized or set to a known quantity with these so-called \"natural units\".  i don't think that you understand the topic matter and are unable to make a real contribution because you just show no evidence that you understand what this is.  \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack? \nTrue\nFalse\n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either True or False with without using any other words.\n",

Through him God did so many miracles and he had good revelations through holy spirit. He was giving shoulder to Paster Paul. But why now a days Pentecostal people want to put down Pastor Alwin? Just why do TPM want to high light Pastor Paul and not Pastor Alwin? Is it just because majority members of TPM is Malayalees or from Kerala? What wrong Pastor Alwin did? It's not TPM to justify about Pastor Alwin? It's going to be a real shock for TPM when they see Pastor Alwin in heaven in glorious place. God is going to justify everyone and their deeds. I heard Pastor Alwin was beaten up by other Pastor's of TPM just to make son of Pastor Paul as chief Pastor and some stories were cooked off by Kerala People that he was naked in his room. Even if he is naked in his room God only knows he would have been in his higher spiritual divine experience where Adam and Eve were not knowing that they were naked before they did sin. But as far as all Pentecostal people know Pastor Alwin was a very disciplined person who has been a model for many TPM believers. Even Pastor Alwin's entire family was fully dedicated for the ministry and all of us should be thankful for hsi sacrificial work.

Nobody here disputes that there are a myriad of terms which can refer to the tuatara: \"reptile\", \"amniote\", \"diapsid\", \"basal diapsid\", \"sphenodont\", \"Sauropsid\", etc.\nI further think that we've resolved the issue of paraphyly being a problem - we're using ITIS classification, and \"reptilia/sauropsida\" is recognized in both ITIS and the scientific literature, regardless of the paraphyletic nature of the clade.\nThis, IMHO, leaves only the issue of communication.  Which term is best for the intro?\nPersonally, I favor reptile for the following reasons:\n1) It's clear and understandable to most readers\n2) Other, potentially less-clear terms, would either confuse the reader or have them click the link, which, while accurate, would disrupt the reading of the introductory sentence.  To me, that seems like a rather serious impediment to readability.\n3) Other terms do not contain any more information.  They are either taxonomically equivalent or nearly so.\n4) Further details on the animal and it's exact phylogeny are laid out in the next section.\nOk, let's try to resolve this thing without killing each other.

I don't like the continuation of that last sentence, though I could perhaps live with it.  The problem with all of that material is that ''it isn't about Debito Arudou''.

It does not add any new sources, re-writes the article so that it is only slightly based in the sources, and adds new ideas which are not found in the sources. It replaces the high-quality explanations that existed for new, confused and low-quality explanations. It removes and unjustifiably re-locates information. More specifically:\n'''''Marxism–Leninism''' is an ideology of socioeconomic and sociopolitical relations. Its proponents consider it to be based on Marxism and Leninism. Moreover, many of them have considered it to be the only legitimate version of either of those, although many other people with Marxian, Marxist, or Leninist ideas disagree. The Russian Civil War made Leninism the dominant form of Marxism in Russia, and after Lenin's death, Joseph Stalin and his supporters asserted the indivisible unity of Marxism and Leninism by renaming them both with a single name.''\nMarxism-Leninism is not an indivisible unity of Marxism and Leninism promoted by Stalin and his followers. It is the own ideological creation of Stalin and his followers, as the reliable sources clearly state.\n''is usually etically viewed as a totalitarian form of socialism (in contrast with democratic socialism) despite its own view (the emic view) that it is democratic because soviets are a form (the ultimate form) of democracy.''\nWhether it is genuinely a \"form of socialism\" really is a big matter of debate between the different socialist tendencies. Democratic socialism does not refer to a democratic kind of socialism, but is rather a specific tendency of social democracy. Many anti-authoritarian and democratic socialist ideologies are not known as \"democratic socialist\", and it would be completely incorrect to refer to them as so. Whether the USSR was actually \"Soviet democracy\" is only said by Stalinists and this makes it look like \"Soviet democracy\" is not regarded a form of democracy. The debate is whether the USSR was a Soviet democracy or not, not whether Soviet democracy is democratic.\n''The Sino-Soviet split was driven mainly by Mao Zedong's disapproval of de-Stalinization in the Soviet Union. He considered this Soviet reformism as revisionism in all the worst senses of that word, including negation of correct ideas. The reaction against such Marxist revisionism (called Anti-Revisionism) became a part of Maoism. Just as Lenin had aimed to take the ''Marxist'' label away from any Marxist who was not Bolshevik (most famously the Mensheviks), and just as Stalin had aimed to take the ''Marxist'' and ''Leninist'' labels away from any Bolshevik who was not Stalinist (most famously the Trotskyists), so too did the Maoists aim to take the ''Marxist–Leninist'' label away from any communist who was not Stalinist or Maoist. They did so by declaring that Marxism–Leninism–Maoism was now the only correct and legitimate form of Marxism–Leninism.''\nThis information definitely belongs somewhere else.\nThere is no reason for moving out the summary of the views of the rest of the Marxist movement out of the lead. It is clearly marked as criticism, and is obviously relevant seeing as the article deals with an ideology which claims itself to be the legitimate heir of Marxism.  \nTrust Is All You Need:   Karmanatory's version is the better of the two.   \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack? \nTrue\nFalse\n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either True or False with without using any other words.\n",

They used it simply referring to the Irish Republican Army (the \"Provisional\" flavour of the IRA in particular) as a paramilitary group (including probably its unestablished/alleged links to Sinn Féin - but as these links are all but in the open they did not refer to the \"political party\" aspect at all, exclusively to the aspects outside the official state organisation).\nI'll re-establish the republican article as I last left it, and add a clarifying reference to justify ''disambig'' instead of ''redirect'', '''''and''''' I expect discussion here for avoidance of further vandalism.\n \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack? \nTrue\nFalse\n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either True or False with without using any other words.\n",

This not only cleary states what is described by the list, offers no interpretation, no disambiguation and permits the creation of further list such as List of tallest buildings and structures in Haute-Normandie, or ''List of tallest buildings and structures in Limousin'' instead of ''List of tallest buildings and structures in the Limoges region''.

Sure, the best telescopes couldn't resolved it as anything more then a point of light, but that's ok. And everyone was happy. Until Pallas was discovered. \"Well, that's ok. We'll have another planet!\" And then came Juno. \"And another!\" After some time, they eventually realised that thousands of these odd \"Asteroids\" would be found, and that they couldn't fit in well with the big planets known at the time (Mercury to Neptune). So then the planet count went back down to 8. Until Pluto was discovered. Pretty much the same thing happened, it was definently a planet, although an oddball too. Until 1992. Something else was found beyond Neptune. It was smaller, but it was in the same area. Doubt lingered, but then along came some others. Sedna, Quaoar, and then \"X\". We face the same problem today. We ''know'' that out there is something like an asteroid belt, but with ice instead of rock. Perhaps \"X\" and Pluto would just be really big comets in the Kuiper Belt.  Maybe if something is mostly made of ice, it can't be a planet, because if brought close to the Sun, it vanishes pretty quickly. It would look nice sure, in it's death pangs, but when all is said and done... the system ''I'' thought they'd choose wouldn't have an arbitrary barrier at 800 km for size, but at say... Mercury.

You literally CREATED a situation that would lead to a pointless argument battleground and then a blame game about who did what: unethical. Do you not see that you cannot ethically expect what appears to be your \"primary enemy\" on Wikipedia to be held to a different standard than you, yourself, can you? Just because one user commits a simple mistake is no excuse to lambast at them for forgetting Wikipedia policy. This breaches the civility on this project.  Similarly, there was no reason to pursue my edits and take them as canvassing. It was just taking an admin's point of view and what could have been done to better the situation. We were both wrong alright. Simply trying to show who's right and who's wrong will only worsen your day and mine.  Just because there's been a disagreement does not give you an excuse tomcome out with an array of personal attacks on my talk page in any kind. Similarly, talking bad about me here  will not solve anything.  The more likely you are to leave me alone, the better it would be for you and yourself.  I am telling you for the umpteenth time that I am NOT 100% clear with the Wikipedian policies, and I am taking advice from an admin that will help resolve this bad blood between us because this situation is spiraling out of my own control. Last but not least, if it was a dispute with that Forrest Gump quote edit, I didn't understand it and I should have went to you for clarification. Lesson learnt. SImilarly, there was no need to talk behind my back on  and insulting me with great animosity. We all make mistakes on Wikipedia. Learn to accept mistakes of others, as I will do to yours. The more likely we are going to accept the mistakes of others and then discuss it in an appropriate fashion, the more likely it will help us to be better people to one another and the less likely we would spiral into pointless chaotic quagmires such as this. I'm not interested who started this all, but we both did, and I suggest you take a break and have a think about what I have just said before coming to reply here any further. \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack? \nTrue\nFalse\n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either True or False with without using any other words.\n",

Li lives in the United States, but nationality is not defined by place of residence alone, but also by national identity.  I suggest keeping nationality as \"Chinese,\" but listing place of residency as United States. On the citizenship question,  the same editor is writing that Li became a citizen in the 1990s.  This claim is sourced (incorrectly) to Time magazine,  as well as to Reuters (which gives a one line \"Li, a US citizen, ...\"), and encyclopedia Britannica, which curiously states that Li became a U.S. citizen in 1997 and settled in the U.S. in 1998.  I reverted this previously because, according to the preponderance of sources (and better sources),  it's not the case.  Palmer, among others, states that Li settled permanently in the United States in 1998 under an investor immigration status, which granted him permanent residency, but not citizenship.  David Ownby states that Li \"moved to the United States in 1996 but did not received his green card until 1998\" (a green card, in case it's not clear, is for permanent residency, not citizenship). The Time magazine article that was incorrectly used to attribute the claim that Li is a citizen instead states \"Li decided to apply for immigration to the U.S.\" in 1997. As anyone who has ever attempted to navigate the labyrinthine maze of USCIS knows, one does not decide to apply for immigration to the U.S. and mysteriously gain citizenship the same year. Many other sources also state that Li is a permanent resident, not a citizen, and Li himself said this in 1999. If there are no sound objections, I am going to change back to state that Li's nationality is Chinese, and that he became a permanent resident in 1998.   \n\nWill the previouse conversation eventually derail into a personal attack? \nTrue\nFalse\n\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain, you must pick either True or False with without using any other words.\n",

()\nJohnbod: There are certainly more books than 4-5 (even Commons has images from more than that), and were almost certainly more than now exist, as the survival rate for this and other forms of medieval Islamic art is low, as manuscripts were concentrated in court libraries, which tended to have fires sooner or later. I have just been addressing this issue at the other page. The only person cited in the source (Arnold, itself of 1928) as believing they did not exist is a single German writing in 1906. He is certainly wrong, and it is deliberately misleading to include this point, with the implication there might be something in it, in a very brief lead.  Much longer modern accounts understandably never mention it.  The court miniature traditions are generally accepted as a major aspect of Islamic art, though enjoyment of them was restricted to a tiny minority of the population - but this was true of many other forms of art, calligraphy for one.  The number of surviving manuscripts is not enormous & images of Muhammad appear pretty regularly in manuscripts of history and poetry which cover his life, and some genealogies etc.  The subject is certainly not \"by definition \"historical trivia\"\".
