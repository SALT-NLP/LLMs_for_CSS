    <Title>FLUTE Figurative Language - Qualification Test</Title>
    <FormattedContent><![CDATA[
    <h1> Instructions </h1>
    <p>You will read two short sentences, one literal and one figurative, and you'll help judge the quality of how the descriptions explain the <b>figurative language</b> that links them in a given RELATIONSHIP. SENTENCE 1 (which is also called the premise) is literal and SENTENCE 2 (which is also called the hypothesis) is figurative. They have a RELATIONSHIP, which says whether the literal first sentence makes the second sentence true (Entailment) or makes the second sentence false (Contradiction). To understand the RELATIONSHIP, we need to understand figurative language, and the EXPLANATION describes the figurative language.</p>

    <h5>Please closely read the examples below of Fully Correct EXPLANATION 1s and some incorrect EXPLANATION 2s. These directly relate to the qualification questions below.</h5>

              A sauna is a hot and moist environment, so the simile is saying that the hall is even hotter and more moist than usual.

              The explanation is supposed to describe the meaning behind the figurative language, and EXPLANATION 2 only gives the relationship as Entailment.

              The figurative language in the hypothesis is hyperbole, as the speaker is unlikely to be truly ecstatic about being left behind.
