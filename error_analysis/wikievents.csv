There were no fatalities but 33 people were injured , some severely . Two off - duty soldiers lost their legs as a result of the bombing . == Background == In February 1975 the Provisional Irish Republican Army agreed to a truce and ceasefire with the British government and the Northern Ireland Office . Seven "" incident centres "" were established in Irish nationalist areas in Northern Ireland to monitor the ceasefire and the activity of the security forces . Before the truce , the IRA active service unit ( ASU ) later dubbed the Balcombe Street Gang ( due to the December 1975 Balcombe Street siege ) had been carrying out bomb and gun attacks in Southern England since autumn 1974 , mostly in and around London . Their last previous attack was an assassination attempt on former Prime Minister Edward Heath but he was not home when the attackers <tgr>threw <tgr>a bomb into his bedroom window on 22 December 1974 . == The bombing == The Balcombe Street Gang planted a time bomb in the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham , Surrey . The IRA unit placed the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat . There was no warning and the bomb exploded at 9 : 20 , injuring 23 civilians and 10 off - duty soldiers . The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby . Some of the injuries were very serious , with at least three soldiers losing limbs . The blast blew the roof off the pub in the process . This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign ( Phase Two ) in England and the end of the truce with the British Government . The next day , the same IRA unit exploded a bomb in Oxford Street , injuring several people . == Aftermath ==

On Friday , Colombia blamed the leftist ELN for the bombing of a police academy in Bogota that killed 20 people as well as the attacker , dealing a big blow to the peace process . 190102132047518 Duque then announced that he was reinstating arrest warrants for 10 ELN members , who are part of the group ’ s delegation to the Cuba talks . The talks were aimed at ending more than five decades of fighting by the Marxist - inspired group . Duque said that Cuba must not protect the rebels . The police academy car bombing “ was a crime that violated human rights and no such act deserves [ Cuba acting ] to avoid justice being done ” , Duque said while giving a speech in Tolima . Colombians , including Duque , planned to join in a march on Sunday to protest against the car bombing , the worst such attack in the country in 16 years . Last rebel group In November , Colombia asked Cuba to <tgr>capture <tgr>ELN rebel commander Nicolas Rodriguez and provide information about the presence of other commanders in the Cuban territory . The government in Bogota also asked Havana to act on an Interpol Red Notice against Rodriguez . The Cuban government did not respond publicly to that request or made a statement about the issue . Colombia has experienced several years of relative calm since the 2016 peace accord signed by then - President Juan Manuel Santos and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) fighters . 190118182118648 With the landmark agreement turning the former rebels into a political party , the smaller ELN is considered the last active rebel group in the country . True to his election promises , Duque has taken a hard line against the ELN . Peace talks with the ELN began in February 2017 under Santos , but Duque has put them on hold until the rebels free all their hostages and stop attacks on military and civilian targets . The group is believed to be currently holding 17 hostages , some of them for several years .

Thailand authorities have not officially named the bombing of Erawan Shrine an act of terror , and accordingly neither suspect was charged specifically with terrorism .

DJI Matrice 600 drones are a commercial model , normally used for industrial work — with a U .

Bellingcat says its analysis supports the government ’ s claim that the drone model used was a DJI Matrice 600 , noting that the drones involved in the event each had six rotors . It also points to a photo of drone wreckage which appears to show the distinctive silver rotor tip of the model , although it also notes the drones appear to have had their legs removed . Venezuela ’ s interior minister , Nestor Reverol , also claimed the government thwarted the attack using "" special techniques and [ radio ] signal inhibitors "" , which "" disoriented "" the drone that <tgr>detonated <tgr>closest to the presidential stand — a capability Bellingcat notes the Venezuelan security services are reported to have . The second drone was said by Reverol to have "" lost control "" and crashed into a nearby building . Bellingcat says it is possible to geolocate the video of the falling drone to the same location as the fire in the apartment that firefighters had claimed was caused by a gas canister explosion . It adds that images taken of this location during the fire show a hole in the wall of the apartment in the vicinity of where the drone would have crashed . "" It is a very likely possibility that the downed drone subsequently detonated , creating the hole in the wall of this apartment , igniting a fire , and causing the sound of the second explosion which can be heard in Video 2 [ of the state TV broadcast of Maduro ’ s speech ] , "" it further suggests .

Bush . Obama embraced the US drone programme , overseeing more strikes in his first year than Bush carried out during his entire presidency . A total of 563 strikes , largely by drones , targeted Pakistan , Somalia and Yemen during Obama ’ s two terms , compared to 57 strikes under Bush . Between 384 and 807 civilians were <tgr>killed <tgr>in those countries , according to reports logged by the Bureau . The use of drones aligned with Obama ’ s ambition to keep up the war against al Qaeda while extricating the US military from intractable , costly ground wars in the Middle East and Asia . But the targeted killing programme has drawn much criticism . The Obama administration has insisted that drone strikes are so “ exceptionally surgical and precise ” that they pluck off terror suspects while not putting “ innocent men , women and children in danger ” . This claim has been contested by numerous human rights groups , however , and the Bureau ’ s figures on civilian casualties also demonstrate that this is often not the case . The White House released long - awaited figures last July on the number of people killed in drone strikes between January 2009 and the end of 2015 , an announcement which insiders said was a direct response to pressure from the Bureau and other organisations that collect data . However the US ’ s estimate of the number of civilians killed – between 64 and 116 – contrasted strongly with the number recorded by the Bureau , which at 380 to 801 was six times higher . That figure does not include deaths in active battlefields including Afghanistan – where US air attacks have shot up since Obama withdrew the majority of his troops at the end of 2014 . The country has since come under frequent US bombardment , in an unreported war that saw 1 , 337 weapons dropped last year alone – a 40 % rise on 2015 .

Thai officials have said the blast was carried out by a people - smuggling gang seeking revenge on Thai authorities for cracking down on their operation . The August 17 blast at the Erawan Shrine - a popular tourist destination - was one of the most deadly acts of violence in Bangkok in decades , and left 20 people dead and more than 120 injured . Of the dead , 14 were tourists . The attack shocked the residents of the capital because of the apparent randomness , which drove home the point that no place is immune to acts of terror . Authorities , however , have declined to call it an act of terrorism out of apparent fear that it would hurt the country ' s huge tourism industry . Police initially appeared at first to be at a loss , but soon claimed success with a series of raids and two arrests . Arrest warrants have been issued for 15 others . The two suspects were brought to the court in handcuffs wearing brown prison garb .

Two off - duty soldiers lost their legs as a result of the bombing . == Background == In February 1975 the Provisional Irish Republican Army agreed to a truce and ceasefire with the British government and the Northern Ireland Office . Seven "" incident centres "" were established in Irish nationalist areas in Northern Ireland to monitor the ceasefire and the activity of the security forces . Before the truce , the IRA active service unit ( ASU ) later dubbed the Balcombe Street Gang ( due to the December 1975 Balcombe Street siege ) had been carrying out bomb and gun <tgr>attacks <tgr>in Southern England since autumn 1974 , mostly in and around London . Their last previous attack was an assassination attempt on former Prime Minister Edward Heath but he was not home when the attackers threw a bomb into his bedroom window on 22 December 1974 . == The bombing == The Balcombe Street Gang planted a time bomb in the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham , Surrey . The IRA unit placed the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat . There was no warning and the bomb exploded at 9 : 20 , injuring 23 civilians and 10 off - duty soldiers . The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby . Some of the injuries were very serious , with at least three soldiers losing limbs . The blast blew the roof off the pub in the process . This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign ( Phase Two ) in England and the end of the truce with the British Government . The next day , the same IRA unit exploded a bomb in Oxford Street , injuring several people . == Aftermath ==

Prosecutors have accused the Afghan - born U . S . citizen of setting off an explosion in Manhattan ' s Chelsea neighborhood on Sept . 17 . It did not kill anyone but hurt 30 people .

Kieran Conway , who was head of the IRA ’ s intelligence - gathering department in the 1970s , broke a 40 - year silence by the organisation to make the admission . He admitted he was “ appalled and ashamed ” because he claimed the bombing of civilians went against everything it stood for . He said the attacks on The Mulberry Bush and The Tavern in The Town had been in revenge for the <tgr>death <tgr>of IRA bomber James McDade . At first he feared that the timing of the attacks - with very little warning - had been deliberate because “ tempers were high ” . But he was later told that the IRA unit involved had tried to use “ a succession of phone boxes ” which were out of order , significantly delaying the bomb - warning call .

Tokyo metropolitan police said Yasuo Yamamoto , 40 , turned himself in to authorities late Friday in Fukui in western Japan . The small drone <tgr>found <tgr>Wednesday had traces of radiation and triggered fears of potential terrorist attacks using unmanned aerial devices , the prime ministers ' office has said . The infiltration at Japan ' s political headquarters has also raised questions over the level of security there . No one was injured and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was traveling at the time of the incident . Police said Yamamoto was arrested on suspicion of flying the drone and obstructing duties at the prime minister ' s office . He has not been indicted and faces further questioning . Public broadcaster NHK said police quoted the unemployed man as saying he did it to protest the government ' s nuclear energy policy . Fukui is home to about a quarter of Japan ' s 48 reactors , which are currently all offline following the 2011 tsunami - triggered Fukushima plant disaster . Abe ' s administration wants to restart as many of the idled plants as possible . The drone was carrying a small camera and a plastic bottle containing what police suspect was the source of radioactive cesium , levels of which were too low to affect humans or the environment . The suspect said he used the sand from an unspecified location in Fukushima , where radiation levels are still high due to fallouts from the Fukushima Dai - ichi meltdowns , NHK said . The government has set up a task force to work on regulations for the use of small drones while ensuring the security of key government facilities . Drones have become increasingly popular in Japan for industrial , service and entertainment use . At a meeting Friday , task force members cautioned against excessive restrictions on the emerging market for drones .

Colombia has asked Cuba to hand over the rebels affiliated with National Liberation Army ( ELN ) , who were in Havana for peace talks , after a deadly car bombing in Bogota was blamed on the group . Conservative President Ivan Duque <tgr>urged <tgr>Communist - ruled Cuba , a host and one of the guarantors of the peace process , to send home the ELN rebels in Havana . Cuba ’ s foreign minister said in a tweet late on Friday that the country would respect the protocols of the negotiations it had been hosting and was consulting with both parties and the guarantors of the talks . On Friday , Colombia blamed the leftist ELN for the bombing of a police academy in Bogota that killed 20 people as well as the attacker , dealing a big blow to the peace process . 190102132047518 Duque then announced that he was reinstating arrest warrants for 10 ELN members , who are part of the group ’ s delegation to the Cuba talks . The talks were aimed at ending more than five decades of fighting by the Marxist - inspired group . Duque said that Cuba must not protect the rebels . The police academy car bombing “ was a crime that violated human rights and no such act deserves [ Cuba acting ] to avoid justice being done ” , Duque said while giving a speech in Tolima . Colombians , including Duque , planned to join in a march on Sunday to protest against the car bombing , the worst such attack in the country in 16 years . Last rebel group In November , Colombia asked Cuba to capture ELN rebel commander Nicolas Rodriguez and provide information about the presence of other commanders in the Cuban territory . The government in Bogota also asked Havana to act on an Interpol Red Notice against Rodriguez . The Cuban government did not respond publicly to that request or made a statement about the issue . Colombia has experienced several years of relative calm since the 2016 peace accord signed by then - President Juan Manuel Santos and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) fighters . 190118182118648

District Judge Richard Berman asked him to confirm that he intended to plead not guilty to an eight - count indictment filed on Wednesday . "" Yes , sir , "" Rahimi said . Prosecutors have accused the Afghan - born U . S . citizen of setting off an explosion in Manhattan ' s Chelsea neighborhood on Sept . 17 . It did not kill anyone but hurt 30 people . The attack came hours after authorities say another pipe bomb planted by Rahimi went off along the course of a charity road race in New Jersey , although that detonation did not injure anyone . Federal prosecutors also say Rahimi left another bomb in Chelsea that did not go off and several explosive devices in a bag at a train station in Elizabeth , New Jersey . In addition to the New York indictment , Rahimi faces charges from federal and state prosecutors in New Jersey . He was captured after a manhunt that ended when police officers discovered him sleeping in the doorway of a bar in Linden , New Jersey . The confrontation left him with several gunshot wounds , delaying the filing of federal charges and forcing him to make his first court appearance in New Jersey from a hospital bed . Assistant U . S . Attorney Nicholas Lewin told Berman that prosecutors had compiled video clips showing Rahimi ' s movements on the day of the bombings , including leaving his house carrying bags , walking on West 23rd Street where the device went off and planting the second bomb on West 27th Street . He also said the government has records showing Rahimi purchased bomb components online and DNA evidence tying him to the bombs .

During the penalty phase of the judicial proceedings , prosecutors brushed off defense arguments that Tsarnaev was under the strong influence of his older , radicalized brother . Victims speak out Before the sentencing , a somber - looking Tsarnaev , wearing a dark sport jacket with a collared shirt and no tie , sat between his lawyers and listened as 24 people — some victims , some survivors — gave impact statements . They lashed out at him for his “ cowardly ” and “ disgusting ” acts , and several called upon him to apologize , trying to convince him that this would be his last chance to ask for forgiveness .

The court on Tuesday indicted Bilal Mohammed and Mieraili Yusufu on 10 counts connected to the blast , including conspiracy to explode bombs and commit premeditated murder . Thailand authorities have not officially named the bombing of Erawan Shrine an act of terror , and accordingly neither suspect was charged specifically with terrorism . Police issued 17 arrest warrants following the bombing but only Bilal and Mieraili have been detained . They are described as ethnic Uighurs , a minority group based in China ' s Xinjiang region . They have been held in custody since their arrests in late August and early September . Thai officials have said the blast was carried out by a people - smuggling gang seeking revenge on Thai authorities for cracking down on their operation . The August 17 blast at the Erawan Shrine - a popular tourist destination - was one of the most deadly acts of violence in Bangkok in decades , and left 20 people dead and more than 120 injured . Of the dead , 14 were tourists . The attack shocked the residents of the capital because of the apparent randomness , which drove home the point that no place is immune to acts of terror . Authorities , however , have declined to call it an act of terrorism out of apparent fear that it would hurt the country ' s huge tourism industry . Police initially appeared at first to be at a loss , but soon claimed success with a series of raids and two arrests . Arrest warrants have been issued for 15 others . The two suspects were brought to the court in handcuffs wearing brown prison garb . Members of the media were not allowed to enter the court and the indictments took place before the two suspects arrived , said defense lawyer Chuchart Kanpai . Doubts about motive
